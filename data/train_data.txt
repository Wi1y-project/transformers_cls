randomized controlled trial	Purpose: When designing this trial, there was no evidence that salvage chemotherapy (SLC) in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) resulted in substantial prolongation of survival when compared with best supportive care (BSC).
randomized controlled trial	However, SLC is often offered to pretreated patients with AGC for anecdotal reasons.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with AGC with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens involving both fluoropyrimidines and platinum and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 0 or 1 were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to SLC plus BSC or BSC alone.
randomized controlled trial	Choice of SLC-either docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks-was left to the discretion of investigators. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Results: Median OS was 5.
randomized controlled trial	3 months among 133 patients in the SLC arm and 3. 8 months among 69 patients in the BSC arm (hazard ratio, 0. 657; 95% CI, 0. 485 to 0. 891; one-sided P =. 007).
randomized controlled trial	OS benefit for SLC was consistent in most of the prospectively defined subgroups, including age, PS, number of prior treatments, metastatic sites, hemoglobin levels, and response to prior chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	SLC was generally well tolerated, and adverse events were similar in the SLC and BSC arms. We found no median OS difference between docetaxel and irinotecan (5. 2 v 6. 5 months; P =. 116).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest phase III trial comparing SLC plus BSC with BSC alone in AGC. In pretreated patients, SLC is tolerated and significantly improves OS when added to BSC.
randomized controlled trial	Salvage chemotherapy for pretreated gastric cancer: a randomized phase III trial comparing chemotherapy plus best supportive care with best supportive care alone
randomized controlled trial	Background: The value of second-line therapy for metastatic gastric cancer is unclear. So far there are no randomised phase III data comparing second-line chemotherapy to best supportive care (BSC).
randomized controlled trial	In this prospective, multicenter, open label, randomised phase III study we compared irinotecan to BSC to evaluate the impact on survival of second-line chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Eligible patients (pts) had metastatic or locally advanced gastro-oesophageal junction or gastric adenocarcinoma, objective tumour progression during or within 6months after first-line chemotherapy and ECOG performance status 0-2.
randomized controlled trial	Stratification for time of progression after first-line therapy, ECOG PS and pretreatment secured even distribution of important prognostic factors.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment: Arm A: Irinotecan 250mg/m(2)q3w (first cycle) to be increased to 350mg/m(2), depending on toxicity. Arm B: BSC. Findings: Between 10/2002 and 12/2006 40 pts were randomised. The study was closed prematurely due to poor accrual.
randomized controlled trial	Responsefor arm A (19 pts evaluable): No objective responses, SD 53%, PD 47%. Improvement of tumour related symptoms: Arm A 50% of pts, arm B 7%. Overall Survival: (all events in 40 pts have occurred): The hazard ratio for death was reduced to 0.
randomized controlled trial	48 (95%CI 0. 25-0. 92) in the irinotecan-arm (p=0. 012). Median survival arm A: 4. 0months (95% CI 3. 6-7. 5), arm B: 2. 4months (95% CI 1. 7-4. 9).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Irinotecan as second-line chemotherapy significantly prolongs overall survival compared to BSC in the studied pts.
randomized controlled trial	Second-line chemotherapy can now be considered as a proven treatment option for metastatic or locally advanced gastric cancer. Funding: The study was supported by a research grant from Aventis and Pfizer.
randomized controlled trial	Survival advantage for irinotecan versus best supportive care as second-line chemotherapy in gastric cancer--a randomised phase III study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (AIO)
randomized controlled trial	Background: Second-line chemotherapy for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma refractory to platinum and fluoropyrimidines has not shown benefits in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether the addition of docetaxel to active symptom control alone can improve survival and HRQoL for patients. Methods: For this open-labelled, multicentre trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older from 30 UK centres.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were eligible if they had an advanced, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, or stomach that had progressed on or within 6 months of treatment with a platinum-fluoropyrimidine combination.
randomized controlled trial	Patients could have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.
randomized controlled trial	We randomly assigned patients using a central, computerised minimisation procedure to receive docetaxel plus active symptom control, or active symptom control alone (1:1; stratified by disease status, disease site, duration of response to previous chemotherapy, and performance status).
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel was given at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This is the report of the planned final analysis.
randomized controlled trial	This study is an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN13366390. Findings: Between April 21, 2008, and April 26, 2012, we recruited 168 patients, allocating 84 to each treatment group.
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up of 12 months [IQR 10-21]) and 161 (96%) deaths (80 in the docetaxel group, 81 in the active symptom control group), median overall survival in the docetaxel group was 5. 2 months (95% CI 4. 1-5. 9) versus 3. 6 months (3. 3-4.
randomized controlled trial	4) in the active symptom control group (hazard ratio 0. 67, 95% CI 0. 49-0. 92; p=0. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel was associated with higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia (12 [15%] patients vs no patients), infection (15 [19%] patients vs two [3%] patients), and febrile neutropenia (six [7%] patients vs no patients).
randomized controlled trial	Patients receiving docetaxel reported less pain (p=0. 0008) and less nausea and vomiting (p=0. 02) and constipation (p=0. 02). Global HRQoL was similar between the groups (p=0. 53).
randomized controlled trial	Disease specific HRQoL measures also showed benefits for docetaxel in reducing dysphagia (p=0. 02) and abdominal pain (p=0. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Our findings suggest that docetaxel can be recommended as an appropriate second-line treatment for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma that is refractory to treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine.

randomized controlled trial	Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-mediated signalling and angiogenesis can contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to assess whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, prolonged survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial between Oct 6, 2009, and Jan 26, 2012, at 119 centres in 29 countries in North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 24-87 years with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression after first-line platinum-containing or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy were randomly assigned (2:1), via a central interactive voice-response system, to receive best supportive care plus either ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo, intravenously once every 2 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00917384.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 355 patients were assigned to receive ramucirumab (n=238) or placebo (n=117).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 5·2 months (IQR 2·3-9·9) in patients in the ramucirumab group and 3·8 months (1·7-7·1) in those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·776, 95% CI 0·603-0·998; p=0·047).
randomized controlled trial	The survival benefit with ramucirumab remained unchanged after multivariable adjustment for other prognostic factors (multivariable HR 0·774, 0·605-0·991; p=0·042).
randomized controlled trial	Rates of hypertension were higher in the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group (38 [16%] vs nine [8%]), whereas rates of other adverse events were mostly similar between groups (223 [94%] vs 101 [88%]).
randomized controlled trial	Five (2%) deaths in the ramucirumab group and two (2%) in the placebo group were considered to be related to study drug.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Ramucirumab is the first biological treatment given as a single drug that has survival benefits in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma progressing after first-line chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Our findings validate VEGFR-2 signalling as an important therapeutic target in advanced gastric cancer. Funding: ImClone Systems.
randomized controlled trial	Ramucirumab monotherapy for previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (REGARD): an international, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial
meta analysis	Background: Salvage systemic therapy has become the new standard of care in patients with advanced gastric and oesophago-gastric junction (OGJ) adenocarcinoma, following disease progression on first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy.
meta analysis	Pharmacological agents proven to be effective in this setting include both chemotherapy and biological therapy, however, the consensus on the best salvage systemic therapy has not been reached.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the effects of systemic chemotherapy and biological therapy, either alone or in combination, on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced gastric and OGJ adenocarcinoma, whose disease has progressed on, or relapsed after first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy.
meta analysis	Adverse events (AEs), tumour response rate (TRR) and quality of life (QoL) associated with systemic chemotherapy and/or biological therapy were additionally assessed.
meta analysis	Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, trial registries and proceedings of the major oncology conferences up to October 2020.
meta analysis	We additionally handsearched the reference lists of studies. No language restriction was applied.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing salvage systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or biological therapy) and either another type of salvage systemic therapy, placebo, best supportive care (BSC) or no treatment in patients with gastric and OGJ adenocarcinoma refractory to first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed selection of eligible studies and the primary author extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies.
meta analysis	We assessed the quality and risk of bias of eligible studies according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
meta analysis	We expressed pooled estimates of effect using hazard ratio (HR) calculated using an inverse variance random-effects model for time-to-event data, and risk ratio (RR) calculated using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model for binary data.
meta analysis	The certainty of evidence was graded using GRADEpro. Main results: We identified 17 RCTs with 5110 participants for inclusion in this review. Tweenty-nine studies are ongoing and twenty studies are awaiting classification.
meta analysis	No studies examined the following comparisons: chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus placebo, BSC or no treatment, chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus biological therapy, biological therapy versus biological therapy and chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus chemotherapy combined with biological therapy.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy versus placebo, best supportive care or no treatment Chemotherapy probably improves OS (HR = 0. 66, 95% CI 0. 52 to 0. 83, moderate-certainty evidence) based on two studies involving 547 participants and improves PFS (HR = 0.
meta analysis	57, 95% CI 0. 47 to 0. 69, high-certainty evidence) based on one study involving 507 participants over placebo and BSC. Chemotherapy probably increases serious AEs (SAEs) (RR = 1. 38, 95% CI 1. 20 to 1.
meta analysis	59, moderate-certainty evidence) based on one study involving 503 participants. Biological therapy versus placebo, best supportive care or no treatment Biological therapy improves OS (HR = 0. 55, 95% CI 0. 41 to 0.
meta analysis	73, high-certainty evidence) and probably improves PFS (HR = 0. 33, 95% CI 0. 19 to 0. 57, moderate-certainty evidence) over placebo based on three studies involving 781 participants.
meta analysis	There is currently insufficient evidence for increased SAEs from biological therapy (RR = 1. 14, 95% CI 0. 95 to 1. 37, low-certainty evidence) based on two studies involving 638 participants.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy versus biological therapy This comparison only considered immunotherapy. There is probably no evidence of a difference for OS (HR = 0. 82, 95% CI 0. 66 to 1.
meta analysis	02, moderate-certainty evidence) between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and immunotherapy probably reduces PFS (HR = 1. 27, 95% CI 1. 03 to 1. 57, moderate-certainty evidence) based on one study involving 395 participants.
meta analysis	SAEs may be less frequent with immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy (RR = 0. 41, 95% CI 0. 30 to 0. 57, low-certainty evidence).
meta analysis	Chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus chemotherapy Addition of biological therapy to chemotherapy probably does not improve OS (HR = 0. 93, 95% CI 0. 83 to 1.
meta analysis	04, moderate-certainty evidence) and we are uncertain whether it improves PFS (HR = 0. 87, 95% CI 0. 74 to 1. 02, very low-certainty evidence) based on seven studies involving 2743 participants.
meta analysis	We are similarly uncertain whether combined chemotherapy and biological therapy increases SAEs (RR = 1. 17, 95% CI 0. 95 to 1. 44, very low-certainty evidence) based on four studies involving 1618 participants.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy versus chemotherapy There is no evidence of a difference for OS and PFS between irinotecan and paclitaxel (HR = 1. 13, 95% CI 0. 86 to 1. 48, low-certainty evidence for OS; HR = 1. 14, 95% CI 0. 88 to 1.
meta analysis	48, low-certainty evidence for PFS) based on one study involving 219 participants. Similarly, there is no evidence to indicate improved OS and PFS from addition of another chemotherapy to docetaxel (HR = 1. 05, 95% CI 0. 72 to 1.
meta analysis	54, low-certainty evidence for OS; HR = 0. 75, 95% CI 0. 52 to 1. 09, low-certainty evidence for PFS) based on two studies involving 121 participants.
meta analysis	Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia occurred commonly with both mono- and poly-chemotherapy except for docetaxel-S1 and EOX chemotherapy.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: Survival outcome of patients with advanced gastric and OGJ adenocarcinoma whose disease progressed on first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy can be improved by chemotherapy and biological therapy.
meta analysis	Biological therapy, in particular, achieves this without clear increase in SAEs or QoL impairment.
meta analysis	Whether biological therapy is preferred over chemotherapy is still unclear and there is no evidence of a difference for OS outcome, although immunotherapy may be associated with less SAEs.
meta analysis	Addition of biological therapy to chemotherapy and poly-chemotherapy are associated with frequent treatment-related toxicity without clear survival benefit.

Case series	No established second-line chemotherapy is available for patients with advanced gastric cancer failing to respond or progressing to first-line chemotherapy. However, 20-40% of these patients commonly receive second-line chemotherapy.
Case series	We evaluated the influence of clinico-pathologic factors on the survival of 175 advanced gastric cancer patients, who received second-line chemotherapy at three oncology departments.
Case series	Univariate and multivariate analyses found five factors which were independently associated with poor overall survival: performance status 2 (hazard ratio (HR), 1. 79; 95% CI, 1. 16-2. 77; P=0. 008), haemoglobin </=11. 5 g l(-1) (HR, 1. 48; 95% CI, 1.
Case series	06-2. 05; P=0. 019), CEA level >50 ng ml(-1) (HR, 1. 86; 95% CI, 1. 21-2. 88; P=0. 004), the presence of greater than or equal to three metastatic sites of disease (HR, 1. 72; 95% CI, 1. 16-2. 53; P=0.
Case series	006), and time-to-progression under first-line chemotherapy </=6 months (HR, 1. 97; 95% CI, 1. 39-2. 80; P<0. 0001).
Case series	A prognostic index was constructed dividing patients into low- (no risk factor), intermediate- (one to two risk factors), or high- (three to five risk factors) risk groups, and median survival times for each group were 12. 7 months, 7.
Case series	1 months, and 3. 3 months, respectively (P<0. 001).
Case series	In the absence of data deriving from randomised trials, this analysis suggests that some easily available clinical factors may help to select patients with advanced gastric cancer who could derive more benefit from second-line chemotherapy.
Case series	Second-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer: who may benefit?
randomized controlled trial	Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan (CPT-11) monotherapy and CPT-11 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) combination (mFOLFIRI) as second-line treatment in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A total of 59 patients were randomly assigned to either CPT-11 (150 mg/m(2) iv on day 1) or mFOLFIRI (CPT-11 150 mg/m(2) plus LV 20 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by 5-FU 2,000 mg/m(2) over 48 h), every 2 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Results: Following random assignment, 29 patients received CPT-11 and 30 patients mFOLFIRI. The ORR was 17. 2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 4-30. 9] and 20. 0 % (95 % CI 5. 6-34.
randomized controlled trial	3) for the CPT-11 and mFOLFIRI arms, respectively (P = 0. 525). There was no significant difference in median progression-free survival: 2. 2 months (95 % CI 0. 2-4. 3) for CPT-11 versus 3. 0 months (95 % CI 2. 0-3. 7) for mFOLFIRI (P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	481) or in median overall survival: 5. 8 months (95 % CI 3. 0-8. 7), compared with 6. 7 months (95 % CI 5. 3-8. 2) (P = 0. 514). Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 21 and 28 events in the CPT-11 and mFOLFIRI arms, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Although this study had a small sample size and limited statistical power, CPT-11 monotherapy and mFOLFIRI appear to be equally active and tolerable as second-line chemotherapy for AGC.
randomized controlled trial	The addition of 5-FU/LV to CPT-11 did not significantly improve efficacy.
randomized controlled trial	A randomized phase II study of biweekly irinotecan monotherapy or a combination of irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (mFOLFIRI) in patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma refractory to or progressive after first-line chemotherapy
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We compared biweekly irinotecan plus cisplatin (BIRIP) with irinotecan alone as the second-line chemotherapy (SLC) for advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to S-1-based first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive BIRIP (irinotecan 60mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 30mg/m(2), every 2weeks) or irinotecan alone (irinotecan 150mg/m(2), every 2weeks).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end-point was to show the superiority of BIRIP to irinotecan in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Results: 130 patients were enrolled. PFS was significantly longer in the BIRIP group (3. 8months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.
randomized controlled trial	0-4. 7]) than in the irinotecan group (2. 8months [2. 1-3. 3]; hazard ratio 0. 68, 95% CI 0. 47-0. 98; P=0. 0398). Median overall survival was 10. 7months in the BIRIP group and 10. 1months in the irinotecan group (HR 1. 00, 95% CI 0. 69-1. 44, P=0.
randomized controlled trial	9823). The objective response rate was 22% in the BIRIP group and 16% in the irinotecan group (P=0. 4975). However, the disease control rate was significantly better in the BIRIP group (75%) than in the irinotecan group (54%, P=0. 0162).
randomized controlled trial	The incidences of grade 3 or worse adverse events did not differ between the two groups. Any grade elevation of serum creatinine was more common in the BIRIP group (25% versus 8%, P=0. 009), but any grade diarrhoea (17% versus 42%, P=0.
randomized controlled trial	002) was more common in the irinotecan group. Conclusion: BIRIP significantly prolonged PFS as compared with irinotecan alone and was tolerated as SLC, but did not demonstrate the survival benefit in this trial.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine and docetaxel have single-agent activity in upper gastrointestinal tumours, and have together demonstrated preclinical synergy and a survival benefit in breast cancer, and high response rates in first-line metastatic gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This trial assessed the efficacy, safety and feasibility of capecitabine in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic oesophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In all, 24 patients with advanced disease (17 squamous cell carcinoma and seven adenocarcinoma) received oral capecitabine (1000 mg m(-2) twice daily on days 1-14) plus intravenous docetaxel (75 mg m(-2) on day 1) every 3 weeks as first- (n = 16) or second-line (n = 8) therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients received a median of four cycles of treatment (range, 0-6). The median follow-up is 16. 5 months (range, 7. 9-21. 4 months). Intent-to-treat efficacy analysis showed an overall response rate of 46%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Of the 11 responders (one complete and 10 partial), nine of 16 (56%) received first-line and two of eight (25%) received second-line therapy. The median time to progression was 6. 1 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 4. 5-7. 7 months).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The median survival was 15. 8 months (95% CI, 7. 8-23. 9 months).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Severe adverse events (grade 3/4) reported were: neutropenia (42%, including febrile neutropenia 8%), hand-foot syndrome (29%), diarrhoea (13%), sensory neuropathy (13%), anaemia (8%) and fatigue (8%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine plus docetaxel has a manageable adverse event profile and very promising activity in metastatic oesophageal cancer, at least comparable to other doublet regimens. Therefore, the combination merits further investigation in this setting.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine plus docetaxel every 3 weeks in first- and second-line metastatic oesophageal cancer: final results of a phase II trial
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Although paclitaxel was given triweekly in phase II trials prior to its approval for gastric cancer in Japan, it is currently more often delivered by a weekly schedule in the second-line setting.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: A phase II trial with response rate as the primary end-point was conducted.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with metastatic or unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma who had measurable lesions and had disease progression with the front-line chemotherapy were treated by weekly administration of paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m2.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Forty-five patients were accrued and 44 were assessable for response. Partial responses were observed in 7 patients (16%). Stable disease was documented in further 14 patients (48%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Median progression-free survival of all patients enrolled was 2. 6 months and median overall survival was 7. 8 months. Toxicity was mild and manageable, the most frequent > or = grade 3 toxicity being neutropenia occurring in 16% of the patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: With modest response rate, favorable toxicity profile, and progression-free or overall survival similar to those of more intense combination regimens, weekly paclitaxel remains a rational therapeutic option for gastric cancer refractory to the first-line chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A phase II study of weekly paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric Cancer (CCOG0302 study)
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objective: To assess the toxicity and activity of bolus mitomycin C (MMC) in combination with a 24-hour continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in gastric cancer patients who had received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients were treated with MMC (10 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 22, 5-FU (2. 6 g/m(2)) as a 24-hour infusion, and folinic acid 500 mg/m(2) weekly for 6 weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Thirty-four patients with gastric cancer, 16 after failure of first-line chemotherapy and 18 after failure of at least two prior chemotherapies, were included. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 9 (26.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5%) of the 34 patients had a partial response and 10 (29. 4%) a disease stabilization (disease control rate 56%). The median time to progression was 3. 3 months (CI95: 2. 8-3. 7), and the median overall survival was 7. 2 months (CI95: 5. 9-8. 4).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Grade III/IV thrombocytopenia occurred in 14. 7% of patients (n = 5), while the most frequent nonhematological grade III/IV toxicities were mucositis and diarrhea, each affecting 9% of patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: As the tested regimen was generally safe and well tolerated by the patients, MMC plus infusional 5-FU/folinic acid may be a potential second-line regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Mitomycin C plus infusional 5-fluorouracil in platinum-refractory gastric adenocarcinoma: an extended multicenter phase II study
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: To confirm the feasibility and efficacy of biweekly irinotecan (CPT-11) plus cisplatin (CDDP) as third-line chemotherapy, the response rate (RR), overall survival and toxicity were evaluated in patients who had been treated with S-1 as a first-line and paclitaxel as a second-line chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: The eligibility criteria of our study were: i) pathologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach, ii) primary non-resectable or recurrent tumors, iii) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2 or less, iv) age less than 75 years, v) adequate hepatic, renal and bone marrow functions and vi) patients had received S-1 as a first-line and paclitaxel as a second-line chemotherapy and both regimens had failed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The treatment consisted of CPT-11 (60 mg/m2) and CDDP (30 mg/m2) on day 1 and day 15, repeated every 4 weeks. Results: Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All the treatment was administered at the out-patient clinic except the first course for the initial 4 patients. The overall RR was 23. 1% in all and 30.
Non-randomized controlled trial	0% in the patients with target tumors (6 partial response, 11 stable disease, 7 progressive disease, 2 non-evaluable). Overall grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 5 patients (19.
Non-randomized controlled trial	2%) including pancytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, anorexia and elevation of AST/ALT. The time-to-treatment failure and the median survival time were 95 and 299 days, respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Biweekly CPT-11 plus CDDP was feasible for S-1- and paclitaxel-refractory metastatic gastric cancer, with moderate activity and favorable toxicity. This regimen was safely performed at the out-patient clinic as third-line chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Feasibility study of biweekly CPT-11 plus CDDP for S-1- and paclitaxel-refractory, metastatic gastric cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	As no standard chemotherapy regimen has been established for advanced gastric cancer, this study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy that included paclitaxel and leucovorin (LV)-modulated infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in metastatic gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients received a three-hour infusion of 175 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on day 1. A bolus of 20 mg/m2 of LV was then administered, followed by a 24-h infusion of 1,000 mg/m2 of 5-FU on days 1 through 3.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The treatment cycle was re-peated every 3 weeks until disease progression. Response evaluation was performed according to the RECIST criteria, with toxicity determined by NCI-CTC (version 2. 0). A total of 66 patients, including 21 (31.
Non-randomized controlled trial	8%) with a history of prior chemotherapy, were enrolled. Fifteen (71. 4%) of the 21 patients with prior chemotherapy received prolonged infusional 5-FU.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In the 56 evaluable patients (37 in the chemotherapy-naïve group and 19 in the prior chemotherapy group), tumor responses according to prior exposure to chemotherapy were as follows: 17 (45. 9%) partial response (PR), 6 (16.
Non-randomized controlled trial	2%) stable disease (SD) and 14 (37. 8%) progressive disease (PD) in the chemotherapy-naïve group; 1 (7. 1%) complete response, 3 (15. 8%) PRs, 8 (42. 1%) SDs and 7 (36. 8%) PDs in the prior chemotherapy group.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The overall median response duration was 20 weeks (range, 8-61 weeks), with a median progression-free survival of 20 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI), 13. 4-26. 6 weeks] and 12 weeks (95% CI, 5. 7-18.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3 weeks) in the chemotherapy-naïve and prior chemotherapy groups, respectively. The median overall survival was 48 weeks (95% CI, 38-58 weeks) in the chemotherapy-naïve group and 28 weeks (95% CI, 22-34 weeks) in the prior chemotherapy group.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The most frequent grade III/IV toxicity was neutro-penia. Non-hematological toxicity of grade III/IV was rare.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Paclitaxel in combination with 5-FU/LV is clinically beneficial for patients with advanced gastric cancer and is a feasible salvage regimen for 5-FU-refractory gastric cancer patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Paclitaxel and leucovorin-modulated infusional 5-fluorouracil combination chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer
Case series	Objectives: We retrospectively assessed the combination of biweekly irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (LV) as salvage chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine (F), platinum (P), and taxane (T).
Case series	Methods: Between October 2003 and February 2006, all 131 patients with AGC were treated with irinotecan (150 mg/m(2) on day 1), along with either FOLFIRI-1 (ie, LV (20 mg/m(2) bolus) before 5-FU (1000 mg/m(2) continuous infusion over 6-hour) on days 1-2), or FOLFIRI-2 (ie, LV (20 mg/m(2) bolus) before 5-FU (400 mg/m(2) bolus) followed by 22-hour continuous infusion of 600 mg/m(2) on days 1-2), or FOLFIRI-3 (ie, 5-FU (400 mg/m(2) bolus) followed by 46-hour continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU and 100 mg/m(2) LV).
Case series	Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. Results: The median age of the patients was 52 years (range, 19-70 years). Patients received a median of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (range, 1-21 cycles). Of the 97 patients with measurable disease, 1 (1.
Case series	0%) achieved a complete response, and 11 (11. 3%) achieved partial responses, making the overall response rate 12. 3%. The median time to progression (TTP) was 2. 2 months (95% CI, 1. 9-2. 6 months) and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.
Case series	2 months (95% CI, 5. 6-6. 9 months). Good performance status (P = 0. 046), fewer metastatic sites (P < 0. 001), and longer time to progression of previous chemotherapy (P = 0. 006) were independent prognostic factors affecting OS.
Case series	OS was longer with the FOLFIRI-1 regimen but not with statistical significance (P = 0. 064). The treatments were generally well tolerated.
Case series	Conclusions: In actual clinical practice, biweekly irinotecan with 5-FU and LV had modest activity and tolerability in AGC patients previously treated with F, P, and T.
Case series	Salvage chemotherapy with biweekly irinotecan, plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with advanced gastric cancer previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and taxane
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy and toxicity of weekly irinotecan as second-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer after failure of cisplatin-based regimen.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Gastric cancer patients failing cisplatin-based chemotherapy received 125 mg/m(2) of irinotecan weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2-week rest, until disease progression. Results: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled into this study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The objective response was documented in seven of 35 patients with measurable lesion (response rate 20%, 95% CI: 6. 1-33. 9). Eight patients (22. 9%) had stable disease and overall tumor control rate was 42. 9%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The disease remained stable in both of two patients without measurable disease. At a median follow-up duration of 15. 8 months, median time to progression and overall survival were 2. 6 months (95% CI: 2. 4-2. 8) and 5. 2 months (95% CI: 3. 6-6.
Non-randomized controlled trial	7), respectively. Neutropenia and diarrhea were the main toxicities. Among 37 patients treated, grade 3/4 (G3/4) neutropenia occurred in 43. 2/24. 3% of patients, respectively, and was accompanied with fever in three patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Non-hematologic toxicities consisted mainly of delayed diarrhea (G3/4, 18. 9/0%) and nausea/vomiting (G3/4, 18. 9/0%). These toxicities were manageable and there was no treatment-related death.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: This weekly schedule of irinotecan was modestly active against cisplatin-refractory gastric cancer and relatively well-tolerated with appropriate dose modification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Weekly irinotecan in patients with metastatic gastric cancer failing cisplatin-based chemotherapy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objectives: A phase II study was carried out to assess the efficacy and toxicity of combination chemotherapy with irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) for the treatment of patients with metastatic or recurring gastric cancer previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Eligible patients were those who had metastatic gastric cancer previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen or had disease recurrence within 6 months of completing adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Participants received irinotecan (150 mg/m² on day 1) and leucovorin (LV; 20 mg/m² on days 1-2) followed by continuous infusion of 5-FU (1500 mg/m² on days 1-2), every 2 weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Between April 2006 and March 2008, 33 patients were enrolled in the study. FOLFIRI served as a second-line treatment in 27 patients, third-line treatment in 4 patients, and fourth-line treatment in 2 patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The patients had a median age of 60 years (range, 40-75) and underwent 132 cycles of chemotherapy, with a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-15) per patient. The response rate was 18. 2%, and the disease control rate was 36%. Median overall survival was 5.
Non-randomized controlled trial	1 months (95% confidence interval, 3. 74-6. 45), and median time to progression was 2. 3 months (95% confidence interval, 1. 81-2. 78). The major grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia (45. 4%).

Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Docetaxel (DCT), a semisynthetic taxoid, has demonstrated cytotoxic activity against gastric cancer in early phase II studies producing an overall response rate of 17-24%. The Gruppo Oncologico Italia Meridionale (G. O. I. M.
Non-randomized controlled trial	) started a confirmatory multicenter phase II trial to evaluate the clinical activity and toxicity of single agent TXT in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients who had failed a first-line chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Materials and methods: Thirty patients with advanced gastric carcinoma refractory to first-line ECF or PELF chemotherapy were treated with DCT administered at the dosage of 100 mg/mq given as a 1-hour i. v. infusion every three weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All patients received a premedication with dexamethasone 8 mg i. v. 12 hours and 1 hour before, and 12 hours after DCT administration. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was employed in case of febrile neutropenia as needed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The first evaluation of disease status was planned after three cycles. Results: We observed 5 partial responses without any complete response for an overall response rate of 17% (95% CI = 6-36%, intent-to-treat analysis).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Nine patients showed stable disease and 14 patients progressed. The duration of objective partial responses were 5, 6, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. The median overall survival was 6 months and the 1-year survival rate was 20. 6%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	No chemotherapy-related toxic death was observed. Haematological grade 3-4 side-effects were respectively: anemia (7%), leucopenia (7%) and neutropenia (18%); in 13 patients (45%) G-CSF was employed to avoid severe leukopenia.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: This multinstitutional single-step phase II study confirms that single-agent docetaxel is active in advanced gastric cancer progressing after first-line chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The most frequent toxicity is neutropenia, which may be managed by G-CSF and/or dose adjustments. Docetaxel is therefore worthy of further study in combination with other active drugs.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II study of paclitaxel in pretreated advanced gastric cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: This study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of weekly single-agent irinotecan in patients with metastatic disease relapsing after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients and methods: Fourteen patients were enrolled.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A total number of 29 cycles (one cycle consisted of CPT-11 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, qd 28) were applied. Irinotecan was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Where toxicity was less than WHO grade 3, the dose of irinotecan was escalated in 20 mg steps in subsequent cycles up to a maximum dose of 140 mg/m2. Patients were assessed for response according to WHO criteria every second cycle.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 13 evaluable patients, 2 achieved a partial response (PR) and 3 disease stabilisation (NC); progressive disease (PD) was noted in 8 patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Median time to progression was 2 months (range: 1-8 months) and median survival from start of study treatment was 5 months (range: 2-16 months). Grade 3 toxicity consisted of diarrhea (n=3), fever (n=1) and pain (n=1).

Non-randomized controlled trial	Irinotecan 160 mg m(-2) plus docetaxel 65 mg m(-2) once every 3 weeks led to severe myelosuppression in four patients, all of whom experienced neutropenic fever. After amendment of this regimen, 24 patients (male/female=18/6; median age=58.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5 years; ECOG performance status 0/1/2=9/11/4) with advanced oesophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma/epidermoid carcinoma=13/11) received irinotecan 55 mg m(-2) plus docetaxel 25 mg m(-2) on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Serious adverse events occurred in five patients, one with lethal outcome (pneumonia).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Haematological toxicity >or=3 degrees was rare, whereas nonhaematological toxicity >or=3 degrees was noted in nine out of 24 patients (asthenia in five patients, diarrhoea in three patients, nausea/emesis in two patients, constipation in one patient).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Median survival time was 26 (range 2-70) weeks. Response rate, assessed according to the WHO criteria, was 12. 5% (95% CI 2. 7-32. 4%); rate of disease stabilisation (partial remission and stable disease) was 33. 3% (95% CI 15. 6-55.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3%) with a median duration of 18. 5 (range 16-51) weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although the nonhaematological toxicity proved to be considerable, weekly irinotecan plus docetaxel is feasible and shows some activity in extensively pretreated patients with oesophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II trial of irinotecan plus docetaxel in cisplatin-pretreated relapsed or refractory oesophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Paclitaxel scheduled every 3 weeks has shown a response rate of approximately 20% for gastric cancer, with modest hematological toxicity.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Weekly administration of paclitaxel in patients with breast or ovarian cancer has shown equivalent efficacy and milder toxicity compared with an every-3 week schedule.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We investigated, retrospectively, the antitumor effects and toxicity profiles of weekly paclitaxel for patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer in clinical practice.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: In 38 patients who had metastatic or recurrent histologically confirmed gastric cancer and a history of one prior chemotherapy regimen, other than paclitaxel or docetaxel, paclitaxel (8 mg/m2) was administered weekly, three times every 4 weeks, with short-term premedication.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: All 38 patients had had prior chemotherapy that included 5-fluorouracil, the fluoropyrimidine anticancer drug S-1, or cisplatin. The median number of courses in the present regimen was 6 (range, 1-44+).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Dose intensity was 5mg/m2 per week, corresponding to 92% of the planned dose (6 mg/m2 per week).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The overall response rate was 24% (6/25) in measurable lesions, and pleural effusion and ascites disappeared in 2 of 7 patients (29%) and in 3 of 21 patients (14%), respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Median survival time was 151 days from the commencement of this treatment, with a median follow-up period of 260 days. Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and neutropenia were observed in 11 (29%) and 12 (32%) patients, respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Seven patients (18%) died within 30 days of the last administration of paclitaxel. Conclusion: Weekly paclitaxel seems to be active as second-line chemotherapy against metastatic and recurrent gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Further study is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Weekly paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent gastric cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Docetaxel has shown some activity in advanced gastric cancer. Recent phase I studies found low hematologic toxicity and a favourable toxicity profile when docetaxel was administered on a weekly schedule.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In this study, we explored the activity of weekly docetaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed first-line chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Materials and methods: Patients with stable or progressing disease after first-line chemotherapy received 36 mg/m2 weekly docetaxel. One cycle consisted of six administrations followed by a two-weeks rest, patients were re-evaluated at week eight.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The optimal two-stage design was adopted for early stopping of the trial if responses were one or less in 21 patients (< 20% response rate with alpha and beta error probabilities 0. 05 and 0. 010 respectively).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Twenty-one patients have been enrolled and they are fully evaluable for response and toxicity. One patient achieved partial response, 8 patients had stable disease and 12 patients progressed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival from the onset of salvage chemotherapy was 3. 5 months. Hematologic toxicity was observed in two patients who experienced grade III leukopenia.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Beginning from the third week of treatment, most of the patients (90%) showed grade II asthenia which resulted the commonest side-effect.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: This schedule of weekly docetaxel did not show significant activity in pretreated patients with advanced gastric cancer.

review	Gastric cancer remains one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. Unfortunately, most patients will present with advanced-stage disease, and will therefore need palliative chemotherapy.
review	Some chemotherapy regimens have been well established as first-line therapy, and have been shown to increase survival; however, almost all patients with metastatic gastric cancer will develop progressive disease after first-line therapy.
review	With the availability of several active chemotherapy drugs, many patients who retain a good performance status after the initial treatment remain good candidates for additional therapy; however, no standard approach for second-line therapy exists.
review	Many small, phase 2 trials have been done and the findings are variable. No data from randomised-controlled trials suggest a benefit of second-line chemotherapy compared with supportive care alone.
review	We review the published data concerning the use of chemotherapy in the second-line setting for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
review	Is there a role for second-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer?
meta analysis	The objective of this article was to review clinical trials that used antineoplastic second-line chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies in patients with esophageal cancer after first-line therapy.
meta analysis	Computerized (MEDLINE) and manual searches were performed to identify articles published on this topic between 1996 and 2011. Twenty-five published trials and four abstracts presented at scientific meetings were identified.
meta analysis	A total of 10 trials included only patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), four focused exclusively on adenocarcinoma (AC), the remaining 15 studies included both SCC and AC.
meta analysis	The majority of trials (17 of 29) used docetaxel in combination with platinum analogs, eight used single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and six evaluated targeted therapies.
meta analysis	The numbers of patients were relatively small, ranging from eight to 55 patients. The response rates were generally low (between 0% and 39%), with only two small studies reporting objective responses of 50% and 63%, respectively.
meta analysis	Time to progression ranged from 1. 4 to 6. 2 months, and the overall survival was disappointing at 4. 0 to 11. 4 months.
meta analysis	Approximately 40% of patients who experience progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy are able to undergo second-line treatment. On the basis of data published so far, no standard second-line therapy has emerged.
meta analysis	Future research will need to focus on individual therapy strategies such as genetic receptor mutations to increase the therapeutic outcome.
meta analysis	Esophageal cancer: a critical evaluation of systemic second-line therapy
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This phase III study compared treatment with weekly paclitaxel and biweekly irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to treatment with fluoropyrimidine plus platinum.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks) or irinotecan (150 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks).
randomized controlled trial	Primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, adverse events, and proportion of patients who received third-line chemotherapy.

randomized controlled trial	49; P =. 38). Median PFS was 3. 6 months in the paclitaxel group and 2. 3 months in the irinotecan group (HR, 1. 14; 95% CI, 0. 88 to 1. 49; P =. 33). Response rate was 20. 9% in the paclitaxel group and 13. 6% in the irinotecan group (P =. 24).
randomized controlled trial	Common grade 3 to 4 adverse events were neutropenia (paclitaxel group, 28. 7%; irinotecan group, 39. 1%), anemia (21. 3%; 30. 0%), and anorexia (7. 4%; 17. 3%). Treatment-related deaths occurred in two patients (1. 8%) in the irinotecan group.
randomized controlled trial	Third-line chemotherapy was administered in 97 patients (89. 8%) after paclitaxel treatment and in 80 patients (72. 1%) after irinotecan treatment (P =. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: No statistically significant difference was observed between paclitaxel and irinotecan for OS. Both are reasonable second-line treatment options for advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized, open-label, phase III study comparing irinotecan with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer without severe peritoneal metastasis after failure of prior combination chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine plus platinum: WJOG 4007 trial
randomized controlled trial	Lessons learned: Irinotecan could not be proven noninferior to paclitaxel as a second-line treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	The failure to demonstrate noninferiority may have been a result of insufficient patient enrollment. Both agents were tolerable but showed different toxicity profiles.
randomized controlled trial	Background: This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus irinotecan in patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer (MRGC) who had experienced disease progression following first-line chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients were randomized to receive either paclitaxel (70 mg/m2; days 1, 8, 15, every 4 weeks) or irinotecan (150 mg/m2 every other week). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
randomized controlled trial	Results: This study was stopped early due to low accrual rate. A total of 112 patients were enrolled; 54 were allocated to paclitaxel and 58 to irinotecan. Median PFS for the paclitaxel and irinotecan groups was 3. 5 and 2.
randomized controlled trial	1 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 86-1. 88; p =. 234). Noninferiority of irinotecan to paclitaxel was not proved because the upper boundary of the 95% CI (1.
randomized controlled trial	88) exceeded the predefined upper margin of noninferiority (1. 32). Median overall survival (OS) was 8. 6 months in the paclitaxel group and 7. 0 months in the irinotecan group (HR, 1. 39; 95% CI, 0. 91-2. 11; p =. 126).
randomized controlled trial	Among toxicities greater than or equal to grade 3, neutropenia (11. 5%) was the most common, followed by peripheral neuropathy (7. 7%) in the paclitaxel group, and neutropenia (34. 5%) followed by nausea, vomiting, and anemia (8.
randomized controlled trial	6%, respectively) in the irinotecan group. Conclusion: Although paclitaxel showed numerically longer PFS and OS compared with irinotecan, this was statistically insignificant.
randomized controlled trial	Both irinotecan and paclitaxel are valid second-line treatment options in MRGC.
randomized controlled trial	A Phase III Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel Versus Irinotecan in Patients with Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric Cancer Who Failed in First-line Therapy (KCSG ST10-01)
randomized controlled trial	Aim: The optimal second-line regimen for treating advanced gastric cancer (AGC) remains unclear.
randomized controlled trial	While irinotecan (CPT-11) plus cisplatin (CDDP) combination therapy and CPT-11 monotherapy have been explored in the second-line setting, the superiority of second-line platinum-based therapies for AGC patients initially treated with S-1 monotherapy has not yet been evaluated; therefore, we aimed to examine the survival benefit of CPT-11/CDDP combination over CPT-11 monotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: AGC patients showing progression after S-1 monotherapy for advanced cancer or recurrence within 6 months after completion of S-1 adjuvant therapy were randomly allocated to CPT-11/CDDP (CPT-11, 60 mg/m(2); CDDP, 30 mg/m(2), q2w) or CPT-11 (150 mg/m(2), q2w).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Sixty-eight advanced and 95 recurrent cases were evaluated. The median overall survivals were 13. 9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10. 8-17. 6) and 12. 7 (95% CI: 10. 3-17. 2) months for CPT-11/CDDP and CPT-11, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.
randomized controlled trial	834; 95% CI: 0. 596-1. 167, P = 0. 288). No significant differences were observed in the secondary end-points, including progression-free survival (4. 6 [95% CI: 3. 4-5. 9] versus 4. 1 [95% CI: 3. 3-4. 9]months) and response rate (16. 9% [95% CI: 8.
randomized controlled trial	8-28. 3] versus 15. 4% [95% CI: 7. 6-26. 5]). The incidences of grade 3-4 anaemia (16% versus 4%) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (5% versus 0%) were higher for CPT-11/CDDP than for CPT-11.
randomized controlled trial	Exploratory subgroup analysis revealed that CPT-11/CDDP was significantly more effective for intestinal-type AGC, compared with CPT-11 (overall survival: 15. 8 versus 14. 0 months; P = 0. 019).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: No survival benefit was observed upon adding CDDP to CPT-11 after S-1 monotherapy failure.
randomized controlled trial	Randomised phase III trial of second-line irinotecan plus cisplatin versus irinotecan alone in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to S-1 monotherapy: TRICS trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Weekly administration of solvent-based paclitaxel is one of the standard second-line chemotherapy regimens for advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) was developed to improve the solubility of paclitaxel and does not need premedication to avoid infusion-related reactions associated with solvent-based paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	Additionally, higher doses of nab-paclitaxel can be administered over a shorter infusion time and at higher drug concentrations compared with solvent-based paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel versus solvent-based paclitaxel in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial at 72 institutions in Japan.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 20 years or older with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma refractory to a fluoropyrimidine-containing first-line chemotherapy regimen, with progressive disease or a relapse fewer than 24 weeks after the final dose of adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive intravenous nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m2) every 3 weeks (on day 1 of a 21-day cycle), weekly nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2, on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle), or weekly solvent-based paclitaxel (80 mg/m2, on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle).
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was done with the minimisation method, with stratification for previous use of docetaxel, presence of peritoneal metastases, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival in the full analysis set, which included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug, with a non-inferiority margin of 1·25 for the hazard ratio.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center Clinical Trial, number JapicCTI-132059, and has been completed.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between March 13, 2013, and May 14, 2015, 741 patients were randomly assigned to nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks (n=247), weekly nab-paclitaxel (n=246), or weekly solvent-based paclitaxel (n=248).
randomized controlled trial	Median follow-up for overall survival was 9·99 months (IQR 6·05-15·05).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 10·3 months (95% CI 8·7-11·4) in the group that received in the nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks, 11·1 months (9·9-13·0) in the weekly nab-paclitaxel group, and 10·9 months (9·4-11·8) in the weekly solvent-based paclitaxel group.
randomized controlled trial	Weekly nab-paclitaxel was non-inferior to weekly solvent-based paclitaxel (hazard ratio 0·97, 97·5% CI 0·76-1·23; non-inferiority one-sided p=0·0085), whereas nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks was not non-inferior to solvent-based paclitaxel (1·06, 95% CI 0·87-1·31; non-inferiority one-sided p=0·062).
randomized controlled trial	The main grade 3 or worse adverse drug reactions were neutropenia (158 [65%] of 244 patients in the group that received nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks vs 99 [41%] of 241 patients in the weekly nab-paclitaxel group vs 71 [29%] of 243 patients in the weekly solvent-based paclitaxel group), peripheral sensory neuropathy (49 [20%] vs six [2%] vs six [2%]), and febrile neutropenia (30 [12%] vs seven [3%] vs two [1%]).
randomized controlled trial	Hypersensitivity reactions were less frequent with nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks (two [1%] patients) and weekly nab-paclitaxel (three [1%] patients) than with weekly solvent-based paclitaxel (13 [5%] patients).
randomized controlled trial	Four treatment-related deaths were reported overall (pneumonia in one patient in the group that received nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks, febrile neutropenia/pneumonia in one patient, and septic shock in one patient in the weekly nab-paclitaxel group, and respiratory disease/interstitial lung disease in one patient in the weekly solvent-based paclitaxel group).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: As the trial showed that weekly nab-paclitaxel was non-inferior to weekly solvent-based paclitaxel in terms of overall survival, the advantages of the nab-paclitaxel formulation make it a potential regimen for second-line treatment of gastric cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Nab-paclitaxel versus solvent-based paclitaxel in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (ABSOLUTE): an open-label, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: There is no standard chemotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) refractory to first-line fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	We therefore performed a randomized, selection-design phase II trial to compare docetaxel (DTX) and paclitaxel (PTX) in this setting.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either DTX (70 mg/m2 on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) or PTX (100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36 of each 49-day cycle).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end-point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end-points included progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), response rate (RR) and safety.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Seventy-eight eligible patients (N = 39 in each group) were included for efficacy analysis. OS was significantly longer in the PTX group than in the DTX group (median, 8. 8 versus 7. 3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 62; P = 0. 047).
randomized controlled trial	A significant benefit of PTX over DTX was also apparent in PFS (median, 4. 4 versus 2. 1 months; HR, 0. 49; P = 0. 002) and TTF (median, 3. 8 versus 2. 1 months; HR, 0. 45; P < 0. 001). RR (25. 6% versus 7. 7%, P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	065) were higher in the PTX group than in the DTX group. Compared to the PTX group, neutropenia (28% versus 80%) and leukopenia (28% versus 76%) of grade ≥3 as well as febrile neutropenia (0% vs. 46%, P < 0.
randomized controlled trial	0001) occurred more frequently in the DTX group. Conclusion: PTX showed a significantly better efficacy as well as a more manageable toxicity compared with DTX. Clinical trial registration: UMIN000007940.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized phase II study of docetaxel versus paclitaxel in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma refractory to fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy: OGSG1201
Case series	The genomes of cancers deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic mutations.
Case series	In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).
Case series	We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types.
Case series	Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached.
Case series	Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor.
Case series	These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.
Case series	Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
Case series	This study investigated whether MSI status can be used as a prognostic biomarker and whether it is helpful for predicting which patients will benefit from 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy.
Case series	Between 2005 and 2008, an MSI status examination was performed in 1,990 gastric cancer patients who had undergone curative gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma.
Case series	MSI was analyzed by PCR amplification with fluorescent dye-labeled primers of mononucleotide markers (BAT25 and BAT26) and dinucleotide markers (D5S346, D2S123 and D17S250) specific to the microsatellite loci.
Case series	Patients with MSI-H tumors accounted for 8. 5% (n = 170) of the total study population.
Case series	They tended to be older and female and to have distal tumor location, lower tumor stage, intestinal type of Lauren classification and differentiated histological type.
Case series	The disease-free survival curves showed no significant differences between MSS/MSI-L and MSI-H patients at each stage of I, II, III and IV.
Case series	In gastric cancer patients with stage II and III, 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy showed better disease-free survival in the MSS/MSI-L group, but showed no benefits in the MSI-H group.
Case series	By multivariate analysis, patients with MSS/MSI-L tumors benefited from 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of tumor disease-free survival. MSI status in gastric cancer is not itself a prognostic indicator.
Case series	However, it appears to be a possible guidance for the use of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in stage II and III gastric cancers after R0 resection.
Case series	Microsatellite instability in sporadic gastric cancer: its prognostic role and guidance for 5-FU based chemotherapy after R0 resection
Case series	Background and aim: A subset of gastric cancers showed high microsatellite instability (MSI-H).
Case series	The reported clinicopathological features of MSI-H gastric cancers are heterogeneous, and specific factors associated with prognosis have not been identified.
Case series	Methods: We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors in a large series (161 cases) of MSI-H gastric cancers, and compared the results to 315 cases of microsatellite-stable or low microsatellite-instable gastric cancers.
Case series	Results: The frequency of MSI-H gastric cancers was 9% (161/1786).
Case series	MSI-H gastric cancers have distinct clinicopathological features, including female sex, older age, antral location, well-to-moderate differentiation, intestinal-type Lauren classification, expanding-type Ming classification, a non-signet-ring cell component, the presence of a mucinous component, a moderate-to-severe lymphoid stromal reaction, and a lower tumor stage.
Case series	The MSI-H phenotype was associated with better prognosis (P = 0. 044), and male sex (P = 0. 035, hazard ratios [HR]: 0. 23), intestinal-/mixed-type Lauren classification (P < 0. 001, HR: 0. 09) and lower tumor stages (1 and 2, P = 0. 001, HR: 0.
Case series	08) were independently-favorable prognostic factors. Conclusions: With unique clinicopathological features, intestinal-type MSI-H gastric cancers are associated with good prognosis and can be classified as a different subset of gastric cancers.
Case series	High microsatellite instability predicts good prognosis in intestinal-type gastric cancers
Case series	Background: The assessment of microsatellite instability (MSI) is not included yet in the routine evaluation of patients with gastric cancer, as controversial data exist regarding its prognostic value.
Case series	Methods: We determined the clinical significance of MSI in 510 sporadic gastric cancers, using the mononucleotide markers BAT25 and BAT26. The results were compared with the immunohistochemical expression of the mismatch repair proteins Mlh1 and Msh2.
Case series	Results: MSI was present in 83 (16%) cancers and correlated with better survival (P <. 001). Multivariate analysis showed that the MSI phenotype was an independent factor (P =. 005) and added prognostic information to TNM stage, location, and age.
Case series	The relative risk of death for MSI cancer patients was 0. 6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 4-0. 8). Moreover, when grouped according to stage, only stage II cancers showed a significant effect of MSI status on survival (P =. 011; hazard ratio = 0.
Case series	3; 95% CI, 0. 1-0. 8). MSI also correlated with older age (P =. 002), female gender (P <. 001), intestinal histotype (P =. 011), lower T stage (P =. 018), and less lymph node involvement (P <. 001).
Case series	Finally, comparison of the results of immunohistochemical expression of the mismatch repair proteins Mlh1 and Msh2 with microsatellite analysis showed concordant results in 95% of neoplasms, with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 98%.
Case series	Conclusions: Microsatellite analysis of gastric cancer has clinical utility in determination of prognosis, but should be determined in only stage II neoplasms in a routine clinical setting.
Case series	Immunohistochemistry may be considered sufficient, although microsatellite analysis is preferable.
Case series	Microsatellite instability in gastric cancer is associated with better prognosis in only stage II cancers
Case series	Microsatellite instable gastric cancer (MSI-GC) is a specific molecular subtype of GC.
Case series	We studied the phenotypes, genotypes, and clinicopathologic characteristics of MSI-GC in a white GC cohort and compared our findings with an extended literature review. The study cohort consisted of 482 patients.
Case series	Specimens were available from 452 cases and were used for immunostaining (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6) and molecular biological analyses (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, NR-27; Epstein-Barr virus in situ hybridization). Thirty-four (7. 5%) GCs were MSI.
Case series	Loss of MLH1 and/or PMS2 was found in 30 (88%) MSI-GC, 3 (9%) showed loss of MSH2 and/or MSH6. One (3%) MSI-GC was identified only by molecular biological testing.
Case series	A single case was heterogeneous and contained microsatellite-stable and instable tumor areas. Twenty-one (62%) MSI-GCs showed unusual histologic features. MSI-GC was not found in diffuse-type or Epstein-Barr virus-positive GC.
Case series	MSI-GC was significantly more prevalent in elderly patients, distal stomach, and was associated with a significantly lower number of lymph node metastases and a significantly better overall and tumor-specific survival.
Case series	MSI-GC constitutes a small but relevant subgroup of GC with distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. Our literature review illustrates the shortcomings of missing standardized testing algorithms with prevalences of MSI-GC ranging from 0% to 44. 5%.
Case series	Future studies should test the hypothesis that patients with MSI-GCs may not need adjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy. However, this will require a standardized, quality-controlled diagnostic algorithm of MSI for GC.
Case series	Clinicopathologic Characteristics of Microsatellite Instable Gastric Carcinomas Revisited: Urgent Need for Standardization
meta analysis	Purpose: In the CLASSIC and MAGIC trials, microsatellite instability (MSI)-high status was a favorable prognostic and potential negative predictive factor for neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy in resectable gastric cancer (GC).
meta analysis	Given the low prevalence of MSI-high status in GC and its association with other positive prognostic variables, large data sets are needed to draw robust evidence of its prognostic/predictive value.
meta analysis	Patients and methods: We performed a multinational, individual-patient-data meta-analysis of the prognostic/predictive role of MSI in patients with resectable GC enrolled in the MAGIC, CLASSIC, ARTIST, and ITACA-S trials.
meta analysis	Prognostic analyses used multivariable Cox models (MVM).
meta analysis	The predictive role of MSI was assessed both in an all-comer population and in MAGIC and CLASSIC trials by MVM testing of the interaction of treatment (chemotherapy plus surgery v surgery) with MSI.
meta analysis	Results: MSI status was available for 1,556 patients: 121 (7. 8%) had MSI-high status; 576 were European, and 980 were Asian. In MSI-high versus MSI-low/microsatellite stable (MSS) comparisons, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 71.
meta analysis	8% (95% CI, 63. 8% to 80. 7%) versus 52. 3% (95% CI, 49. 7% to 55. 1%); the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 77. 5% (95% CI, 70. 0% to 85. 8%) versus 59. 3% (95% CI, 56. 6% to 62. 1%). In MVM, MSI was associated with longer DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.
meta analysis	88; 95% CI, 1. 28 to 2. 76; P <. 001) and OS (HR, 1. 78; 95% CI, 1. 17 to 2. 73; P =. 008), as were pT, pN, ethnicity, and treatment.
meta analysis	Patients with MSI-low/MSS GC benefitted from chemotherapy plus surgery: the 5-year DFS compared with surgery only was 57% versus 41% (HR, 0. 65; 95% CI, 0. 53 to 0. 79), and the 5-year OS was 62% versus 53% (HR, 0. 75; 95% CI, 0. 60 to 0. 94).
meta analysis	Conversely, those with MSI-high GC did not: the 5-year DFS was 70% versus 77% (HR, 1. 27; 95% CI, 0. 53 to 3. 04), and the 5-year OS was 75% versus 83% (HR, 1. 50; 95% CI, 0. 55 to 4. 12).
meta analysis	Conclusion: In patients with resectable primary GC, MSI is a robust prognostic marker that should be adopted as a stratification factor by clinical trials.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy omission and/or immune checkpoint blockade should be investigated prospectively in MSI-high GCs according to clinically and pathologically defined risk of relapse.
meta analysis	Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of the Value of Microsatellite Instability As a Biomarker in Gastric Cancer
Case series	Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been reported in various tumors, with colon cancer as the prototype. However, little is known about MSI in Barrett esophagus (BE)-associated adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathologic and molecular features of BE-associated adenocarcinomas with and without MSI.
Case series	The study cohort consisted of 76 patients with BE-associated adenocarcinomas (66 male, 10 female), with a mean age of 65. 1 years.
Case series	Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and CD3 and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA were performed. MLH1 and PMS2 expression was lost by IHC in 5 cases (6.
Case series	6%); of these, 5 showed high-level MSI (MSI-H) by polymerase chain reaction assay, and 4 showed hMLH1 promoter methylation.
Case series	Histologically, tumors with MSI-H were heterogenous and included conventional adenocarcinomas with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (n=1), medullary carcinoma (n=2), signet ring cells (n=1), and signet ring cell and mucinous components (n=1).
Case series	Compared with tumors negative for MSI by IHC, BE-associated adenocarcinomas with MSI-H were associated with older patient age (P=0. 0060), lymphovascular invasion (P=0. 027), and significantly larger numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P<0.
Case series	0001). However, there was no statistical difference in overall survival between the 2 groups (P=0. 285).
Case series	In conclusion, MSI-H is uncommon in BE-associated adenocarcinomas, but is associated with clinicopathologic features fairly similar to sporadic microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers.
Case series	Given the growing evidence that indicates lack of benefits from adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil in the colonic counterpart, it may be important to identify MSI-H in BE-associated adenocarcinomas.
Case series	Clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of microsatellite unstable Barrett Esophagus-associated adenocarcinoma
Case series	The malignant transformation that characterizes the development of Barrett esophagus-associated adenocarcinomas is a multi-step process in which genetic alterations in various tumor-associated genes accumulate.
Case series	Defective mismatch repair (MMR) is the cause of microsatellite instability (MSI) pathway that characterizes a subset of gastrointestinal tumors and is specifically associated with tumor development within the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome.
Case series	The few studies that have assessed MMR defects in Barrett-associated adenocarcinomas have reached different results.
Case series	We therefore assessed the expression of the MMR proteins MLH1 and MSH2 in a series of 59 Barrett adenocarcinomas and found a loss of MMR protein immunostaining in 2/59 (3%) tumors; one tumor showed a loss of MSH2 expression, the other tumor showed a loss of MLH1, and both tumors displayed an MSI-high phenotype.
Case series	Our findings suggest that only a small subset of Barrett adenocarcinomas develop because of defective MMR, but demonstrate that MLH1 and MSH2 are the primary targets for defective MMR also in this tumor type.
Case series	Defective mismatch-repair as a minor tumorigenic pathway in Barrett esophagus-associated adenocarcinoma
Case series	Purpose: Microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair (MMR) status is increasingly important in the management of patients with cancer to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Case series	We determined MSI status from large-panel clinical targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data across various solid cancer types.
Case series	Methods: The MSI statuses of 12,288 advanced solid cancers consecutively sequenced with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets clinical NGS assay were inferred by using MSIsensor, a program that reports the percentage of unstable microsatellites as a score.
Case series	Cutoff score determination and sensitivity/specificity were based on MSI polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and MMR immunohistochemistry.
Case series	Results: By using an MSIsensor score ≥ 10 to define MSI high (MSI-H), 83 (8%) of 996 colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 42 (16%) of 260 uterine endometrioid cancers (UECs) were MSI-H.
Case series	Validation against MSI PCR and/or MMR immunohistochemistry performed for 138 (24 MSI-H, 114 microsatellite stable [MSS]) CRCs, and 40 (15 MSI-H, 25 MSS) UECs showed a concordance of 99. 4%.
Case series	MSIsensor also identified 68 MSI-H/MMR-deficient (MMR-D) non-CRC/UECs. Of 9,591 non-CRC/UEC tumors with MSS MSIsensor status, 456 (4. 8%) had slightly elevated scores(≥3 and <10) of which 96.
Case series	6% with available material were confirmed to be MSS by MSI PCR. MSI-H was also detected and confirmed in three non-CRC/UECs with low exonic mutation burden (< 20).
Case series	MSIsensor correctly scored all 15 polymerase ε ultra-mutated cancers as negative for MSI. Conclusion: MSI status can be reliably inferred by MSIsensor from large-panel targeted NGS data.
Case series	Concurrent MSI testing by NGS is resource efficient, is potentially more sensitive for MMR-D than MSI PCR, and allows identification of MSI-H across various cancers not typically screened, as highlighted by the finding that 35% (68 of 193) of all MSI-H tumors were non-CRC/ UEC.
Case series	Reliable Pan-Cancer Microsatellite Instability Assessment by Using Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Data
meta analysis	Importance: Immunotherapy has been associated with improved outcomes among patients who have received previous treatment for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors.
meta analysis	Objective: To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab therapy vs chemotherapy among patients with MSI-H advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer regardless of the line of therapy in which it was received.
meta analysis	Design, setting, and participants: This post hoc analysis of the phase 2 KEYNOTE-059 (third-line treatment or higher) single-arm trial and the phase 3 KEYNOTE-061 (second-line treatment) and KEYNOTE-062 (first-line treatment) randomized trials included patients with advanced G/GEJ cancer from 52 sites in 16 countries enrolled in KEYNOTE-059, 148 sites in 30 countries enrolled in KEYNOTE-061, and 200 sites in 29 countries enrolled in KEYNOTE-062.
meta analysis	Patients were enrolled from March 2, 2015, to March 26, 2016, in KEYNOTE-059; from June 4, 2015, to July 26, 2016, in KEYNOTE-061; and from September 18, 2015, to May 26, 2017, in KEYNOTE-062, with data cutoff dates of August 8, 2018; October 26, 2017; and March 26, 2019; respectively.
meta analysis	Interventions: Pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-059, pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy (paclitaxel) in KEYNOTE-061, and pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine), or chemotherapy alone in KEYNOTE-062.
meta analysis	Main outcomes and measures: Response was assessed centrally using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1. 1; MSI-H status was determined centrally by polymerase chain reaction testing.
meta analysis	Results: At data cutoff, 7 of 174 patients (4. 0%) in KEYNOTE-059, 27 of 514 patients (5. 3%) in KEYNOTE-061, and 50 of 682 patients (7. 3%) in KEYNOTE-062 had MSI-H tumors.
meta analysis	Among those with MSI-H tumors, the median overall survival was not reached (NR) for pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-061, and KEYNOTE-062 or for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-062.
meta analysis	The median progression-free survival (PFS) for pembrolizumab was NR (95% CI, 1. 1 months to NR) in KEYNOTE-059 and 17. 8 months (95% CI, 2. 7 months to NR) in KEYNOTE-061 (vs 3. 5 months [95% CI, 2. 0-9. 8 months] for chemotherapy).
meta analysis	In KEYNOTE-062, the median PFS was 11. 2 months (95% CI, 1. 5 months to NR) for pembrolizumab, NR (95% CI, 3. 6 months to NR) for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and 6. 6 months (95% CI, 4. 4-8. 3 months) for chemotherapy.
meta analysis	The objective response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab was 57. 1% in KEYNOTE-059 and 46. 7% (vs 16. 7% for chemotherapy) in KEYNOTE-061. In KEYNOTE-062, the ORR was 57. 1% for pembrolizumab , 64. 7% for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and 36.
meta analysis	8% for chemotherapy. Conclusions and relevance: Findings from this study indicate that MSI-H status may be a biomarker for pembrolizumab therapy among patients with advanced G/GEJ cancer regardless of the line of therapy in which it was received.

meta analysis	Assessment of Pembrolizumab Therapy for the Treatment of Microsatellite Instability-High Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer Among Patients in the KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-061, and KEYNOTE-062 Clinical Trials
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Genomes of tumors that are deficient in DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) have high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and harbor hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations that encode potential neoantigens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Such tumors are therefore likely to be immunogenic, triggering upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins. Pembrolizumab, an anti‒programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody, has antitumor activity against MSI-H/dMMR cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We report data from the phase II KEYNOTE-158 study of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated, advanced noncolorectal MSI-H/dMMR cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligible patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed MSI-H/dMMR advanced noncolorectal cancer who experienced failure with prior therapy received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Radiologic imaging was performed every 9 weeks for the first year of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	1, as assessed by independent central radiologic review. Results: Among 233 enrolled patients, 27 tumor types were represented, with endometrial, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancers being the most common. Median follow up was 13.
Non-randomized controlled trial	4 months. Objective response rate was 34. 3% (95% CI, 28. 3% to 40. 8%). Median progression-free survival was 4. 1 months (95% CI, 2. 4 to 4. 9 months) and median overall survival was 23. 5 months (95% CI, 13. 5 months to not reached).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 151 patients (64. 8%). Thirty-four patients (14. 6%) had grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events. Grade 5 pneumonia occurred in one patient; there were no other treatment-related fatal adverse events.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the clinical benefit of anti-programmed death-1 therapy with pembrolizumab among patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR noncolorectal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Toxicity was consistent with previous experience of pembrolizumab monotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Patients With Noncolorectal High Microsatellite Instability/Mismatch Repair-Deficient Cancer: Results From the Phase II KEYNOTE-158 Study
Case series	Background: High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an emerging biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors and has been shown to be more significantly associated with response to PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy than PD-1 or PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Case series	The distribution of TMB and the subset of patients with high TMB has not been well characterized in the majority of cancer types.
Case series	Methods: In this study, we compare TMB measured by a targeted comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to TMB measured by exome sequencing and simulate the expected variance in TMB when sequencing less than the whole exome.
Case series	We then describe the distribution of TMB across a diverse cohort of 100,000 cancer cases and test for association between somatic alterations and TMB in over 100 tumor types.
Case series	Results: We demonstrate that measurements of TMB from comprehensive genomic profiling are strongly reflective of measurements from whole exome sequencing and model that below 0. 5 Mb the variance in measurement increases significantly.
Case series	We find that a subset of patients exhibits high TMB across almost all types of cancer, including many rare tumor types, and characterize the relationship between high TMB and microsatellite instability status.
Case series	We find that TMB increases significantly with age, showing a 2. 4-fold difference between age 10 and age 90 years. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of TMB and identify genes and mutations associated with TMB level.
Case series	We identify a cluster of somatic mutations in the promoter of the gene PMS2, which occur in 10% of skin cancers and are highly associated with increased TMB. Conclusions: These results show that a CGP assay targeting ~1.
Case series	1 Mb of coding genome can accurately assess TMB compared with sequencing the whole exome. Using this method, we find that many disease types have a substantial portion of patients with high TMB who might benefit from immunotherapy.
Case series	Finally, we identify novel, recurrent promoter mutations in PMS2, which may be another example of regulatory mutations contributing to tumorigenesis.
Case series	Analysis of 100,000 human cancer genomes reveals the landscape of tumor mutational burden
Case series	Background: Alterations in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway confer sensitivity to certain chemotherapies, radiation, and other DNA damage repair targeted therapies.
Case series	BRCA1/2 are the most well-studied DDR genes, but recurrent alterations are described in other DDR pathway members across cancers.
Case series	Deleterious DDR alterations may sensitize tumor cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition, but there are also increasing data suggesting that there may also be synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Case series	The relevance of DDR defects in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is understudied.
Case series	We sought to characterize DDR-defective GI malignancies and to explore genomic context and tumor mutational burden (TMB) to provide a platform for future rational investigations.
Case series	Materials and methods: Tumor samples from 17,486 unique patients with advanced colorectal, gastroesophageal, or small bowel carcinomas were assayed using hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling including sequencing of 10 predefined DDR genes: ARID1A, ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, PALB2, and RAD51.
Case series	TMB (mutations per megabase [mut/Mb]) was calculated from up to 1. 14 Mb of sequenced DNA. Clinicopathologic features were extracted and descriptive statistics were used to explore genomic relationships among identified subgroups.
Case series	Results: DDR alterations were found in 17% of cases: gastric adenocarcinoma 475/1,750 (27%), small bowel adenocarcinoma 148/666 (22%), esophageal adenocarcinoma 467/2,501 (19%), and colorectal cancer 1,824/12,569 (15%). ARID1A (9. 2%) and ATM (4.
Case series	7%) were the most commonly altered DDR genes in this series, followed by BRCA2 (2. 3%), BRCA1 (1. 1%), CHEK2 (1. 0%), ATR (0. 8%), CDK12 (0. 7%), PALB2 (0. 6%), CHEK1 (0. 1%) and RAD51 (0. 1%).
Case series	More than one DDR gene alteration was found in 24% of cases. High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and high TMB (TMB-H, ≥20 mut/Mb) were found in 19% and 21% of DDR-altered cases, respectively. Of DDR-altered/TMB-H cases, 87% were also MSI-H.
Case series	However, even in the microsatellite stable (MSS)/DDR-wild-type (WT) versus MSS/DDR-altered, TMB-high was seen more frequently (0. 4% vs. 3. 3%, P <. 00001. ) Median TMB was 5. 4 mut/Mb in the MSS/DDR-altered subset versus 3.
Case series	8 mut/Mb in the MSS/DDR-WT subset (P ≤. 00001), and ATR alterations were enriched in the MSS/TMB-high cases.
Case series	Conclusion: This is the largest study to examine selected DDR defects in tubular GI cancers and confirms that DDR defects are relatively common and that there is an association between the selected DDR defects and a high TMB in more than 20% of cases.
Case series	Microsatellite stable DDR-defective tumors with elevated TMB warrant further exploration.
Case series	Implications for practice: Deleterious DNA damage response (DDR) alterations may sensitize tumor cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition, but also potentially to immune checkpoint inhibitors, owing to accumulation of mutations in DDR-defective tumors.
Case series	The relevance of DDR defects in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is understudied. This article characterizes DDR-defective GI malignancies and explores genomic context and tumor mutational burden to provide a platform for future rational investigations.
Case series	Analysis of DNA Damage Response Gene Alterations and Tumor Mutational Burden Across 17,486 Tubular Gastrointestinal Carcinomas: Implications for Therapy
meta analysis	Importance: PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene expression profiling (GEP), and multiplex immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (mIHC/IF) assays have been used to assess pretreatment tumor tissue to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies.
meta analysis	However, the relative diagnostic performance of these modalities has yet to be established. Objective: To compare studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PD-L1 IHC, TMB, GEP, and mIHC/IF in predicting response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
meta analysis	Evidence review: A search of PubMed (from inception to June 2018) and 2013 to 2018 annual meeting abstracts from the American Association for Cancer Research, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer was conducted to identify studies that examined the use of PD-L1 IHC, TMB, GEP, and mIHC/IF assays to determine objective response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
meta analysis	For PD-L1 IHC, only clinical trials that resulted in US Food and Drug Administration approval of indications for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 were included. Studies combining more than 1 modality were also included.
meta analysis	Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed. Two reviewers independently extracted the clinical outcomes and test results for each individual study.
meta analysis	Main outcomes and measures: Summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves; their associated area under the curve (AUC); and pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) for each assay modality.
meta analysis	Results: Tumor specimens representing over 10 different solid tumor types in 8135 patients were assayed, and the results were correlated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 response.
meta analysis	When each modality was evaluated with sROC curves, mIHC/IF had a significantly higher AUC (0. 79) compared with PD-L1 IHC (AUC, 0. 65, P <. 001), GEP (AUC, 0. 65, P =. 003), and TMB (AUC, 0. 69, P =. 049).
meta analysis	When multiple different modalities were combined such as PD-L1 IHC and/or GEP + TMB, the AUC drew nearer to that of mIHC/IF (0. 74). All modalities demonstrated comparable NPV and LR-, whereas mIHC/IF demonstrated higher PPV (0. 63) and LR+ (2.
meta analysis	86) than the other approaches. Conclusions and relevance: In this meta-analysis, tumor mutational burden, PD-L1 IHC, and GEP demonstrated comparable AUCs in predicting response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.
meta analysis	Multiplex immunohistochemistry/IF and multimodality biomarker strategies appear to be associated with improved performance over PD-L1 IHC, TMB, or GEP alone.
meta analysis	Further studies with mIHC/IF and composite approaches with a larger number of patients will be required to confirm these findings.
meta analysis	Additional study is also required to determine the most predictive analyte combinations and to determine whether biomarker modality performance varies by tumor type.
meta analysis	Comparison of Biomarker Modalities for Predicting Response to PD-1/PD-L1 Checkpoint Blockade: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Expression of PD-L1 has been shown to be upregulated in some patients with gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	As part of the phase 1b KEYNOTE-012 study, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: This study was a multicentre, open-label, phase 1b trial done at 13 cancer research centres in the USA, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We enrolled patients with PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab at 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for 24 months or until progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Response was assessed every 8 weeks in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1. 1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The primary objectives were safety in patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and the proportion of patients achieving overall responses in patients who received at least one pembrolizumab dose and who either had a post-baseline scan or who discontinued therapy because of clinical disease progression or a treatment-related adverse event before the first post-baseline scan.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01848834, and is ongoing but no longer enrolling patients. Findings: From Oct 23, 2013, to May 5, 2014, 39 patients were enrolled. 36 were evaluable for response by central assessment.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Eight (22%, 95% CI 10-39) patients were judged to have had an overall response at central review; all responses were partial. All 39 patients were included in the safety analyses.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Five (13%) patients had a total of six grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, consisting of two cases of grade 3 fatigue, one case each of grade 3 pemphigoid, grade 3 hypothyroidism, and grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy, and one case of grade 4 pneumonitis.
Non-randomized controlled trial	No treatment-related deaths occurred.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: In this population of patients with recurrent or metastatic PD-L1-positive gastric cancer, pembrolizumab had a manageable toxicity profile and promising antitumour activity, warranting further study in phase 2 and 3 trials.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab for patients with PD-L1-positive advanced gastric cancer (KEYNOTE-012): a multicentre, open-label, phase 1b trial
Case series	Purpose The anti-programmed death-1 antibody pembrolizumab was evaluated in KEYNOTE-028, a multicohort, phase IB study of patients with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-positive advanced solid tumors.
Case series	Results from the esophageal carcinoma cohort are reported herein.
Case series	Patients and Methods Eligible patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction in whom standard therapy failed and who had PD-L1-positive tumors received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Case series	Response was assessed every 8 weeks up to 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. Primary end points were safety and overall response rate, determined by investigator review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1. 1).
Case series	Results Among 83 patients with esophageal carcinoma and samples evaluable for PD-L1 expression, 37 (45%) had PD-L1-positive tumors, and 23 were enrolled.
Case series	Median age was 65 years; 78% had squamous histology; and 87% received ≥ two prior therapies for advanced/metastatic disease. As of the data cutoff (February 20, 2017), median follow-up was 7 months (range, 1 to 33 months).
Case series	Nine patients (39%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, most commonly decreased appetite, decreased lymphocyte count, generalized rash, and rash (two patients [9%] each). No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were attributed to pembrolizumab.
Case series	Overall response rate was 30% (95% CI, 13% to 53%); median duration of response was 15 months (range, 6 to 26 months).
Case series	A six-gene interferon-γ gene expression signature analysis suggested that delayed progression and increased response occur among pembrolizumab-treated patients with higher interferon-γ composite scores.
Case series	Conclusion Pembrolizumab demonstrated manageable toxicity and durable antitumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated, PD-L1-positive advanced esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Safety and Antitumor Activity of the Anti-Programmed Death-1 Antibody Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Esophageal Carcinoma
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Patients with advanced esophageal cancer have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options after first-line chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In this open-label, phase III study, we randomly assigned (1:1) 628 patients with advanced/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, that progressed after one prior therapy, to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or chemotherapy (investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan).
randomized controlled trial	Primary end points were overall survival (OS) in patients with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10, in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and in all patients (one-sided α 0. 9%, 0. 8%, and 0. 8%, respectively).
randomized controlled trial	Results: At final analysis, conducted 16 months after the last patient was randomly assigned, OS was prolonged with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for patients with CPS ≥ 10 (median, 9. 3 v 6. 7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 69 [95% CI, 0. 52 to 0.
randomized controlled trial	93]; P =. 0074). Estimated 12-month OS rate was 43% (95% CI, 33. 5% to 52. 1%) with pembrolizumab versus 20% (95% CI, 13. 5% to 28. 3%) with chemotherapy. Median OS was 8. 2 months versus 7. 1 months (HR, 0. 78 [95% CI, 0. 63 to 0. 96]; P =.
randomized controlled trial	0095) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 7. 1 months versus 7. 1 months (HR, 0. 89 [95% CI, 0. 75 to 1. 05]; P =. 0560) in all patients. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18. 2% of patients with pembrolizumab versus 40.
randomized controlled trial	9% in those who underwent chemotherapy. Conclusion: Pembrolizumab prolonged OS versus chemotherapy as second-line therapy for advanced esophageal cancer in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Nivolumab treatment for oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma: an open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer refractory to, or intolerant of, two or more previous regimens of chemotherapy have a poor prognosis, and current guidelines do not recommend any specific treatments for these patients.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody inhibitor of programmed death-1 (PD-1), in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer who had been previously been treated with two or more chemotherapy regimens.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 49 clinical sites in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, eligible patients (aged ≥20 years with unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer refractory to, or intolerant of, standard therapy [including two or more previous chemotherapy regimens], with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status of 0-1, and naive to anti-PD-1 therapy or other therapeutic antibodies and pharmacotherapies for the regulation of T cells) were recruited.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using an interactive web response system to receive 3 mg/kg nivolumab or placebo intravenously every 2 weeks, stratified by country, ECOG performance status, and number of organs with metastases.
randomized controlled trial	Study treatment was continued until progressive disease per investigator assessment or onset of toxicities requiring permanent discontinuation. Patients and investigators were masked to group assignment.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.
randomized controlled trial	This study is ongoing but not recruiting new patients, and is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02267343. Findings: Between Nov 4, 2014, and Feb 26, 2016, we randomly assigned 493 patients to receive nivolumab (n=330) or placebo (n=163).
randomized controlled trial	At the data cutoff (Aug 13, 2016), median follow-up in surviving patients was 8·87 months (IQR 6·57-12·37) in the nivolumab group and 8·59 months (5·65-11·37) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 5·26 months (95% CI 4·60-6·37) in the nivolumab group and 4·14 months (3·42-4·86) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·63, 95% CI 0·51-0·78; p<0·0001).
randomized controlled trial	12-month overall survival rates were 26·2% (95% CI 20·7-32·0) with nivolumab and 10·9% (6·2-17·0) with placebo.
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (10%) of 330 patients who received nivolumab and seven (4%) of 161 patients who received placebo; treatment-related adverse events led to death in five (2%) of 330 patients in the nivolumab group and two (1%) of 161 patients in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	No new safety signals were observed. Interpretation: In this phase 3 study, the survival benefits indicate that nivolumab might be a new treatment option for heavily pretreated patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.

randomized controlled trial	We assessed the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab in Western patients with chemotherapy-refractory esophagogastric cancers.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic chemotherapy-refractory gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer from centers in the United States and Europe received nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was objective response rate. The association of tumor programmed death-ligand 1 status with response and survival was also evaluated.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 160 treated patients (59 with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, 49 with nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, 52 with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg), 79% had received two or more prior therapies.
randomized controlled trial	At the data cutoff, investigator-assessed objective response rates were 12% (95% CI, 5% to 23%), 24% (95% CI, 13% to 39%), and 8% (95% CI, 2% to 19%) in the three groups, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Responses were observed regardless of tumor programmed death-ligand 1 status.
randomized controlled trial	With a median follow-up of 28, 24, and 22 months across the three groups, 12-month progression-free survival rates were 8%, 17%, and 10%, respectively; 12-month OS rates were 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 17%, 47%, and 27% of patients in the three groups, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity, durable responses, encouraging long-term OS, and a manageable safety profile in patients with chemotherapy-refractory esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III studies evaluating nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab in earlier lines of therapy for esophagogastric cancers are underway.
randomized controlled trial	CheckMate-032 Study: Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab and Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: There currently are no internationally recognised treatment guidelines for patients with advanced gastric cancer/gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC) in whom two prior lines of therapy have failed.
randomized controlled trial	The randomised, phase III JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial compared avelumab versus physician's choice of chemotherapy as third-line therapy in patients with advanced GC/GEJC.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic GC/GEJC were recruited at 147 sites globally.
randomized controlled trial	All patients were randomised to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or irinotecan 150 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, each of a 4-week treatment cycle); patients ineligible for chemotherapy received best supportive care.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Results: A total of 371 patients were randomised.
randomized controlled trial	The trial did not meet its primary end point of improving OS {median, 4. 6 versus 5. 0 months; hazard ratio (HR)=1. 1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 9-1. 4]; P = 0. 81} or the secondary end points of PFS [median, 1. 4 versus 2. 7 months; HR=1.
randomized controlled trial	73 (95% CI 1. 4-2. 2); P > 0. 99] or ORR (2. 2% versus 4. 3%) in the avelumab versus chemotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 90 patients (48. 9%) and 131 patients (74.
randomized controlled trial	0%) in the avelumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 17 patients (9. 2%) in the avelumab arm and in 56 patients (31. 6%) in the chemotherapy arm.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Treatment of patients with GC/GEJC with single-agent avelumab in the third-line setting did not result in an improvement in OS or PFS compared with chemotherapy. Avelumab showed a more manageable safety profile than chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Trial registration: ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT02625623.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III, randomised trial of avelumab versus physician's choice of chemotherapy as third-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer: primary analysis of JAVELIN Gastric 300
randomized controlled trial	Background: Chemotherapy for patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma offers poor long-term survival prospects.
randomized controlled trial	We report the final analysis from our study of the immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (ATTRACTION-3) at 90 hospitals and cancer centres in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA.
randomized controlled trial	We enrolled patients aged 20 years and older with unresectable advanced or recurrent oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.
randomized controlled trial	1, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and who were refractory or intolerant to one previous fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab (240 mg for 30 min every 2 weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given intravenously.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1. 1 or unacceptable toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients.
randomized controlled trial	Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02569242, and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	At the time of data cutoff on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 4·5-19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6-15·2) in the chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 10·9 months, 95% CI 9·2-13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·2-9·9; hazard ratio for death 0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·019).
randomized controlled trial	38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [2%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	Five deaths were deemed treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one each of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one each of pneumonia, spinal cord abscess, and interstitial lung disease).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survivaland a favourable safety profile compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and might represent a new standard second-line treatment option for these patients.

randomized controlled trial	Ten treatment-related deaths occurred, seven (3%) in the camrelizumab group (three deaths from unknown causes, one enterocolitis, one hepatic function abnormal, one pneumonitis, and one myocarditis) and three (1%) in the chemotherapy group (two deaths from unknown causes, and one gastrointestinal haemorrhage).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Second-line camrelizumab significantly improved overall survival in patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile.
randomized controlled trial	It might represent a potential option of standard second-line treatment for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China. Funding: Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine.
randomized controlled trial	Camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy as second-line therapy for advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCORT): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study
randomized controlled trial	Background: Patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progresses on chemotherapy have poor outcomes.
randomized controlled trial	We compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progressed on first-line chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at 148 medical centres in 30 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or standard-dose paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	Primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or higher. Safety was assessed in all patients, irrespective of CPS.
randomized controlled trial	The significance threshold for overall survival was p=0·0135 (one-sided). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02370498. Findings: Between June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled.
randomized controlled trial	Of the 395 patients who had a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher, 196 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab and 199 patients were assigned to receive paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	As of Oct 26, 2017, 326 patients in the population with CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 6·2-10·7) with pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6-9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·66-1·03; one-sided p=0·0421).
randomized controlled trial	Median progression-free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4-2·0) with pembrolizumab and 4·1 months (3·1-4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03-1·57).

randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel as second-line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher.
randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab had a better safety profile than paclitaxel. Additional trials of pembrolizumab in gastric and gastro-oesophageal cancer are ongoing. Funding: Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.
randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel for previously treated, advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (KEYNOTE-061): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: In the phase III KEYNOTE-181 study (NCT02564263) of patients with advanced esophageal cancer (EC), pembrolizumab monotherapy prolonged overall survival versus chemotherapy as second-line therapy in patients with programmed death ligand 1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10.
randomized controlled trial	We present the results of the prespecified health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) analyses of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), CPS ≥ 10, and CPS ≥ 10 SCC populations.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: HRQoL was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ EC questionnaire (OES18), and EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D).
randomized controlled trial	Data were analyzed in patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment and completed ≥ 1 HRQoL assessment.
randomized controlled trial	Key analyses included baseline to week 9 least squares mean change in global health status/quality of life, functional or symptom subscales, and time to deterioration (≥ 10-point deterioration) for specific subscales.
randomized controlled trial	Results: The HRQoL population included 387 patients with SCC. Compliance and completion rates for all three questionnaires were similar in both treatment groups at baseline and week 9.
randomized controlled trial	No clinically meaningful differences in global health status/quality of life scores were observed between treatment groups from baseline to week 9 (least squares mean difference, 2. 80; 95% CI, -1. 48 to 7.
randomized controlled trial	08); patients in both treatment groups generally exhibited stable functioning and symptom scores of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 from baseline to week 9. Time to deterioration for pain (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 22; 95% CI, 0. 79 to 1. 89), reflux (HR, 2.
randomized controlled trial	38; 95% CI, 1. 33 to 4. 25), and dysphagia (HR, 1. 53; 95% CI, 1. 02 to 2. 31) subscales were similar between treatment groups. These findings were generally similar in the CPS ≥ 10 (n = 218) and CPS ≥ 10 SCC (n = 166) subgroups.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: In patients with advanced EC, pembrolizumab monotherapy and chemotherapy maintained HRQoL in patients with SCC, CPS ≥ 10, and CPS ≥ 10 SCC.
randomized controlled trial	Impact of Pembrolizumab Versus Chemotherapy as Second-Line Therapy for Advanced Esophageal Cancer on Health-Related Quality of Life in KEYNOTE-181
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This study evaluated the continuous use of trastuzumab beyond progression (TBP) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with HER2-positive advanced G/GEJ cancer refractory to first-line chemotherapy with trastuzumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum were eligible.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel (80 mg/m2, days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (PT; initially 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) arms. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
randomized controlled trial	Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rate, and safety.
randomized controlled trial	Biomarkers such as HER2 expression status in tumor tissue after first-line treatment, HER2 amplification evaluated in serum cell-free DNA, and soluble HER2 levels were analyzed.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Overall, 91 patients were allocated to the paclitaxel (n = 46) and PT (n = 45) arms. The median PFS in the paclitaxel and PT arms was 3. 2 and 3. 7 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 91; 80% CI, 0. 67 to 1. 22; P =.
randomized controlled trial	33), and the median OS in both arms was 10 months (HR, 1. 2; 95% CI, 0. 75 to 2. 0; P =. 20). The overall response rates in the paclitaxel and PT arms were 32% and 33%, respectively (P = 1. 00), and safety was comparable between the 2 arms.
randomized controlled trial	On exploratory analyses, HER2 positivity of tumor tissues was lost after first-line chemotherapy in 11 (69%) of 16 patients whose tumor tissues were available, and circulating HER2 DNA amplification was detected in 41 (60%) of 68 patients.
randomized controlled trial	However, no biomarkers associated with efficacy of TBP were found. Conclusion: The TBP strategy failed to improve PFS in patients with HER2-positive advanced G/GEJ cancer, and no beneficial biomarkers were found.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized, Phase II Study of Trastuzumab Beyond Progression in Patients With HER2-Positive Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer: WJOG7112G (T-ACT Study)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: In Asian countries, paclitaxel once per week is used as second-line treatment in advanced gastric cancer, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive tumors.
randomized controlled trial	The role of anti-HER2 agents, including lapatinib, in this setting and population is unclear. Patients and methods: TyTAN was a two-part, parallel-group, phase III study in Asian patients.
randomized controlled trial	An open-label, dose-optimization phase (n = 12) was followed by a randomized phase (n = 261), in which patients who were HER2 positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) received lapatinib 1,500 mg once per day plus once-per-week paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) or paclitaxel alone.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall response rate (ORR), time to response, response duration, and safety.
randomized controlled trial	Analyses were based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gastrectomy status, prior trastuzumab therapy, and regional subpopulations. Results: Median OS was 11. 0 months with lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus 8. 9 months with paclitaxel alone (P =.
randomized controlled trial	1044), with no significant difference in median PFS (5. 4 v 4. 4 months) or TTP (5. 5 v 4. 4 months). ORR was higher with lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone (odds ratio, 3. 85; P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Better efficacy with lapatinib plus paclitaxel was demonstrated in IHC3+ compared with IHC0/1+ and 2+ patients and in Chinese compared with Japanese patients.
randomized controlled trial	A similar proportion of patients experienced adverse events with each treatment (lapatinib plus paclitaxel, 100% v paclitaxel alone, 98%).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Lapatinib plus paclitaxel demonstrated activity in the second-line treatment of patients with HER2 FISH-positive IHC3+ advanced gastric cancer but did not significantly improve OS in the intent-to-treat population.
randomized controlled trial	Lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in the second-line treatment of HER2-amplified advanced gastric cancer in Asian populations: TyTAN--a randomized, phase III study
randomized controlled trial	Introduction: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification is present in a subgroup of gastroo-esophageal cancers (GCs). HER2 inhibition with trastuzumab has shown to improve outcomes in advanced disease.
randomized controlled trial	Lapatinib ditosylate (LAP), a dual anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity against GC, has been approved in HER2-positive breast cancer.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to study the activity of LAP in HER2-amplified GC.
randomized controlled trial	Materials and methods: Patients (pts) with HER2-positive (gene amplification or increased copy numbers based on predefined criteria) advanced GC were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive LAP 1250mg per day 1-21 plus capecitabine (CAP) 2000mg/m(2) on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle or LAP 1500mg monotherapy day 1-21 after having failed on a platinum-based first-line therapy.
randomized controlled trial	HER2 status was assessed centrally. The primary end-point was the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1. 1).
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to include 38 pts per arm to show an interesting response rate of ⩾20% in either of the two arms. Results: 37 pts were enrolled (18 to LAP+CAP, 19 to LAP). Pts had received a median of three prior treatment lines.
randomized controlled trial	12 pts in the LAP+CAP group (67%) and 12 pts in the LAP group (63%) had received prior trastuzumab. Only two pts (11. 1%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1. 37-34. 7), both in the LAP+CAP arm, achieved an objective response.
randomized controlled trial	The study was closed prematurely for futility. Median time to progression was 42 (95% CI: 38-61) days in the LAP group and 83 (95% CI: 42-86) days in the LAP+CAP group.
randomized controlled trial	Other secondary efficacy end-points (progression-free and overall survival) were comparable in the two treatment groups.
randomized controlled trial	Rates of diarrhoea were higher with LAP+CAP (61%; 95% CI: 35-83) compared to 26% (95% CI 9-51) with LAP mono, whereas other adverse events were mostly similar between the groups (18 [100%] versus 17 [90%]).
randomized controlled trial	Discussion: Lapatinib showed insufficient activity in HER2-amplified pretreated advanced GC. The safety profile of LAP or LAP+CAP was as expected with some more toxicity in the combination arm. (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier, NCT01145404).
randomized controlled trial	Lapatinib versus lapatinib plus capecitabine as second-line treatment in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-amplified metastatic gastro-oesophageal cancer: a randomised phase II trial of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie
randomized controlled trial	Background: Although trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard of care for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer, there is no established therapy in the second-line setting.
randomized controlled trial	In GATSBY, we examined the efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab emtansine in patients previously treated for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic gastric cancer, including adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This is the final analysis from GATSBY, a randomised, open-label, adaptive, phase 2/3 study, done at 107 centres (28 countries worldwide).
randomized controlled trial	Eligible patients had HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer and progressed during or after first-line therapy.
randomized controlled trial	In stage one of the trial, patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (2:2:1) to receive intravenous trastuzumab emtansine (3·6 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 2·4 mg/kg weekly) or physician's choice of a taxane (intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly).
randomized controlled trial	In stage two, patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (2:1) to receive the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC)-selected dose of trastuzumab emtansine (2·4 mg/kg weekly) or a taxane (same regimen as above).
randomized controlled trial	We used permuted block randomisation, stratified by world region, previous HER2-targeted therapy, and previous gastrectomy. The primary endpoint (overall survival) was assessed in the intention-to-treat population.
randomized controlled trial	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01641939.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Sept 3, 2012, and Oct 14, 2013, 70 patients were assigned to receive trastuzumab emtansine 3·6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 75 to receive trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly, and 37 to receive a taxane in the stage 1 part of the trial.
randomized controlled trial	At the pre-planned interim analysis (Oct 14, 2013), the IDMC selected trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly as the dose to proceed to stage 2.
randomized controlled trial	By Feb 9, 2015, a further 153 patients had been randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly and a further 80 to receive a taxane.
randomized controlled trial	At data cutoff, median follow-up was 17·5 months (IQR 12·1-23·0) for the trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly group and 15·4 months (9·2-18·1) in the taxane group.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 7·9 months (95% CI 6·7-9·5) with trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly and 8·6 months (7·1-11·2) with taxane treatment (hazard ratio 1·15, 95% CI 0·87-1·51, one-sided p=0·86).
randomized controlled trial	The trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg group had lower incidences of grade 3 or more adverse events (134 [60%] of 224 patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine vs 78 [70%] of 111 patients treated with a taxane), and similar incidences of adverse events leading to death (eight [4%] vs four [4%]), serious adverse events (65 [29%] vs 31 [28%]), and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (31 [14%] vs 15 [14%]) than did taxane treatment.
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3 or more adverse events in the trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly group were anaemia (59 [26%]) and thrombocytopenia (25 [11%]) compared with neutropenia (43 [39%]), and anaemia (20 [18%]), in the taxane group.
randomized controlled trial	The most common serious adverse events were anaemia (eight [4%]), upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (eight [4%]), pneumonia (seven [3%]), gastric haemorrhage (six [3%]), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (five [2%]) in the trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly group compared with pneumonia (four [4%]), febrile neutropenia (four [4%]), anaemia (three [3%]), and neutropenia (three [3%]) in the taxane group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Trastuzumab emtansine was not superior to taxane in patients with previously treated, HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. There is still an unmet need in this patient group and therapeutic options remain limited.

Case series	Background: Anti-HER2 therapy has not demonstrated a survival advantage in the second-line setting of patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.
Case series	We conducted this study to assess changes in HER2 status and to identify possible biomarkers for acquired resistance after the use of trastuzumab as the first-line therapy.
Case series	Patients and methods: Patients with advanced or recurrent HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma who were diagnosed with progressive disease after the first-line trastuzumab-based therapy and developed pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma within 3 months after completion of trastuzumab-based therapy were enrolled in this study.
Case series	We collected re-biopsied samples from the HER2-positive patients who had developed resistance to trastuzumab and re-evaluated their HER2 status.
Case series	Amplification of EGFR and c-met, as well as PIK3CA mutation, were comparatively analysed when samples were available. Results: Among 33 eligible patients, loss of HER2 was identified in 20 patients (60. 6%) with refractory disease.
Case series	Immunohistochemistry showed that the rate of HER2 overexpression was greatly reduced after therapy (pre-HER2 3+: 24 [72. 7%] vs. post-HER2 3+: 13 [39. 4%]).
Case series	We found that the use of fixatives other than 10% neutral buffered formalin significantly reduced the HER2-positive rate. EGFR amplification, c-met amplification and PIK3CA mutation before and after trastuzumab-based therapy were observed in 10.
Case series	3% and 3. 8%, 17. 9% and 4. 2% and 4. 0% and 4. 2% of cases, respectively. Conclusion: Re-evaluation of HER2 status is needed to determine the appropriate use of anti-HER2-targeted therapy after disease progression.
Case series	Our results also highlight the importance of formalin fixation conditions for HER2 testing.

Cohort study	The incidence of esophagogastric cancer is rapidly rising, but only a minority of patients derive durable benefit from current therapies. Chemotherapy as well as anti-HER2 and PD-1 antibodies are standard treatments.
Cohort study	To identify predictive biomarkers of drug sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance, we implemented prospective tumor sequencing of patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer.
Cohort study	There was no association between homologous recombination deficiency defects and response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
Cohort study	Patients with microsatellite instability-high tumors were intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy but more likely to achieve durable responses to immunotherapy.
Cohort study	The single Epstein-Barr virus-positive patient achieved a durable, complete response to immunotherapy. The level of ERBB2 amplification as determined by sequencing was predictive of trastuzumab benefit.
Cohort study	Selection for a tumor subclone lacking ERBB2 amplification, deletion of ERBB2 exon 16, and comutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase, RAS, and PI3K pathways were associated with intrinsic and/or acquired trastuzumab resistance.
Cohort study	Prospective genomic profiling can identify patients most likely to derive durable benefit to immunotherapy and trastuzumab and guide strategies to overcome drug resistance.
Cohort study	Significance: Clinical application of multiplex sequencing can identify biomarkers of treatment response to contemporary systemic therapies in metastatic esophagogastric cancer.

Cohort study	Genetic Predictors of Response to Systemic Therapy in Esophagogastric Cancer
Case series	Mechanisms of acquired resistance to trastuzumab-based treatment in gastric cancer are largely unknown.
Case series	In this study, we analyzed 22 pairs of tumor samples taken at baseline and post-progression in patients receiving chemotherapy and trastuzumab for advanced HER2-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or 2+ with in-situ hybridization (ISH) amplification] gastric or gastroesophageal cancers.
Case series	Strict clinical criteria for defining acquired trastuzumab resistance were adopted.
Case series	Loss of HER2 positivity and loss of HER2 over-expression were defined as post-trastuzumab IHC score <3+ and absence of ISH amplification, and IHC "downscoring" from 2+/3+ to 0/1+, respectively.
Case series	HER2 IHC was always performed, while ISH was missing in 3 post-progression samples. Patients with initial HER2 IHC score 3+ and 2+ were 14 (64%) and 8 (36%), respectively.
Case series	Loss of HER2 positivity and HER2 over-expression was observed in 32 and 32% samples, respectively. The chance of HER2 loss was not associated with any of the baseline clinicopathological variables.
Case series	The only exception was in patients with initial IHC score 2+ versus 3+, for both endpoints of HER2 positivity (80 vs. 14%; p = 0. 008) and HER2 over-expression (63 vs. 14%; p = 0. 025).
Case series	As already shown in breast cancer, loss of HER2 may be observed also in gastric cancers patients treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy in the clinical practice.
Case series	This phenomenon may be one of the biological reasons explaining the failure of anti-HER2 second-line strategies in initially HER2-positive disease.
Case series	HER2 loss in HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal cancer after trastuzumab therapy: Implication for further clinical research
randomized controlled trial	Background: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor.
randomized controlled trial	The drug may have efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan as compared with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed while they were receiving at least two previous therapies, including trastuzumab, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.
randomized controlled trial	4 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary end points included overall survival, response duration, progression-free survival, confirmed response (response persisting ≥4 weeks), and safety.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 187 treated patients, 125 received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 62 chemotherapy (55 received irinotecan and 7 paclitaxel).
randomized controlled trial	An objective response was reported in 51% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group, as compared with 14% of those in the physician's choice group (P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan than with chemotherapy (median, 12. 5 vs. 8. 4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0. 59; 95% confidence interval, 0. 39 to 0. 88; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	01, which crossed the prespecified O'Brien-Fleming boundary [0. 0202 on the basis of number of deaths]).
randomized controlled trial	The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 51% of the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 24% of the physician's choice group), anemia (38% and 23%, respectively), and decreased white-cell count (21% and 11%).
randomized controlled trial	A total of 12 patients had trastuzumab deruxtecan-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (grade 1 or 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 or 4 in 3), as adjudicated by an independent committee.
randomized controlled trial	One drug-related death (due to pneumonia) was noted in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group; no drug-related deaths occurred in the physician's choice group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan led to significant improvements in response and overall survival, as compared with standard therapies, among patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Myelosuppression and interstitial lung disease were the notable toxic effects. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo; DESTINY-Gastric01 ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT03329690. ).
randomized controlled trial	Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Previously Treated HER2-Positive Gastric Cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Trifluridine/tipiracil showed activity and was well tolerated in a phase 2 study of pretreated patients with advanced gastric cancer done in Japan.
randomized controlled trial	We investigated whether the treatment was efficacious compared with placebo in a global population. Methods: TAGS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done in 110 academic hospitals in 17 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, non-resectable, metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction) as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification (7th edition) who had received at least two previous chemotherapy regimens and had experienced radiological disease progression were eligible for inclusion.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via dynamic randomisation from a centralised interactive voice-response system to receive either oral trifluridine/tipiracil (35 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-5 and days 8-12 every 28 days) plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care.
randomized controlled trial	Participants were allocated to groups by study-site personnel. Randomisation was stratified by region (Japan vs rest of world), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), and previous treatment with ramucirumab (yes vs no).
randomized controlled trial	Both patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02500043. The trial, including follow-up of all participants, has been completed.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Feb 24, 2016, and Jan 5, 2018, 507 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 337 to the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 170 to the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·8-6·2) in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 3·6 months (3·1-4·1) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·69 [95% CI 0·56-0·85]; one-sided p=0·00029, two-sided p=0·00058).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause occurred in 267 (80%) patients in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 97 (58%) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause were neutropenia (n=114 [34%]) and anaemia (n=64 [19%]) in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and abdominal pain (n=15 [9%]) and general deterioration of physical health (n=15 [9%]) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	Serious adverse events of any cause were reported in 143 (43%) patients in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 70 (42%) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	One treatment-related death was reported in each group (because of cardiopulmonary arrest in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and because of toxic hepatitis in the placebo group).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Trifluridine/tipiracil significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo and was well tolerated in this heavily pretreated population of patients with advanced gastric cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Trifluridine/tipiracil versus placebo in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic gastric cancer (TAGS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Importance: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) treatment has shown clinical benefit in patients with pretreated metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer (mGC/GEJC).
randomized controlled trial	Patients who have undergone gastrectomy constitute a significant proportion of patients with mGC/GEJC. Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of FTD/TPI among patients with previously treated mGC/GEJC who had or had not undergone gastrectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: This preplanned subgroup analysis of TAGS (TAS-102 Gastric Study), a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial included patients with mGC/GEJC who had received at least 2 previous chemotherapy regimens, and was conducted at 110 academic hospitals in 17 countries in Europe, Asia, and North America, with enrollment between February 24, 2016, and January 5, 2018; the data cutoff was March 31, 2018.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 twice daily or placebo twice daily with best supportive care on days 1 through 5 and days 8 through 12 of each 28-day treatment cycle.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was overall survival. This subgroup analysis was conducted to examine potential trends and was not powered for statistical significance. Efficacy and safety end points were evaluated in the subgroups.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 507 randomized patients (369 [72. 8%] male; mean [SD] age, 62. 5 [10. 5] years), 221 (43. 6%) had undergone gastrectomy (147 randomized to FTD/TPI and 74 to placebo) and 286 (56.
randomized controlled trial	4%) had not undergone gastrectomy (190 randomized to FTD/TPI and 96 to placebo). In the gastrectomy subgroup, the overall survival hazard ratio (HR) in the FTD/TPI group vs placebo group was 0. 57 (95% CI, 0. 41-0.
randomized controlled trial	79), and the progression-free survival HR was 0. 48 (95% CI, 0. 35-0. 65). In the no gastrectomy subgroup, the overall survival HR in the FTD/TPI group vs placebo group was 0. 80 (95% CI, 0. 60-1. 06), and the progression-free survival HR was 0.
randomized controlled trial	65 (95% CI, 0. 49-0. 85). Among FTD/TPI-treated patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 122 of 145 patients (84. 1%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 145 of 190 (76. 3%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup: 64 (44.
randomized controlled trial	1%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 50 (26. 3%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup had grade 3 or higher neutropenia, 31 (21. 4%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 33 (17. 4%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup had grade 3 or higher anemia, and 21 (14.
randomized controlled trial	5%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 10 (5. 3%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup hD grade 3 or higher leukopenia. In the gastrectomy subgroup, 94 (64. 8%) had dosing modifications because of adverse events vs 101 (53.
randomized controlled trial	2%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup; 15 (10. 3%) in the gastrectomy group and 28 (14. 7%) in the no gastrectomy group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Treatment exposure was similar between groups.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions and relevance: The FTD/TPI treatment was tolerable and provided efficacy benefits among patients with pretreated mGC/GEJC regardless of previous gastrectomy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT02500043.
randomized controlled trial	Efficacy and Safety of Trifluridine/Tipiracil Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Gastric Cancer Who Had Undergone Gastrectomy: Subgroup Analyses of a Randomized Clinical Trial
Case series	This study was undertaken to determine the value of tumour microvessel density (MVD) and the expression of p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as prognostic markers in patients with gastric cancer operated on for cure.
Case series	In all, 156 patients with curatively resected gastric cancer constituted the basis of this blinded retrospective evaluation. Patients were treated with either surgery alone (n=53) or surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy (n=103).
Case series	Tumour MVD, p53 expression, and VEGF expression were assayed using immunohistochemical techniques. After a mean follow-up of 43 months, 64 (41%) patients had died and 55 (35%) patients developed tumour recurrence.
Case series	Positive correlations between MVD and both p53 (P=0. 005) and VEGF (P=0. 005) expression were observed. Both MVD >/=100 (P=0. 05) and positive VEGF expression (P<0.
Case series	02) were associated with shorter disease-free survival, and positive VEGF expression (P=0. 01) was also associated with shorter overall survival.
Case series	Multivariate analysis confirmed that, in addition to the pathological tumour stage, lymph node ratio, the extent of lymphadenectomy and perineural invasion, p53 expression, and VEGF expression were independently associated with both disease-free survival (P<0.
Case series	0005 and 0. 02, respectively) and overall survival (P<0. 02 and 0. 01, respectively). Finally, patients whose tumours did not show p53 expression had a survival benefit compared to those expressing p53 when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.
Case series	01).
Case series	This investigation demonstrates that p53 expression and VEGF expression are independent prognostic factors for both disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with curatively resected gastric cancer, and that p53 status may also influence response to chemotherapy.
Case series	p53 and VEGF expression are independent predictors of tumour recurrence and survival following curative resection of gastric cancer
Case series	The biological and clinical behaviors of cancer are affected by multiple molecular pathways that are under the control of transcription factors.
Case series	Improved understanding of how transcription factors affect cancer biology may lead to improved ability to predict clinical outcome and discovery of novel therapeutic strategies.
Case series	We evaluated the relationship between Sp1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, as well as their effect on survival in 86 cases of resected human gastric cancer.
Case series	The degree of VEGF expression correlated highly with Sp1 expression (P < 0. 01). Patients with high Sp1 expression were 98 times more likely to have high VEGF expression compared with those with negative Sp1 expression.
Case series	Clinically, negative or weak Sp1 expression was associated with early stage (IA) in gastric cancer. Strong Sp1 expression was more frequently observed among patients with stage IB-IV disease (P = 0. 035).
Case series	Similarly, whereas strong Sp1 expression was uncommonly observed among patients with N0 or N1 disease (19 and 16%), N2/N3 gastric cancer was associated with strong Sp1 expression (48%; P = 0. 034).
Case series	Strong Sp1 expression was also associated with inferior survival. The median survival duration in patients who had a tumor with a negative, weak, and strong Sp1 expression was 44, 38, and 8 months (P = 0.
Case series	0075), respectively, whereas patients with strong VEGF expression had a shorter survival duration; the difference was not statistically significant.
Case series	When Sp1 and VEGF expression, stage, completeness of resection, histology, and patient age were entered in a Cox proportional hazards model, strong Sp1 expression (P = 0. 021) and an advanced disease stage (P < 0.
Case series	001) were independently prognostic of poor survival.
Case series	Given the importance of Sp1 in the expression of VEGF, our data suggest that dysregulated Sp1 expression and activation play important roles in VEGF overexpression and, thus, gastric cancer development and progression.
Case series	Association between expression of transcription factor Sp1 and increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression, advanced stage, and poor survival in patients with resected gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: VEGFR-2 has a role in gastric cancer pathogenesis and progression.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, in combination with paclitaxel would increase overall survival in patients previously treated for advanced gastric cancer compared with placebo plus paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial was done at 170 centres in 27 countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression on or within 4 months after first-line chemotherapy (platinum plus fluoropyrimidine with or without an anthracycline) were randomly assigned with a centralised interactive voice or web-response system in a 1:1 ratio to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously on days 1 and 15, plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.
randomized controlled trial	A permuted block randomisation, stratified by geographic region, time to progression on first-line therapy, and disease measurability, was used. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and safety analysis included all patients who received at least one treatment with study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.
randomized controlled trial	gov, number NCT01170663, and has been completed; patients who are still receiving treatment are in the extension phase.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Dec 23, 2010, and Sept 23, 2012, 665 patients were randomly assigned to treatment-330 to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel and 335 to placebo plus paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group than in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (median 9·6 months [95% CI 8·5-10·8] vs 7·4 months [95% CI 6·3-8·4], hazard ratio 0·807 [95% CI 0·678-0·962]; p=0·017).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in more than 5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group versus placebo plus paclitaxel included neutropenia (133 [41%] of 327 vs 62 [19%] of 329), leucopenia (57 [17%] vs 22 [7%]), hypertension (46 [14%] vs eight [2%]), fatigue (39 [12%] vs 18 [5%]), anaemia (30 [9%] vs 34 [10%]), and abdominal pain (20 [6%] vs 11 [3%]).
randomized controlled trial	The incidence of grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia was low in both groups (ten [3%] vs eight [2%]).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: The combination of ramucirumab with paclitaxel significantly increases overall survival compared with placebo plus paclitaxel, and could be regarded as a new standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (RAINBOW): a double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: In the global phase 3 RAINBOW study, ramucirumab plus paclitaxel significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	RAINBOW-Asia, a bridging study with similar design to RAINBOW, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel for advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in Asian, predominantly Chinese, patients.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: RAINBOW-Asia was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 32 centres in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
randomized controlled trial	Adult patients (≥18 years) with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who previously received fluoropyrimidine-platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned with a centralised interactive web response system in a 2:1 ratio to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and presence of peritoneal metastases. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT02898077, and has been completed.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between March 2, 2017, and June 30, 2020, 440 patients were randomly assigned to receive ramucirumab plus paclitaxel (n=294) or placebo plus paclitaxel (n=146).
randomized controlled trial	Median progression-free survival was 4·14 months (95% CI 3·71-4·30) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group compared with 3·15 months (2·83-4·14) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·765, 95% CI 0·613-0·955, p=0·0184).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 8·71 months (95% CI 7·98-9·49) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group and 7·92 months (6·31-9·10) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (HR 0·963, 95% CI 0·771-1·203, p=0·7426).
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (159 [54%] of 293 patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group vs 56 [39%] of 145 in the placebo plus paclitaxel group), decreased white blood cell count (127 [43%] vs 42 [29%]), anaemia (46 [16%] vs 24 [17%]), hypertension (21 [7%] vs nine [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (18 [6%] vs one [<1%]).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: These findings, along with the results from RAINBOW, support the use of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in a predominantly Chinese population with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

randomized controlled trial	Efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab as second-line therapy for the treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (RAINBOW-Asia): a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 trial
Before and after control trial	Purpose: Bevacizumab improves survival in several solid tumor malignancies when combined with chemotherapy.
Before and after control trial	We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in the treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
Before and after control trial	Patients and methods: Forty-seven patients with metastatic or unresectable gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma were treated with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1, irinotecan 65 mg/m2, and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, every 21 days.
Before and after control trial	The primary end point was to demonstrate a 50% improvement in time to progression over historical values. Secondary end points included safety, response, and survival.
Before and after control trial	Results: Patient characteristics were as follows: median age 59 years (range, 25 to 75); Karnofsky performance status 90% (70% to 100%); male:female, 34:13; and gastric/GEJ, 24:23. With a median follow-up of 12.
Before and after control trial	2 months, median time to progression was 8. 3 months (95% CI, 5. 5 to 9. 9 months). In 34 patients with measurable disease, the overall response rate was 65% (95% CI, 46% to 80%). Median survival was 12. 3 months (95% CI, 11. 3 to 17. 2 months).
Before and after control trial	We observed no increase in chemotherapy related toxicity.
Before and after control trial	Possible bevacizumab-related toxicity included a 28% incidence of grade 3 hypertension, two patients with a gastric perforation and one patient with a near perforation (6%), and one patient with a myocardial infarction (2%).
Before and after control trial	Grade 3 to 4 thromboembolic events occurred in 25% of patients. Although the primary tumor was unresected in 40 patients, we observed only one patient with a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed.
Before and after control trial	Conclusion: Bevacizumab can be safely given with chemotherapy even with primary gastric and GEJ tumors in place.
Before and after control trial	The response rate, time to disease progression (TTP), and overall survival are encouraging, with TTP improved over historical controls by 75%. Further development of bevacizumab in gastric and GEJ cancers is warranted.
Before and after control trial	Multicenter phase II study of irinotecan, cisplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The Avastin in Gastric Cancer (AVAGAST) trial was a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of adding bevacizumab to capecitabine-cisplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients received bevacizumab 7. 5 mg/kg or placebo followed by cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Fluorouracil was permitted in patients unable to take oral medications. Cisplatin was given for six cycles; capecitabine and bevacizumab were administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Log-rank test was used to test the OS difference. Results: In all, 774 patients were enrolled; 387 were assigned to each treatment group (intention-to-treat population), and 517 deaths were observed.
randomized controlled trial	Median OS was 12. 1 months with bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine-cisplatin and 10. 1 months with placebo plus fluoropyrimidine-cisplatin (hazard ratio 0. 87; 95% CI, 0. 73 to 1. 03; P =. 1002). Both median progression-free survival (6. 7 v 5.
randomized controlled trial	3 months; hazard ratio, 0. 80; 95% CI, 0. 68 to 0. 93; P =. 0037) and overall response rate (46. 0% v 37. 4%; P =. 0315) were significantly improved with bevacizumab versus placebo.
randomized controlled trial	Preplanned subgroup analyses revealed regional differences in efficacy outcomes.
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3 to 5 adverse events were neutropenia (35%, bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine-cisplatin; 37%, placebo plus fluoropyrimidine-cisplatin), anemia (10% v 14%), and decreased appetite (8% v 11%).
randomized controlled trial	No new bevacizumab-related safety signals were identified.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Although AVAGAST did not reach its primary objective, adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy was associated with significant increases in progression-free survival and overall response rate in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in advanced gastric cancer: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The AVAGAST study showed that adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer improves progression-free survival and tumor response rate but not overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	To examine the hypothesis that angiogenic markers may have predictive value for bevacizumab efficacy in gastric cancer, AVAGAST included a prospective, mandatory biomarker program.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer were randomly assigned to bevacizumab (n = 387) or placebo (n = 387) in combination with chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Blood and tumor tissue samples were collected at baseline. Prespecified biomarkers included plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), protein expression of neuropilin-1, and VEGF receptors-1 and -2 (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2).
randomized controlled trial	Correlations between biomarkers and clinical outcomes were assessed by using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Plasma was available from 712 patients (92%), and tumor samples were available from 727 patients (94%).
randomized controlled trial	Baseline plasma VEGF-A levels and tumor neuropilin-1 expression were identified as potential predictors of bevacizumab efficacy. Patients with high baseline plasma VEGF-A levels showed a trend toward improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.
randomized controlled trial	72; 95% CI, 0. 57 to 0. 93) versus patients with low VEGF-A levels (HR, 1. 01; 95% CI, 0. 77 to 1. 31; interaction P =. 07). Patients with low baseline expression of neuropilin-1 also showed a trend toward improved overall survival (HR, 0.
randomized controlled trial	75; 95% CI, 0. 59 to 0. 97) versus patients with high neuropilin-1 expression (HR, 1. 07; 95% CI, 0. 81 to 1. 40; interaction P =. 06). For both biomarkers, subgroup analyses demonstrated significance only in patients from non-Asian regions.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Plasma VEGF-A and tumor neuropilin-1 are strong biomarker candidates for predicting clinical outcome in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with bevacizumab.
randomized controlled trial	Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in advanced gastric cancer: a biomarker evaluation from the AVAGAST randomized phase III trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: There is currently no standard treatment strategy for patients with advanced metastatic gastric cancer experiencing progression after two or more lines of chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed the efficacy and safety of apatinib, a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma for whom at least two lines of prior chemotherapy had failed.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial.
randomized controlled trial	Patients from 32 centers in China with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, for whom two or more prior lines of chemotherapy had failed, were enrolled.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned to oral apatinib 850 mg or placebo once daily. The primary end points were overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Between January 2011 and November 2012, 267 patients were enrolled.
randomized controlled trial	Median OS was significantly improved in the apatinib group compared with the placebo group (6. 5 months; 95% CI, 4. 8 to 7. 6 v 4. 7 months; 95% CI, 3. 6 to 5. 4; P =. 0149; hazard ratio, 0. 709; 95% CI, 0. 537 to 0. 937; P =. 0156).
randomized controlled trial	Similarly, apatinib significantly prolonged median PFS compared with placebo (2. 6 months; 95% CI, 2. 0 to 2. 9 v 1. 8 months; 95% CI, 1. 4 to 1. 9; P <. 001; hazard ratio, 0. 444; 95% CI, 0. 331 to 0. 595; P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic adverse events were hand-foot syndrome, proteinuria, and hypertension.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: These data show that apatinib treatment significantly improved OS and PFS with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Trial of Apatinib in Patients With Chemotherapy-Refractory Advanced or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Gastroesophageal Junction
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We evaluated the activity of regorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: We conducted an international (Australia and New Zealand, South Korea, and Canada) randomized phase II trial in which patients were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio and stratified by lines of prior chemotherapy for advanced disease (one v two) and region.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible patients received best supportive care plus regorafenib 160 mg or matching placebo orally on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or prohibitive adverse events occurred.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Final analysis included data to December 31, 2014.
randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 152 patients were randomly assigned from November 7, 2012, to February 25, 2014, yielding 147 evaluable patients (regorafenib, n = 97; placebo, n = 50). Baseline characteristics were balanced.
randomized controlled trial	Median PFS significantly differed between groups (regorafenib, 2. 6 months; 95% CI, 1. 8 to 3. 1 and placebo, 0. 9 months; 95% CI, 0. 9 to 0. 9; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 40; 95% CI, 0. 28 to 0. 59; P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	The effect was greater in South Korea than in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada combined (HR, 0. 12 v 0. 61; interaction P <.
randomized controlled trial	001) but consistent across age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, primary site, lines of chemotherapy, peritoneal metastasis presence, number of metastatic sites, and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor A.
randomized controlled trial	A survival trend in favor of regorafenib was seen (median, 5. 8 months; 95% CI, 4. 4 to 6. 8 v 4. 5 months; 95% CI, 3. 4 to 5. 2; HR, 0. 74; P =. 147). Twenty-nine patients assigned to placebo received open-label regorafenib after disease progression.
randomized controlled trial	Regorafenib toxicity was similar to that previously reported. Conclusion: In this phase II trial, regorafenib was effective in prolonging PFS in refractory advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Regional differences were found, but regorafenib was effective in both regional groups. A phase III trial is planned.
randomized controlled trial	Regorafenib for the Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer (INTEGRATE): A Multinational Placebo-Controlled Phase II Trial
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This phase II, open-label, multicenter study assessed the oral, multitargeted, tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who had received prior chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Experimental design: Patients received sunitinib 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment, followed by 2 weeks off treatment).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was objective response rate; secondary endpoints included clinical benefit rate, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability, and quality of life.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 78 patients enrolled, most had gastric adenocarcinoma (93. 6%) and metastatic disease (93. 6%). All were evaluable for safety and efficacy. Two patients (2. 6%) had partial responses and 25 patients (32.
Non-randomized controlled trial	1%) had a best response of stable disease for ≥6 weeks. Median PFS was 2. 3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 6-2. 6 months) and median OS was 6. 8 months (95% CI, 4. 4-9. 6 months).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 34. 6% and 29. 4% of patients, respectively, and the most common non-hematologic adverse events were fatigue, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, and stomatitis.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and its active metabolite were consistent with previous reports. There were no marked associations between baseline soluble protein levels, or changes from baseline, and measures of clinical outcome.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The progression-delaying effect and manageable toxicity observed with sunitinib in this study suggest that although single-agent sunitinib has insufficient clinical value as second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer, its role in combination with chemotherapy merits further study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II study of sunitinib as second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The combination of sorafenib with chemotherapy is well-tolerated and is associated with encouraging response rates in several malignances. Both docetaxel and cisplatin are active in gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A phase II study was conducted to determine the efficacy and toxicity of combined sorafenib, docetaxel, and cisplatin in patients with metastatic or advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Forty-four chemotherapy-naïve patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, of whom 80% had metastatic disease and two thirds had poorly differentiated gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, were enrolled.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The treatment regimen was sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day for 21 days, docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, repeated every 21 days.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was response rate to the combination. Toxicity, overall survival, and progression-free survival were assessed as secondary end points.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Eighteen of the 44 eligible and treated patients showed partial responses (41%; 90% CI, 28% to 54%). The median progression-free survival was 5. 8 months (90% CI, 5. 4 to 7. 4 months). The median overall survival was 13. 6 months (90% CI, 8.
Non-randomized controlled trial	6 to 16. 1 month). The major toxicity of this regimen was neutropenia, which reached grade 3 to 4 in 64% of patients. One patient experienced hemorrhage at the tumor site.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The combination of sorafenib, docetaxel, and cisplatin has an encouraging efficacy profile with tolerable toxicity. Additional studies of sorafenib with chemotherapy are warranted in gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II study of sorafenib in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin in the treatment of metastatic or advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma: ECOG 5203
randomized controlled trial	Background: Docetaxel is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent for gastric cancer treatment. A combined regimen with sunitinib demonstrated a synergistic antitumour effect in a preclinical model.
randomized controlled trial	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with unresectable or metastatic advanced gastric cancer following failure of treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and platinum combination.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This open-label, phase II, randomised trial enrolled patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were assigned to either a docetaxel monotherapy arm (D only arm: 60 mg m(-2), every 3 weeks) or a combination arm (DS arm: docetaxel+sunitinib 37. 5 mg every day).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point of the study was time to progression and the secondary end points were overall response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, and toxicity profile. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed.
randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 107 patients were entered into the study. The TTP was not significantly prolonged in the DS arm when compared with the D only arm (DS vs D only arm: 3. 9 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 2. 9-4. 9) vs 2. 6 months (95% CI 1.
randomized controlled trial	8-3. 5) (P=0. 206). The hazard ratio for TTP was 0. 77 (95% CI 0. 52-1. 16). However, the objective response rate was significantly higher in the DS arm (41. 1% vs 14. 3%, P=0. 002).
randomized controlled trial	Patients in the DS arm experienced stomatitis, diarrhoea, and hand-foot syndrome more frequently. Conclusion: The addition of sunitinib to docetaxel did not significantly prolong TTP, although it significantly increased response.
randomized controlled trial	Randomised phase II trial of docetaxel and sunitinib in patients with metastatic gastric cancer who were previously treated with fluoropyrimidine and platinum
randomized controlled trial	Background: Antiangiogenic therapy is a proven therapeutic modality for refractory gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	This trial assessed whether the addition of a high affinity angiogenesis inhibitor, ziv-aflibercept, could improve the efficacy of first-line mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and bolus plus infusional 5- fluorouracil) in metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients with treatment-naive metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to receive first-line mFOLFOX6 with or without ziv-aflibercept (4 mg/kg) every 2 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Sixty-four patients were randomized to receive mFOLFOX6 and ziv-aflibercept (43 patients) or mFOLFOX6 and a placebo (21 patients).
randomized controlled trial	There was no difference in the PFS, overall survival, or response rate. Patients treated with mFOLFOX6/ziv-aflibercept tended to be more likely to discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease (P =. 06).
randomized controlled trial	The relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil was lower in the mFOLFOX6/ziv-aflibercept arm during the first 12 and 24 weeks of the trial.
randomized controlled trial	There were 2 treatment-related deaths due to cerebral hemorrhage and bowel perforation in the mFOLFOX6/ziv-aflibercept cohort.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Ziv-aflibercept did not increase the anti-tumor activity of first-line mFOLFOX6 in metastatic esophagogastric cancer, potentially because of decreased dose intensity of FOLFOX.
randomized controlled trial	Further evaluation of ziv-aflibercept in unselected, chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma is not warranted.

review	Since the early 1970s, the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in most Western populations. In contrast, the incidence of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma has decreased in these same populations.
review	Epidemiological studies conducted over the past decade have provided great insights into the etiology of oesophageal cancer.
review	These studies have identified gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, obesity and cigarette smoking as risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma, while use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and infection with Helicobacter pylori are associated with reduced risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
review	For oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, alcohol and cigarette smoking are the two major risk factors underlying most cases.
review	This review combines a synthesis of these studies with an analysis of data from the United States National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to discuss the change in incidence of oesophageal cancer and summarize current knowledge of risk factors.
review	The epidemic of oesophageal carcinoma: Where are we now?
Cross-sectional study	Background: Esophageal cancer rate disparities are pronounced for blacks and whites.
Cross-sectional study	This study presents black-white esophageal cancer incidence, mortality, relative survival rates, histology and trends for two five-year time periods--1991-1995 and 1996-2000--and for the time period 1991-2000.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: The study used data from the National Cancer Institute's population-based Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) program with submission dates 1991-2000.
Cross-sectional study	Age-adjusted incidence, mortality, relative survival rates and histology for esophageal carcinoma were calculated for nine SEER cancer registries for 1991-2000. Rates were analyzed by race and gender for changes over specified time periods.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Esophageal cancer age-adjusted incidence of blacks was about twice that of whites (8. 63 vs. 4. 39/100,000, p < 0. 05). Age-adjusted mortality for blacks, although showing a declining trend, was nearly twice that of whites (7. 79 vs. 3.
Cross-sectional study	96, p < 0. 05). Although survival was poor for all groups, it was significantly poorer in blacks than in whites.
Cross-sectional study	Squamous cell carcinoma was more commonly diagnosed in blacks and white females, whereas adenocarcinoma was more common among white males (p < 0. 001).
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Racial disparities in esophageal cancer incidence, mortality, survival and histology exist. Survival rates from this disease have not significantly improved over the decade.
Cross-sectional study	These data support the need for advances in prevention, early detection biomarker research and research on new, more effective treatment modalities for this disease.

Case-control study	Background: Several risk factors have been identified for esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, but no study has comprehensively examined their contributions to the cancer burden in the general population.
Case-control study	Herein, we estimate the population attributable risks (PARs) for various risk factors observed in a multicenter population-based case-control study.
Case-control study	Methods: We calculated PARs by using 293 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 261 with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, 221 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 368 with noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and 695 control subjects.
Case-control study	We included smoking for all four tumor types and Helicobacter pylori infection for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma as established causal risk factors as well as several other factors for which causality is under evaluation.
Case-control study	Results: Ever smoking, body mass index above the lowest quartile, history of gastroesophageal reflux, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 39. 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25. 6% to 55. 8%), 41. 1% (95% CI = 23. 8% to 60.
Case-control study	9%), 29. 7% (95% CI = 19. 5% to 42. 3%), and 15. 3% (95% CI = 5. 8% to 34. 6%) of esophageal adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 78. 7% (95% CI = 66. 5% to 87. 3%).
Case-control study	Ever smoking and body mass index above the lowest quartile were responsible for 45. 2% (95% CI = 31. 3% to 59. 9%) and 19. 2% (95% CI = 4. 9% to 52. 0%) of gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 56. 2% (95% CI = 38.
Case-control study	1% to 72. 8%). Ever smoking, alcohol consumption, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 56. 9% (95% CI = 36. 6% to 75. 1%), 72. 4% (95% CI = 53. 3% to 85. 8%), and 28. 7% (95% CI = 11. 1% to 56.
Case-control study	5%) of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 89. 4% (95% CI = 79. 1% to 95. 0%). Ever smoking, history of gastric ulcers, nitrite intake above the lowest quartile, and H. pylori infection were responsible for 18.
Case-control study	3% (95% CI = 6. 5% to 41. 8%), 9. 7% (95% CI = 5. 4% to 16. 8%), 40. 7% (95% CI = 23. 4% to 60. 7%), and 10. 4% (95% CI = 0. 3% to 79. 6%) of noncardia gastric adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 59. 0% (95% CI = 16. 2% to 91. 4%).
Case-control study	Conclusion: In this population, a few known risk factors account for a majority of esophageal and gastric cancers.
Case-control study	These results suggest that the incidence of these cancers may be decreased by reducing the prevalence of smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, and being overweight and by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Case-control study	Population attributable risks of esophageal and gastric cancers
Case series	Objectives: In addition to the high incidence of squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus among South African men, the neoplasm is also characterized by an exceptionally latent course and poor prognosis.
Case series	The aim of this study was to review a cohort of patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus presenting to the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town and evaluate patient and tumour characteristics for their role as prognostic markers for survival.
Case series	Methods: Information on patients was extracted from a database established and maintained over a 30-year period.
Case series	Information for the analysis included patient demographics, clinical symptoms at presentation, tumour characteristics and treatment decisions. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 applying chi-square and Kaplan-Meier tests.
Case series	Results: Data were available on 1868 patients. The majority of patients were Black African men and the predominant histology was squamous cell carcinoma. There were significant differences (P < 0.
Case series	05) in the survival of patients with respect to race (P < 0. 001), performance status (P < 0. 001), weight loss (P = 0. 001) and prior tuberculosis diagnosis (P = 0. 007).
Case series	Tumour characteristics that were significantly associated with survival were histological type, tumour size and site.
Case series	Gender, prior cancer, smoking status and tumour-related pain did not show significant association with survival in patients with oesophageal cancer. Only 19. 8% of the patients were candidates for potentially curative treatment.
Case series	Conclusions: This analysis shows that there are prominent patient and tumour characteristics that are significantly associated with survival with respect to oesophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The inclusion of these factors in the initial assessment of patients may assist with appropriate treatment decisions.
Case series	Patient and tumour characteristics as prognostic markers for oesophageal cancer: a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients at Groote Schuur Hospital
Case series	Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trends in patients' characteristics and comorbidities in esophageal cancer (EC) patients.
Case series	Background: Identifying changing pattern is essential to understand and predict further changes and to plan surgical procedures and resource allocation.
Case series	Methods: Trends in patients' characteristics and comorbidities were evaluated in 4440 EC patients at the Center for Esophageal Diseases in Padova, Italy, during 1980 to 2011.
Case series	Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to evaluate trends and to estimate annual percentage changes (APCs). Results: During the study period, there has been a statistically significant increment of the rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma (APC 3.
Case series	70). The rates of elderly and of asymptomatic patients increased over time (APCs 0. 98 and 6. 24), whereas the rates of malnutrition, alcoholic drinking, and gastric ulcer decreased (APCs -1. 50, -1. 72, and -5. 20).
Case series	Reflux rate increased until 1997 and decreased thereafter (APCs 6. 96 and -4. 48), whereas the rate of Barrett esophagus increased until 1992 (APC 35. 84) and then leveled. The rates of patients with previous neoplasms increased over time (APCs 3.
Case series	22 and 4. 86). There have been significant changes in systemic comorbidities, with an increase of hypertension and cardiac disease (APCs 7. 56 and 1. 86) and a decrease of advanced liver disease and pulmonary disease (APCs -2. 67 and -1. 74).
Case series	Conclusion: The current EC patient has more often an esophageal adenocarcinoma and is more frequently elderly, asymptomatic, a survivor of previous neoplasms, and a patient with hypertension and cardiac disease than 30 years ago.
Case series	On the contrary, malnutrition, alcoholic drinking, gastric ulcer, pulmonary disease, and advanced liver disease decreased.
Case series	Esophageal Cancer Clinical Presentation: Trends in the Last 3 Decades in a Large Italian Series
Case series	Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) tumor bleeding can vary from occult bleeding to massive hemorrhage and can be the presenting sign of malignancy.
Case series	Aims: Our primary aims were to: (1) characterize the natural history, treatment, and outcomes in patients with GI tumor bleeding and (2) compare and contrast bleeding in upper GI (UGI)/small bowel (SB) and lower GI malignancies.
Case series	Methods: Patients with endoscopically confirmed tumor bleeding were identified through search of consecutive electronic medical records: Bleeding was determined by the presence of melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, or fecal occult blood.
Case series	Comprehensive clinical and management data were abstracted. Results: A total of 354 patients with GI tumors were identified: 71 had tumor bleeding (42 UGI/SB and 29 colonic).
Case series	GI bleeding was the initial presenting symptom of malignancy in 55/71 (77%) of patients; 26/71 patients had widely metastatic disease at presentation. Further, 15 of 26 patients with metastatic disease presented with GI bleeding.
Case series	Visible bleeding was present in 14/42 (33%) and 4/29 (14%) of UGI/SB and colonic tumors, respectively. Endoscopic hemostasis was attempted in 10 patients, and although initial control was successful in all, bleeding recurred in all of these patients.
Case series	The most common endoscopic lesion was clean-based tumor ulceration. Overall mortality at 1 year was 57% for esophageal/gastric, 14% for SB, and 33% for colonic tumors.
Case series	Conclusions: When patients with GI malignancy present with GI bleeding, it is often the index symptom. Initial endoscopic hemostasis is often successful, but rebleeding is typical.
Case series	Esophageal and gastric tumors carry the poorest prognosis, with a high 1-year mortality rate.
Case series	Gastrointestinal Bleeding Due to Gastrointestinal Tract Malignancy: Natural History, Management, and Outcomes
Case series	Purpose: The aim of the authors in this study was to critically evaluate the role of whole-body positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in staging esophageal cancer, and further to compare this method with conventional imaging with computed tomography (CT).
Case series	Materials and methods: The authors performed independent, blinded retrospective evaluations of FDG PET images obtained in 47 patients referred for the initial staging of esophageal cancer before minimally invasive surgical staging.
Case series	Twenty PET studies from patients with nonesophageal thoracic cancers were randomly selected for inclusion in the PET readings.
Case series	In a subset of 37 of 47 cases, the PET findings were compared with independent readings of CT studies acquired within the same 6-week interval. The utility of the imaging findings was evaluated using a high-sensitivity interpretation (i. e.
Case series	, assigning equivocal findings as positive) and a low-sensitivity interpretation (i. e. , assigning equivocal findings as negative).
Case series	Results: PET was less sensitive (41% in high-sensitivity mode, 35% in low-sensitivity mode) than CT (63% to 87%) for diagnosing tumor involvement in locoregional lymph nodes, which was identified by surgical assessment in 72% of patients.
Case series	Notable, however, was the greater specificity of PET-determined nodal sites (to approximately 90%) compared with CT (14% to 43%).
Case series	In detecting histologically proved distant metastases (n = 10), PET performed considerably better when applied in the high-sensitivity mode, with a sensitivity rate of approximately 70% and a specificity rate of more than 90% in the total group and in the subset of patients with correlative CT data.
Case series	In the low-sensitivity mode, CT identified only two of seven metastatic sites, whereas the high-sensitivity mode resulted in an unacceptably high rate of false-positive readings (positive predictive value, 29%).
Case series	PET correctly identified one additional site of metastasis that was not detected by CT. Conclusions: The relatively low sensitivity of PET for identifying locoregional lesions precludes its replacement of conventional CT staging.
Case series	However, the primary advantage of PET imaging is its superior specificity for tumor detection and improved diagnostic value for distant metastatic sites, features that may substantially affect patient management decisions.
Case series	In conclusion, PET imaging is useful in the initial staging of esophageal cancer and provides additional and complementary information to that obtained by CT imaging.

review	The most common pattern of esophageal cancer metastases (ECM) is to the lymph nodes, lung, liver, bones, adrenal glands, and brain.
review	On the other hand, unexpected metastasis (UM) spread to uncommon sites has increasingly reported and consequently affected the pathway of diagnosis, staging, and management.
review	Using the PubMed database, a systematic search of the following headings "Esophageal" and "Metastasis" or "Metastases" was performed, 10049 articles were identified, and the articles were included if they demonstrated unexpected ECM.
review	84% of cases were men with an average age of 60. 7 years. EC was located in the lower third in 65%. Two-thirds of the UM originated from the lower esophagus, and the two major histological types were adenocarcinoma 40% and squamous cell carcinoma 60%.
review	Metastases were disseminated toward five main anatomical sites: the head and neck (42%), thoracic (17%), abdomen and pelvis (25%), extremities (9%), and multiple skin and muscle metastases (7%).
review	The EC metastases were found to be synchronous 42% and metachronous 58%, isolated in 53. 5% and multiple in 46. 5%. The overall survival rate was 10. 2 months.
review	Since distant metastases are responsible for most EC-related deaths, understanding of ECM dissemination patterns needs more extensive studies. These critical data are the cornerstone of optimal cancer approach and treatment.
review	Esophageal Cancer Metastases to Unexpected Sites: A Systematic Review
Cohort study	Importance: The management of cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) is controversial. The advantages of radiotherapy (RT) for CEC are lower rates of acute morbidity and mortality compared with surgery and potential for larynx preservation.
Cohort study	The advantage of surgery is that the transposed stomach may function better over the long term than an irradiated esophagus, which tends to become stenotic over time.
Cohort study	Which one is the primary treatment of CEC? Objective: To evaluate treatment outcomes of primary RT and primary surgery in patients with CEC.
Cohort study	Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective study conducted in a university hospital included 224 patients treated for CEC between 2001 and 2012.
Cohort study	Interventions: One hundred and sixty-one patients who received primary RT with or without subsequent surgery were assigned to the RT group, including 133 patients who received RT alone or RT with concurrent chemotherapy and 28 patients who received preoperative RT plus surgery.
Cohort study	Sixty-three patients who received primary surgery with or without subsequent RT were assigned to the primary surgery group, including 27 patients who received surgery alone and 36 patients who received surgery plus postoperative RT.
Cohort study	Main outcomes and measures: The rates of overall 2-year local failure-free survival (FFS), regional FFS, distant FFS, and overall survival for patients undergoing primary RT and primary surgery were compared.
Cohort study	A separate analysis using matched cases between the primary RT group and primary surgery group was conducted. Results: The median follow-up time was 15. 1 months.
Cohort study	The rates of overall 2-year local FFS, regional FFS, distant FFS, and overall survival for patients undergoing primary RT and primary surgery were 69. 9% and 68. 6%, 79. 5% and 69. 8%, 74. 3% and 62. 5%, 49. 3% and 50. 7%, respectively (P >.
Cohort study	05 for all). Matched-case analyses did not show any significant differences in measured survival rates between the treatment groups.
Cohort study	Conclusions and relevance: Given the similarities in rates of local FFS, regional FFS, distant FFS, and overall survival between the primary RT and primary surgery CEC treatment groups, we recommend primary RT for larynx preservation, with surgery offered subsequently for patients who do not respond to RT.
Cohort study	Primary radiotherapy compared with primary surgery in cervical esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Data on cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) based on modern radiotherapy technique are rare. We aimed to analyze the clinical efficacy and failure pattern of patients with CEC who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Methods: Between February 2002 and October 2013, 102 patients with CEC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed.
Case series	All patients received concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy with conformal radiotherapy (50-70 Gy in 25-35 fractions, 5 fractions per week over 5-7 weeks).
Case series	Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and loco-regional failure-free survival (LRFFS) were calculated. Results: The 3-year OS, PFS and LRFFS rates for the entire sample were 39. 3%, 33. 6% and 35. 3%, respectively.
Case series	During follow-up, 32, 26, and 41 patients had developed local, regional, and distant failure, respectively. Sex and hoarseness were independent prognostic indicators for OS (P=0. 011, P<0. 001; respectively) and PFS (P=0. 008, P=0. 001; respectively).
Case series	Hoarseness was the only independent prognostic factor for LRFFS (P=0. 002). Conclusions: Distant metastasis was the most common failure pattern in CEC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Hoarseness was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, and LRFFS.
Case series	Clinical efficacy and failure pattern in patients with cervical esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy
Case series	Background: Free jejunal transfer has become the standard technique for reconstruction of the pharynx and hypopharynx, especially with proximal neoplastic lesions, whereas gastric tube interposition is the technique of choice for reconstruction of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus when resection extends below the thoracic inlet.
Case series	Hypothesis: Surgical ablation is a viable option for advanced hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal neoplasms, with stomach interposition a safe and preferred method of reconstruction. Design: Retrospective analysis.
Case series	Setting: University hospital that is a regional referral institution for esophageal cancer treatment and complex digestive reconstructions after esophagectomy.
Case series	Patients: We reviewed the records of 209 patients who underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy between May 1982 and July 1999. The majority of patients had advanced cancer: hypopharyngeal in 131 cases and cervical esophageal in 78 cases.
Case series	Interventions: Pharyngolaryngectomy and total esophagectomy with pharyngogastric anastomoses (n = 127); pharyngolaryngectomy, cervical esophagectomy, and reconstruction with free jejunal transplant (n = 77); and pharyngolaryngectomy and total esophagectomy with pharyngocolic anastomoses (n = 5).
Case series	Main outcome measures: Postoperative mortality and morbidity, long-term survival, and prognostic factors influencing survival. Results: The postoperative in-hospital mortality rate was 4. 8% (10 patients), with a postoperative morbidity rate of 38.
Case series	3%. Alimentary continuity was achieved using the stomach (127 patients), colon (5 patients), or free jejunal autograft (77 patients). The 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 62% and 24%, respectively.
Case series	There was no significant difference with regard to the survival between gastric transposition and free jejunal autograft, but there were fewer complications in the gastric pull-up group (33% vs 47%, P<. 05).
Case series	The significant adverse factors affecting survival were tumor cervical localization, postoperative complications, disease stages pT3 and pT4 for the cervical esophageal tumors, microscopic pharyngeal penetration, or incomplete resection.
Case series	The significant beneficial factors were tumor hypopharyngeal localization and postoperative radiotherapy.
Case series	Conclusions: Surgical ablation is a viable option for advanced hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal neoplasms, with stomach interposition the preferred method of reconstruction.
Case series	Although the prognosis is poor, satisfactory short-term palliation can be achieved. The significant adverse factors affecting survival should be taken into account to select the candidates for surgery.
Case series	Surgical management of carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus: analysis of 209 cases
Case series	A prospective trial was performed in which biopsy and cytology specimens were obtained on 202 consecutive patients including 47 with esophageal or gastric carcinomas.
Case series	The first biopsy specimen yielded a correct diagnosis in the majority of instances: 70% of gastric carcinomas and 93% of esophageal carcinomas.
Case series	Three additional biopsy specimens increased the yield to greater than 95%, a total of seven biopsy specimens yielded greater than 98%. Seven biopsy and cytology specimens yielded the correct diagnosis in all patients.
Case series	Seventeen percent of all lesions subsequently proven to be malignant were thought to be benign, endoscopically.
Case series	This reinforces the belief that all lesions seen at endoscopy should have biopsies performed and at least seven specimens should be obtained.
Case series	Prospective evaluation of biopsy number in the diagnosis of esophageal and gastric carcinoma
Case series	Background: Previous American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer (AJCC/UICC) stage groupings for esophageal cancer have not been data driven or harmonized with stomach cancer.
Case series	At the request of the AJCC, worldwide data from 3 continents were assembled to develop data-driven, harmonized esophageal staging for the seventh edition of the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals.
Case series	Methods: All-cause mortality among 4627 patients with esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer who underwent surgery alone (no preoperative or postoperative adjuvant therapy) was analyzed by using novel random forest methodology to produce stage groups for which survival was monotonically decreasing, distinctive, and homogeneous.
Case series	Results: For lymph node-negative pN0M0 cancers, risk-adjusted 5-year survival was dominated by pathologic tumor classification (pT) but was modulated by histopathologic cell type, histologic grade, and location.
Case series	For lymph node-positive, pN+M0 cancers, the number of cancer-positive lymph nodes (a new pN classification) dominated survival. Resulting stage groupings departed from a simple, logical arrangement of TNM.
Case series	Stage groupings for stage I and II adenocarcinoma were based on pT, pN, and histologic grade; and groupings for squamous cell carcinoma were based on pT, pN, histologic grade, and location.
Case series	Stage III was similar for histopathologic cell types and was based only on pT and pN. Stage 0 and stage IV, by definition, were categorized as tumor in situ (Tis) (high-grade dysplasia) and pM1, respectively.
Case series	Conclusions: The prognosis for patients with esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer depends on the complex interplay of TNM classifications as well as nonanatomic factors, including histopathologic cell type, histologic grade, and cancer location.
Case series	These features were incorporated into a data-driven staging of these cancers for the seventh edition of the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals.
Case series	Cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction: data-driven staging for the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer Cancer Staging Manuals
Case series	To address uncertainty of whether clinical stage groupings (cTNM) for esophageal cancer share prognostic implications with pathologic groupings after esophagectomy alone (pTNM), we report data-simple descriptions of patient characteristics, cancer categories, and non-risk-adjusted survival-for clinically staged patients from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration (WECC).
Case series	Thirty-three institutions from six continents submitted data using variables with standard definitions: demographics, comorbidities, clinical cancer categories, and all-cause mortality from first management decision.
Case series	Of 22,123 clinically staged patients, 8,156 had squamous cell carcinoma, 13,814 adenocarcinoma, 116 adenosquamous carcinoma, and 37 undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients were older (62 years) men (80%) with normal body mass index (18.
Case series	5-25 mg/kg2 , 47%), little weight loss (2. 4 ± 7. 8 kg), 0-1 ECOG performance status (67%), and history of smoking (67%). Cancers were cT1 (12%), cT2 (22%), cT3 (56%), cN0 (44%), cM0 (95%), and cG2-G3 (89%); most involved the distal esophagus (73%).
Case series	Non-risk-adjusted survival for squamous cell carcinoma was not distinctive for early cT or cN; for adenocarcinoma, it was distinctive for early versus advanced cT and for cN0 versus cN+.
Case series	Patients with early cancers had worse survival and those with advanced cancers better survival than expected from equivalent pathologic categories based on prior WECC pathologic data.
Case series	Thus, clinical and pathologic categories do not share prognostic implications. This makes clinically based treatment decisions difficult and pre-treatment prognostication inaccurate.
Case series	These data will be the basis for the 8th edition cancer staging manuals following risk adjustment for patient characteristics, cancer categories, and treatment characteristics and should direct 9th edition data collection.
Case series	Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration: clinical staging data
Case series	To address uncertainty of whether pathologic stage groupings after neoadjuvant therapy (ypTNM) for esophageal cancer share prognostic implications with pathologic groupings after esophagectomy alone (pTNM), we report data-simple descriptions of patient characteristics, cancer categories, and non-risk-adjusted survival-for pathologically staged cancers after neoadjuvant therapy from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration (WECC).
Case series	Thirty-three institutions from six continents submitted data using variables with standard definitions: demographics, comorbidities, clinical cancer categories, and all-cause mortality from first management decision.
Case series	Of 7,773 pathologically staged neoadjuvant patients, 2,045 had squamous cell carcinoma, 5,686 adenocarcinoma, 31 adenosquamous carcinoma, and 11 undifferentiated carcinoma.
Case series	Patients were older (61 years) men (83%) with normal (40%) or overweight (35%) body mass index, 0-1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (96%), and a history of smoking (69%).
Case series	Cancers were ypT0 (20%), ypT1 (13%), ypT2 (18%), ypT3 (44%), ypN0 (55%), ypM0 (94%), and G2-G3 (72%); most involved the distal esophagus (80%).
Case series	Non-risk-adjusted survival for yp categories was unequally depressed, more for earlier categories than later, compared with equivalent categories from prior WECC data for esophagectomy-alone patients.
Case series	Thus, survival of patients with ypT0-2N0M0 cancers was intermediate and similar regardless of ypT; survival for ypN+ cancers was poor.
Case series	Because prognoses for ypTNM and pTNM categories are dissimilar, prognostication should be based on separate ypTNM categories and groupings.
Case series	These data will be the basis for the 8th edition cancer staging manuals following risk adjustment for patient, cancer, and treatment characteristics and should direct 9th edition data collection.
Case series	Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration: neoadjuvant pathologic staging data
Case series	We report data-simple descriptions of patient characteristics, cancer categories, and non-risk-adjusted survival-for patients with pathologically staged cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction after resection or ablation with no preoperative therapy from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration (WECC).
Case series	Thirty-three institutions from six continents submitted de-identified data using standard definitions: demographics, comorbidities, clinical cancer categories, and all-cause mortality from first management decision.
Case series	Of 13,300 patients, 5,631 had squamous cell carcinoma, 7,558 adenocarcinoma, 85 adenosquamous carcinoma, and 26 undifferentiated carcinoma. Patients were older (62 years) men (80%) with normal body mass index (51%), little weight loss (1.
Case series	8 kg), 0-2 ECOG performance status (83%), and a history of smoking (70%). Cancers were pT1 (24%), pT2 (15%), pT3 (50%), pN0 (52%), pM0 (93%), and pG2-G3 (78%); most involved distal esophagus (71%).
Case series	Non-risk-adjusted survival for both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma was monotonic and distinctive across pTNM. Survival was more distinctive for adenocarcinoma than squamous cell carcinoma when pT was ordered by pN.
Case series	Survival for pTis-1 adenocarcinoma was better than for squamous cell carcinoma, although monotonic and distinctive for both.
Case series	WECC pathologic staging data is improved over that of the 7th edition, with more patients studied and patient and cancer variables collected.
Case series	These data will be the basis for the 8th edition cancer staging manuals following risk adjustment for patient, cancer, and treatment characteristics, and should direct 9th edition data collection.
Case series	However, the role of pure pathologic staging as the principal point of reference for esophageal cancer staging is waning.
Case series	Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration: pathologic staging data
Case series	We report analytic and consensus processes that produced recommendations for neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups (ypTNM) of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer for the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals, 8th edition.
Case series	The Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration provided data for 22,654 patients with epithelial esophageal cancers; 7,773 had pathologic assessment after neoadjuvant therapy. Risk-adjusted survival for each patient was developed.
Case series	Random forest analysis identified data-driven neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups wherein survival decreased monotonically with increasing group, was distinctive between groups, and homogeneous within groups.
Case series	An additional analysis produced data-driven anatomic neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups based only on ypT, ypN, and ypM categories.
Case series	The AJCC Upper GI Task Force, by smoothing, simplifying, expanding, and assessing clinical applicability, produced consensus neoadjuvant pathologic stage groups. Grade and location were much less discriminating for stage grouping ypTNM than pTNM.
Case series	Data-driven stage grouping without grade and location produced nearly identical groups for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. However, ypTNM groups and their associated survival differed from pTNM. The need for consensus process was minimal.
Case series	The consensus groups, identical for both cell types were as follows: ypStage I comprised ypT0-2N0M0; ypStage II ypT3N0M0; ypStage IIIA ypT0-2N1M0; ypStage IIIB ypT3N1M0, ypT0-3N2, and ypT4aN0M0; ypStage IVA ypT4aN1-2, ypT4bN0-2, and ypTanyN3M0; and ypStage IVB ypTanyNanyM1.
Case series	Absence of equivalent pathologic (pTNM) categories for the peculiar neoadjuvant pathologic categories ypTisN0-3M0 and ypT0N0-3M0, dissimilar stage group compositions, and markedly different early- and intermediate-stage survival necessitated a unified, unique set of stage grouping for patients of either cell type who receive neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Recommendations for neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypTNM) of cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction for the 8th edition AJCC/UICC staging manuals
Case series	We report analytic and consensus processes that produced recommendations for clinical stage groups (cTNM) of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer for the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals, 8th edition.
Case series	The Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration (WECC) provided data on 22,123 clinically staged patients with epithelial esophageal cancers.
Case series	Risk-adjusted survival for each patient was developed using random survival forest analysis from which (1) data-driven clinical stage groups were identified wherein survival decreased monotonically and was distinctive between and homogeneous within groups and (2) data-driven anatomic clinical stage groups based only on cTNM.
Case series	The AJCC Upper GI Task Force, by smoothing, simplifying, expanding, and assessing clinical applicability, produced (3) consensus clinical stage groups.
Case series	Compared with pTNM, cTNM survival was "pinched," with poorer survival for early cStage groups and better survival for advanced ones.
Case series	Histologic grade was distinctive for data-driven grouping of cT2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cT1-2N0M0 adenocarcinoma, but consensus removed it. Grouping was different by histopathologic cell type.
Case series	For SCC, cN0-1 was distinctive for cT3 but not cT1-2, and consensus removed cT4 subclassification and added subgroups 0, IVA, and IVB.
Case series	For adenocarcinoma, N0-1 was distinctive for cT1-2 but not cT3-4a, cStage II subgrouping was necessary (T1N1M0 [IIA] and T2N0M0 [IIB]), advanced cancers cT3-4aN0-1M0 plus cT2N1M0 comprised cStage III, and consensus added subgroups 0, IVA, and IVB.
Case series	Treatment decisions require accurate cStage, which differs from pStage.
Case series	Understaging and overstaging are problematic, and additional factors, such as grade, may facilitate treatment decisions and prognostication until clinical staging techniques are uniformly applied and improved.
Case series	Recommendations for clinical staging (cTNM) of cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction for the 8th edition AJCC/UICC staging manuals
Case series	We report analytic and consensus processes that produced recommendations for pathologic stage groups (pTNM) of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer for the AJCC/UICC cancer staging manuals, 8th edition.
Case series	The Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration provided data for 22,654 patients with epithelial esophageal cancers; 13,300 without preoperative therapy had pathologic assessment after esophagectomy or endoscopic treatment.
Case series	Risk-adjusted survival for each patient was developed using random survival forest analysis to identify data-driven pathologic stage groups wherein survival decreased monotonically with increasing group, was distinctive between groups, and homogeneous within groups.
Case series	The AJCC Upper GI Task Force, by smoothing, simplifying, expanding, and assessing clinical applicability, produced consensus pathologic stage groups.
Case series	For pT1-3N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and pT1-2N0M0 adenocarcinoma, pT was inadequate for grouping; subcategorizing pT1 and adding histologic grade enhanced staging; cancer location improved SCC staging.
Case series	Consensus eliminated location for pT2N0M0 and pT3N0M0G1 SCC groups, and despite similar survival, restricted stage 0 to pTis, excluding pT1aN0M0G1. Metastases markedly reduced survival; pT, pN, and pM sufficiently grouped advanced cancers.
Case series	Stage IIA and IIB had different compositions for SCC and adenocarcinoma, but similar survival. Consensus stage IV subgrouping acknowledged pT4N+ and pN3 cancers had poor survival, similar to pM1.
Case series	Anatomic pathologic stage grouping, based on pTNM only, produced identical consensus stage groups for SCC and adenocarcinoma at the cost of homogeneity in early groups.
Case series	Pathologic staging can neither direct pre-treatment decisions nor aid in prognostication for treatment other than esophagectomy or endoscopic therapy. However, it provides a clean, single therapy reference point for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Recommendations for pathologic staging (pTNM) of cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction for the 8th edition AJCC/UICC staging manuals
Case series	Purpose: In patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, pathologic complete response (pCR), and estimated treatment response are various means used to stratify patients prognostically after surgery.
Case series	However, none of these methods has been formally evaluated. The purpose of this study was to establish prognostic pathologic variables after CRT.
Case series	Patients and methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received CRT before esophagectomy. Data collected included demographics, CRT details, pathologic findings, and survival.
Case series	Statistical methods included recursive partitioning and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results: Two hundred seventy-six patients were appropriate for this analysis.
Case series	Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates that the current AJCC system poorly distinguishes between stages 0 to IIA (P =. 52), IIB to III (P =. 87), and IVA to IVB (P =. 30). The presence of a pCR conferred improved survival over residual disease (P =. 01).
Case series	Recursive partitioning analysis indicates that involved lymph nodes and metastatic disease are the best predictors of survival and that depth of invasion and degree of treatment response are less predictive.
Case series	Conclusion: The current AJCC staging system is not a good predictor of survival after CRT.
Case series	Although patients with a pCR do have improved long-term survival relative to patients with residual disease, this method places too much emphasis on residual depth of invasion and fails to identify patients with residual disease who have good long-term survival.
Case series	Recursive partitioning analysis more accurately identifies nodal disease and metastatic disease as the most important prognostic variables. Degree of treatment response is less prognostic than nodal involvement.
Case series	American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system does not accurately predict survival in patients receiving multimodality therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma
Case series	Background: In patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent preoperative chemoradiation, it is unclear whether survival was better predicted by pretherapy clinical stage or by posttherapy pathologic stage.
Case series	Methods: The authors studied 235 consecutive patients with pretherapy clinical Stage II, III, or IVA (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria) carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who were treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy.
Case series	Posttherapy cancer status was classified using pathologic stage and semiquantitative assessment of residual carcinoma.
Case series	Clinicopathologic features, residual carcinoma status, and pretherapy and posttherapy stage were compared with disease-free and overall survival.
Case series	Results: Posttherapy pathologic stage was Stage 0 in 29% of patients, Stage I in 11% of patients, Stage II in 34% of patients, Stage III in 20% of patients, and Stage IV in 6% of patients. Cancer downstaging occurred in 56% of patients.
Case series	In univariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P < 0. 001), margin status (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 01, respectively), extent of residual carcinoma (both with P < 0.
Case series	001), and downstaging (both with P = 0. 001), but not by age, gender, type of cancer, pretherapy clinical stage, or preoperative regimen.
Case series	However, in multivariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were independently predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P = 0. 02). Extent of residual carcinoma was a marginally significant predictor of overall survival (P = 0.
Case series	04). Conclusions: Posttherapy pathologic stage was the best available predictor of outcome for patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent chemoradiation therapy followed by esophagectomy.
Case series	The findings in the current study supported the concept of downstaging by preoperative therapy.
Case series	Posttherapy pathologic stage predicts survival in patients with esophageal carcinoma receiving preoperative chemoradiation
Case series	Background: The purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that a lower clinical TNM stage is associated with a higher rate of pathologic complete response (pathCR) in patients with esophageal carcinoma receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy and to determine whether outcome after pathCR is related to clinical stage or treatment.
Case series	Methods: Clinical parameters and surgical specimens of patients with esophageal carcinoma undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy were analyzed to identify predictors of pathCR.
Case series	In patients with pathCR, predictors of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and distant recurrence were studied. Results: Sixty-nine (29%) of 235 patients achieved pathCR.
Case series	In patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage II carcinoma, the proportion achieving pathCR was significantly larger than that achieving <pathCR (65% vs. 35%; P = 0. 03).
Case series	The proportion of patients who received induction chemotherapy was higher in the pathCR group than in the <pathCR group (54% vs. 46%; P = 0. 05).
Case series	However, neither TNM classification, primary tumor location, histologic type, gender, therapy sequence, or radiation dose (45 grays [Gy] vs. 50. 4 Gy) were found to have any influence on OS or DFS.
Case series	The median OS from pathCR was significantly longer than that from <pathCR (133 mos vs. 34 mos; P = 0. 002). Similarly, DFS was longer in the pathCR group than in the <pathCR (P = 0. 001).
Case series	Conclusions: Patients with clinical AJCC Stage II esophageal carcinoma are more likely to achieve a pathCR after preoperative chemoradiotherapy than are those with Stage III carcinoma.
Case series	Chemoradiotherapy as primary therapy for patients with Stage I esophageal carcinoma warrants investigation as a means to preserve their esophagus.
Case series	Characterization of pathologic complete response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in carcinoma of the esophagus and outcome after pathologic complete response
Case series	Background: Thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis.
Case series	The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM cancer staging system focusing on the effect of regional (N1) and nonregional lymph node (M1a and M1b) metastasis may need reappraisal.
Case series	We investigated the role of the number of dissected and positive nodes in TESCC patients. Methods: A total of 109 TESCC patients (97 men; mean age of 62. 3 years) who underwent surgical resection were retrospectively analyzed.
Case series	The current AJCC TNM system and other lymph node classifications were used to subgroup these patients and analyze survival differences. Previously reported prognostic factors were evaluated.
Case series	Results: Patients with positive lymph node metastasis had a poor prognosis (p < 0. 001). There was a significant difference in survival among the 67 node-positive patients subdivided into subgroups with 1 to 3 and 4 or more positive nodes (p = 0.
Case series	004). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified four independent prognostic factors: difficulty in swallowing (p = 0. 024), cigarette smoking (p = 0. 003), number of positive lymph nodes (0, 1 to 3, and > or = 4; p < 0.
Case series	001), and gastric cardia invasion (p = 0. 012). Total dissection of at least 20 lymph nodes was the minimal requirement to achieve accurate nodal staging.
Case series	Conclusions: Dissection of more than 20 lymph nodes is mandatory in TESCC patients to achieve accurate staging. Positive lymph node metastasis of 4 or higher is a significant independent prognostic factor.
Case series	Prognostic variables in thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether the risk of systemic disease after esophagectomy can be predicted by the number of involved lymph nodes.
Case series	Summary background data: Primary esophagectomy is curative in some but not all patients with esophageal cancer. Identification of patients at high risk for systemic disease would allow selective use of additional systemic therapy.
Case series	This study is a multinational, retrospective review of patients treated with resection alone to assess the impact of the number of involved lymph nodes on the probability of systemic disease.
Case series	Methods: The study population included 1,053 patients with esophageal cancer (700 adenocarcinoma, 353 squamous carcinoma) who underwent R0 esophagectomy with > or =15 lymph nodes resected at 9 international centers: Asia (1), Europe (5), and United States (3).
Case series	To ensure a minimum potential follow-up of 5 years, only patients who had esophagectomy before October 2002 were included. Patients treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy were excluded.
Case series	The impact of the number of involved lymph nodes on the risk of systemic disease recurrence was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Systemic disease occurred in 40%.
Case series	The number of involved lymph nodes ranged from 0 to 26 with 55% of patients having at least 1 involved lymph node.
Case series	The frequency of systemic disease after esophagectomy was 16% for those without nodal involvement and progressively increased to 93% in patients with 8 or more involved lymph nodes.
Case series	Conclusions: This study shows that the number of involved lymph nodes can be used to predict the likelihood of systemic disease in patients with esophageal cancer.
Case series	The probability of systemic disease exceeds 50% when 3 or more nodes are involved and approaches 100% when the number of involved nodes is 8 or more. Additional therapy is warranted in these patients with a high probability of systemic disease.
Case series	Predicting systemic disease in patients with esophageal cancer after esophagectomy: a multinational study on the significance of the number of involved lymph nodes
Case series	To study the influence of the number of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) on survival and International Union Against Cancer tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification for esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The clinicopathological data on 1146 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had undergone an esophagectomy were retrospectively studied. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Case series	By subclassifying the nodes (N) category according to the number of metastatic LNs as: N0 for no LN metastases; N1(1) for only one positive node; and N1(2) for >or=2 positive nodes.
Case series	TNM staging was refined as stage IIa (T2-3N0M0), stage IIb (T1N1M0 and T2N1(1)M0), stage IIIa (T2N1(2)M0 and T3N1(1)M0), and stage IIIb (T3N1(2)M0 and T4NanyM0), and the survival was analyzed. LN metastases was found in 380 of 1146 (33.
Case series	2%) treated esophageal cancer patients. In 4270 LNs harvested, metastases was detected in 807 (18. 9%). The 5-year survival rates of the patients with 0, 1, and >or=2 positive nodes were 59. 8, 33. 4, and 9. 4%, respectively.
Case series	There was statistically significant difference among these three groups. The 5-year survival of the patients in stages T2N1M0 and T3N1M0 was significantly higher in the N1(1) group than in the N1(2) group (41. 5 vs 24. 1%, and 31. 2 vs 6. 8%, P<0.
Case series	001). The 5-year survival rates of the patients in refined stage IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb were 57. 1, 42. 2, 28. 6, and 8. 5%, with significant difference existing in each stage groups.
Case series	The number of positive LNs significantly influenced survival of the patients with esophageal cancer. Three grade classification (0, 1, >or=2 positive nodes) could quite well demonstrate the effect of the number of LN metastases and the survival.
Case series	The refined TNM classification based on the number of LN metastases could better reflect the prognosis of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Our results offer a strong rationale for refining the International Union Against Cancer TNM classification for esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The number of lymph node metastases influences survival and International Union Against Cancer tumor-node-metastasis classification for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Objective: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for esophageal cancer is controversial because it relies on arbitrary definitions of the anatomic location of lymph nodes to establish N and M status.
Case series	It has been proposed that the number of involved lymph nodes may better predict survival. We reviewed our experience to determine the prognostic impact of the number of involved nodes and the extent of lymphadenectomy on the current staging system.
Case series	Methods: Records of all patients who underwent resection of previously untreated adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction were reviewed.
Case series	Overall survival according to the AJCC staging system and the number of involved lymph nodes was analyzed by the method of Kaplan and Meier and by recursive partitioning methods.
Case series	Results: Data were available on 336 patients operated on between January 1996 and September 2003. Recursive partitioning analysis using AJCC staging variables reproduced the AJCC staging system.
Case series	When the number of involved lymph nodes is added, patients with more than 4 involved lymph nodes have survival similar to that of patients with M1 disease, and patients with no involved lymph nodes have the best prognosis.
Case series	Recursive partitioning analysis identified 18 lymph nodes as the minimal number required for accurate staging. In patients who have 18 or more lymph nodes removed, survival is only predicted by the presence of nodal involvement and M1 disease.
Case series	Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that revisions of the current AJCC staging system for esophageal cancer should include N staging based on the number of involved lymph nodes and minimal requirements for the extent of lymphadenectomy.
Case series	The prognostic importance of the number of involved lymph nodes in esophageal cancer: implications for revisions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system
Cohort study	Objective: To investigate whether the number of lymph nodes metastasis (LNMs) and the ratio between metastatic and examined lymph nodes (LNs) are better prognostic factors when compared with traditional staging systems in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Cohort study	Summary background data: The accuracy of the 6th UICC/TNM classification is suboptimal, especially when not taking into account neoadjuvant therapy and lymphadenectomy extent.
Cohort study	Methods: For 536 patients who underwent curative en bloc esophagectomy, in whom 51.
Cohort study	5% (n = 276) received neoadjuvant chemoradiation, LNMs were classified according to the 6th UICC/TNM classification and systems based on the number (< or =4 and >4) or the ratio (< or =0. 2 and >0. 2) of LNMs.
Cohort study	Survival of the respective stages, predictors of survival, and influence of both chemoradiation and number of examined LNs were studied.
Cohort study	Results: After a median follow-up of 50 months, the 5-year survival rates were 47% for the entire population, significantly poorer for patients with >4 LNMs (8% vs. 53%, P < 0. 001) or a ratio of LNMs >0. 2 (22% vs. 54%, P < 0. 001).
Cohort study	After adjustment for confounding variables, a number of LNMs >4 and a ratio of LNMs >0. 2 were the only predictors of poor prognosis.
Cohort study	The prognostic role of both the number and the ratio of LNMs was maintained whether patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation or not.
Cohort study	Moreover, LN ratio is shown to be more accurate for inadequately staged patients (<15 examined LNs), whereas the number of LNMs is pertinent for adequately staged patients (> or =15 examined LNs).
Cohort study	Conclusion: Staging systems for esophageal cancer that use the number (< or =4 or >4) and the ratio (< or =0. 2 or >0.
Cohort study	2) of LNMs have greater prognostic importance than the current staging systems because of the good stratification of the groups and their clinical utility, taking into account neoadjuvant therapy and lymphadenectomy extent.
Cohort study	The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the ratio between metastatic and examined lymph nodes are independent prognostic factors in esophageal cancer regardless of neoadjuvant chemoradiation or lymphadenectomy extent
Case series	Purpose: To investigate the importance of lymph node yield (LNY) and the ratio of afflicted lymph nodes in esophageal carcinoma patients. Patients and methods: Between 1992 and 2004, 368 patients with esophageal carcinoma underwent surgery.
Case series	Esophagectomy with curative intent was performed in 255 patients. Subtotal esophagectomy was performed either by thoracoabdominal (104 patients, 40. 8%) or by transhiatal approach (151 patients, 59. 2%).
Case series	Results: According to the LNY, patients were grouped into 3 groups. Twenty-six patients had < or =5, 96 had 6 to 18, and 113 had > or =19 dissected lymph nodes.
Case series	In patients with nodal involvement (pN1), no significant overall survival differences were identified when stratifying subgroups according to the LNY. However, LNY had striking prognostic relevance in pN0 patients.
Case series	The median overall survival was 23 (< or =5 LN), 36 (6-18 LN), and 88 months (> or =19).
Case series	Even for patients with tripled LNY than the proposed minimum by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) (18 LN), the rate of patients with detected lymph node metastases was only 46%, compared with 61% for patients with a LNY of > or =19 (P = 0.
Case series	002). In pN1 patients classified according to the ratio of afflicted lymph nodes, median overall survival was 27 months in patients with a ratio <11%, compared with 15 and 13 months in patients with a ratio of 11% to 33% and >33%, respectively (P < 0.
Case series	001). Multivariate Cox regression modeling identified ratio as the strongest independent prognostic factor for overall survival in pN1 and the LNY in pN0 patients.
Case series	Conclusions: The minimal regional LNY of 6 lymph nodes as recommended by the UICC for esophageal carcinoma is far too low to appropriately stage the disease. The LNY and the ratio should be reflected in the next version of the UICC classification.
Case series	Is it time for a new TNM classification in esophageal carcinoma?
meta analysis	Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the staging of esophageal cancer. Methods: Only EUS studies confirmed by surgery were selected. Articles were searched in Medline and Pubmed.
meta analysis	Two reviewers independently searched and extracted data. Meta-analysis of the accuracy of EUS was analyzed by calculating pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio.
meta analysis	Pooling was conducted by both the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed effects model) and DerSimonian Laird method (random effects model). The heterogeneity of studies was tested using Cochran's Q test based upon inverse variance weights.
meta analysis	Results: Forty-nine studies (n = 2558) which met the inclusion criteria were included in this analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS to diagnose T1 was 81. 6% (95% CI: 77. 8-84. 9) and 99. 4% (95% CI: 99. 0-99. 7), respectively.
meta analysis	To diagnose T4, EUS had a pooled sensitivity of 92. 4% (95% CI: 89. 2-95. 0) and specificity of 97. 4% (95% CI: 96. 6-98. 0). With Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), sensitivity of EUS to diagnose N stage improved from 84. 7% (95% CI: 82. 9-86. 4) to 96.
meta analysis	7% (95% CI: 92. 4-98. 9). The P value for the c2 test of heterogeneity for all pooled estimates was > 0. 10. Conclusion: EUS has excellent sensitivity and specificity in accurately diagnosing the TN stage of esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	EUS performs better with advanced (T4) than early (T1) disease. FNA substantially improves the sensitivity and specificity of EUS in evaluating N stage disease. EUS should be strongly considered for staging esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Staging accuracy of esophageal cancer by endoscopic ultrasound: a meta-analysis and systematic review
Case series	Background: Patients with carcinoma of the distal esophagus and metastatic celiac lymph nodes (M1a) have a poor prognosis and are often denied surgery.
Case series	In this study, we evaluated our treatment strategy of chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with M1a disease.
Case series	Methods: Thirty-eight patients who received chemotherapy for carcinoma of the distal esophagus with celiac lymph node involvement between 2000 and 2007 were identified from a prospective database.
Case series	Clinical and histopathological responses to chemotherapy were analyzed and follow-up comprised review of medical charts. Results: Twelve non-responding patients were not eligible for surgery.
Case series	Twenty-six patients with partial responses or stable disease were operated on. The resectability rate was 96% (25/26) and tumor-free resection margins (R0) were achieved in 68% (17/25). The overall survival of patients with M1a disease was 16 months.
Case series	Patients who received chemotherapy alone had a median survival of 10 months; patients who underwent additional surgery had a median survival of 26 months (log-rank P < 0. 001).
Case series	Conclusion: The overall survival of patients with carcinoma of the distal esophagus and clinical celiac lymph node involvement is poor.
Case series	Tumor-free resection margins (R0) in M1a patients with clinical response to chemotherapy are likely to be achieved and contributes to prolonged survival.
Case series	Chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with carcinoma of the distal esophagus and celiac lymph node involvement
Case series	Background: Bronchoscopy is frequently used to assess invasion of esophageal cancer into the tracheobronchial tree. Prospective studies evaluating the role of bronchoscopy in pretherapeutic staging of esophageal cancer are lacking.
Case series	Study objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of fiberoptic bronchoscopy for the assessment of airway involvement by esophageal carcinoma and its resectability.
Case series	Patients and methods: In a prospective study, we analyzed 150 bronchoscopies in 116 consecutive patients with potentially operable esophageal carcinoma, and correlated the findings with other staging modalities, intraoperative evaluation, and histopathologic data.
Case series	Results: One unknown additional bronchial cancer was found.
Case series	In 32% of bronchoscopies performed in patients with esophageal cancer located above the tracheal bifurcation, some macroscopic abnormality was detected in the trachea and main bronchi, with mobile protrusion of the posterior tracheal wall being the most frequent abnormality (20.
Case series	7%). When compared with histologic results, normal macroscopic appearance of the trachea and main bronchi had a negative predictive value of 98.
Case series	5%, but the positive predictive value of all macroscopic abnormalities for the diagnosis of airway involvement was low, particularly after radiation therapy.
Case series	The overall accuracy of bronchoscopy with multiple brush cytology and biopsy sampling in proving or excluding airway invasion in patients with otherwise operable conditions was 95. 8% (95% confidence interval, 88. 3 to 99. 1%).
Case series	Bronchoscopy was the sole decisive staging procedure, resulting in exclusion from surgery because of airway invasion, in 9. 7% of patients with otherwise potentially operable conditions.
Case series	The results of bronchoscopy and CT were discordant in 40% of the patients; the specificity and positive predictive value were higher for bronchoscopy than for CT.
Case series	Conclusions: When performed as the last investigation in the staging workup, bronchoscopy with biopsy and brush cytology is a very accurate procedure in evaluating possible airway invasion of esophageal cancer; macroscopic findings alone are not reliable.
Case series	Preoperative bronchoscopic assessment of airway invasion by esophageal cancer: a prospective study
meta analysis	The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in staging of oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	PubMed was searched to identify English-language articles published before January 2006 and reporting on diagnostic performance of EUS, CT, and/or FDG-PET in oesophageal cancer patients.
meta analysis	Articles were included if absolute numbers of true-positive, false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative test results were available or derivable for regional, celiac, and abdominal lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases.
meta analysis	Sensitivities and specificities were pooled using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to study potential effects of study and patient characteristics.
meta analysis	Random effects pooled sensitivities of EUS, CT, and FDG-PET for regional lymph node metastases were 0. 80 (95% confidence interval 0. 75-0. 84), 0. 50 (0. 41-0. 60), and 0. 57 (0. 43-0. 70), respectively, and specificities were 0. 70 (0. 65-0. 75), 0.
meta analysis	83 (0. 77-0. 89), and 0. 85 (0. 76-0. 95), respectively. Diagnostic performance did not differ significantly across these tests. For detection of celiac lymph node metastases by EUS, sensitivity and specificity were 0. 85 (0. 72-0. 99) and 0. 96 (0.
meta analysis	92-1. 00), respectively. For abdominal lymph node metastases by CT, these values were 0. 42 (0. 29-0. 54) and 0. 93 (0. 86-1. 00), respectively. For distant metastases, sensitivity and specificity were 0. 71 (0. 62-0. 79) and 0. 93 (0. 89-0.
meta analysis	97) for FDG-PET and 0. 52 (0. 33-0. 71) and 0. 91 (0. 86-0. 96) for CT, respectively.
meta analysis	Diagnostic performance of FDG-PET for distant metastases was significantly higher than that of CT, which was not significantly affected by study and patient characteristics.
meta analysis	The results suggest that EUS, CT, and FDG-PET each play a distinctive role in the detection of metastases in oesophageal cancer patients.
meta analysis	For the detection of regional lymph node metastases, EUS is most sensitive, whereas CT and FDG-PET are more specific tests. For the evaluation of distant metastases, FDG-PET has probably a higher sensitivity than CT.
meta analysis	Its combined use could however be of clinical value, with FDG-PET detecting possible metastases and CT confirming or excluding their presence and precisely determining the location(s).
meta analysis	Staging investigations for oesophageal cancer: a meta-analysis
Case series	Background: Conventional CT is insensitive for detection of metastatic involvement of celiac lymph nodes in esophageal cancer.
Case series	Helical CT has theoretical advantages over "slice" CT in this regard, but its performance has not yet been prospectively studied. Methods: Consecutive patients with untreated esophageal cancer were recruited after obtaining informed consent.
Case series	Helical CT was performed on all patients and TNM staging was performed by a single radiologist.
Case series	Subsequently, all patients underwent esophageal radial and, as needed, curvilinear array EUS with fine needle aspiration (FNA), for evaluation of celiac lymph nodes and TNM staging.
Case series	Test performance characteristics with 95% confidence intervals were calculated, assuming EUS with FNA as the reference standard. Results: Forty-eight patients were recruited, of whom 37 (77%) were men. The mean (SD) age was 63. 6 (10) years.
Case series	Excluding 5 patients in whom a confirmatory FNA was not available (n = 43), helical CT identified celiac lymph nodes in 12 (28%) patients.
Case series	The reference standard of EUS with FNA identified 15 (35%) patients with metastatic celiac lymph nodes, giving a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for helical CT of 53% (95% CI [28%, 79%]), 86% (95% CI [73%, 99%]), 67% (95% CI [40%, 93%]), and 77% (95% CI [63%, 92%]), respectively, for assessing celiac lymph nodal involvement.
Case series	The sensitivity and specificity of helical CT in detecting T4 disease were 25% (95% CI [3. 8%, 46%]) and 94% (95% CI [85%, 100%]), respectively.
Case series	There were 12 patients (25%; 95% CI [13%, 37%]) who were felt to have resectable disease by helical CT but had either metastatic involvement of celiac lymph nodes or T4 disease by EUS/FNA.
Case series	Conclusions: Despite technological advances, helical CT still appears unreliable, mainly because of insensitivity, for the identification of inoperable T4 or metastatic involvement of celiac lymph node disease in esophageal cancer.
Case series	Helical CT versus EUS with fine needle aspiration for celiac nodal assessment in patients with esophageal cancer
Case series	Purpose: A prospective study of preoperative tumor-node-metastasis staging of patients with esophageal cancer (EC) was designed to compare the accuracy of 18-F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with conventional noninvasive modalities.
Case series	Patients and methods: Seventy-four patients with carcinomas of the esophagus (n = 43) or gastroesophageal junction (n = 31) were studied.
Case series	All patients underwent attenuation-corrected FDG-PET imaging, a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Results: FDG-PET demonstrated increased activity in the primary tumor in 70 of 74 patients (sensitivity: 95%).
Case series	False-negative PET images were found in four patients with T1 lesions. Thirty-four patients (46%) had stage IV disease.
Case series	FDG-PET had a higher accuracy for diagnosing stage IV disease compared with the combination of CT and EUS (82% v 64%, respectively; P: =. 004).
Case series	FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 16 (22%) of 74 patients by upstaging 11 (15%) and downstaging five (7%) patients.
Case series	Thirty-nine (53%) of the 74 patients underwent a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy in conjunction with primary curative esophagectomy. In these patients, tumoral involvement was found in 21 local and 35 regional or distant lymph nodes (LN).
Case series	For local LN, the sensitivity of FDG-PET was lower than EUS (33% v 81%, respectively; P: =. 027), but the specificity may have been higher (89% v 67%, respectively; P: = not significant [NS]).
Case series	For the assessment of regional and distant LN involvement, compared with the combined use of CT and EUS, FDG-PET had a higher specificity (90% v 98%, respectively; P: =. 025) and a similar sensitivity (46% v 43%, respectively; P: = NS).
Case series	Conclusion: PET significantly improves the detection of stage IV disease in EC compared with the conventional staging modalities. PET improves diagnostic specificity for LN staging.
Case series	Utility of positron emission tomography for the staging of patients with potentially operable esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the performance of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the staging of cancer in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Materials and methods: The findings of FDG PET and of CT in the chest and upper abdomen of 36 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal carcinoma were compared with pathologic findings obtained either during a curative surgical procedure with tissue sampling (n = 29) or by tissue sampling alone (n = 7).
Case series	Results: Abnormal FDG uptake was identified on PET in the esophageal tumors of all patients.
Case series	In 29 patients who underwent curative esophagectomy, PET and CT accurately revealed the extent of nodal disease in 76% (22/29) and 45% (13/29) of patients, respectively.
Case series	In the seven patients who underwent tissue sampling instead of complete esophagectomy, PET revealed metastatic disease in five patients, all of whom avoided needless surgery. CT failed to reveal metastatic disease in these five patients.
Case series	In addition, PET incidentally revealed an unsuspected primary long carcinoma in one patient. Conclusion: FDG PET is more sensitive than CT for revealing regional and distant metastases in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The use of PET in the staging of esophageal cancer may prove to be cost-effective by decreasing the number of unnecessary surgeries in patients with unresectable tumors.
Case series	Staging of esophageal cancer with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
Case series	Background: Positron emission tomography with the glucose analogue 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been used to detect and stage a variety of malignancies.
Case series	We hypothesized that FDG-positron emission tomography would improve staging of patients with esophageal cancer and thereby facilitate selection of candidates for resection.
Case series	Methods: Fifty-eight patients (42 men and 16 women) with biopsy-proven esophageal cancer were evaluated with both FDG-positron emission tomography and computed tomography.
Case series	Results: In all but 2 patients, increased FDG uptake was identified at the site of the primary tumor. Six patients were not operative candidates. Seventeen patients were not candidates for resection because of metastatic disease.
Case series	Positron emission tomography identified the metastatic disease in all 17 (12 of whom underwent confirmatory biopsy), whereas computed tomography was positive for metastases in only 5.
Case series	The remaining 35 patients underwent surgical exploration, were judged to have resectable disease and had esophagectomy. Pathologic examination of resected specimens identified lymph node metastases in 21 patients.
Case series	These nodes were detected by positron emission tomography in 11 patients and by computed tomography in 6.
Case series	Conclusions: Positron emission tomography improved staging and facilitated selection of patients for operation by detecting distant disease not identified by computed tomography alone.
Case series	Improvement in staging of esophageal cancer with the addition of positron emission tomography
Case series	Background: Pilot studies suggest positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be superior to conventional imaging in staging esophageal cancer, especially in the detection of radiographically occult distant metastases.
Case series	This report summarizes our experience with PET in staging esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: One hundred consecutive PET scans in 91 patients with esophageal cancer referred for surgery were prospectively collected (1995 to 1998) and compared with computerized tomography (CT) and bone scan.
Case series	PET images were acquired after injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and evaluated for abnormal uptake. Minimally invasive surgical staging (MIS) and/or clinical correlation were used to confirm or refute imaging results.
Case series	Results: MIS or clinical correlation confirmed 70 distant metastases in 39 cases. PET detected 51 metastases in 27 of 39 cases (69% sensitivity, 93. 4% specificity, 84% accuracy) compared with CT, which detected 26 metastases in 18 of 39 cases (46.
Case series	1% sensitivity, 73. 8% specificity, 63% accuracy) (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: PET was more accurate than CT in detecting distant metastases, but was only 69% sensitive compared with minimally invasive staging.
Case series	Evaluation of distant metastases in esophageal cancer: 100 consecutive positron emission tomography scans
Case series	Objectives: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z0060 is a prospective multi-institutional trial with a primary objective to evaluate whether positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) detects evidence of metastastic disease that precludes esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer who are surgical candidates after routine staging.
Case series	Methods: Patients with resectable, biopsy-proven carcinoma were enrolled after computed tomography of chest and abdomen demonstrated no evidence of metastasis. FDG-PET was performed according to specified standards.
Case series	FDG-PET findings suggesting metastases required confirmation and patients without metastases on PET were expected to proceed to surgery. Results: A total of 262 patients were registered.
Case series	Of these, 199 were deemed eligible and of these, 189 patients were evaluable. Seventy-three patients were ineligible or unevaluable.
Case series	Reasons for ineligibility included nonresectable disease by routine staging (39), missing or outdated staging procedures (12), PET technical protocol violations (10), no cancer (4), pre-PET induction therapy (3), claustrophobia (1), and other causes (4).
Case series	There were 145 (78%) patients who went on to have surgery, 42 (22%) who did not, and 2 patients for whom the surgical status was not determined.
Case series	The reasons for no resection included the following: M1 disease found by PET and confirmed (9), M1 disease found by PET and not confirmed (2), M1 disease at exploration not found by PET (7), decline or death before surgery (10), patient refusal of surgery (7), unresectable local tumor at exploration (5), and extensive N1 disease precluding operation (2).
Case series	Eight (4. 2%) patients undergoing resection had a recurrence in the first 6 months.
Case series	Conclusions: Although 22% of eligible patients did not undergo esophagectomy, FDG-PET after standard clinical staging for esophageal carcinoma identified confirmed M1b disease in at least 4. 8% (95% confidence interval: 2. 2%-8.
Case series	9%) of patients before resection. Unconfirmed PET evidence of M1 disease and regional adenopathy (N1 disease) led to definitive nonsurgical or induction therapy in additional patients.
Case series	The utility of positron emission tomography in staging of potentially operable carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus: results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0060 trial
Case series	Background: Exact preoperative staging of esophageal cancer is essential for accurate prognosis and selection of appropriate treatment modalities.
Case series	Methods: Forty-two patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or the esophagogastric junction suitable for radical esophageal resection were staged with positron emission tomography (PET), spiral computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).
Case series	Results: Diagnostic sensitivity for the primary tumor was 83% for PET and 67% for CT; for local peritumoral lymph node metastasis, it was 37% for PET and 89% for EUS; and for distant metastasis, it was 47% for PET and 33% for CT.
Case series	Diagnostic specificity for local lymph node metastasis was 100% with PET and 54% with EUS, and for distant metastasis, it was 89% for PET and 96% for CT.
Case series	Accuracy for locoregional lymph node metastasis was 63% for PET, 66% for CT, and 75% for EUS, and for distant metastasis, it was 74% with PET and 74% with CT. Of the 10 patients who were considered inoperable during surgery, PET identified 7 and CT 4.
Case series	The false-negative diagnoses of stage IV disease in PET were peritoneal carcinomatosis in two patients, abdominal para-aortic cancer growth in one, metastatic lymph nodes by the celiac artery in four, and metastases in the pancreas in one.
Case series	PET showed false-positive lymph nodes at the jugulum in three patients.
Case series	Conclusions: The diagnostic value of PET in the staging of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction is limited because of low accuracy in staging of paratumoral and distant lymph nodes.
Case series	PET does, however, seem to detect organ metastases better than CT.
Case series	Prospective analysis of accuracy of positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and endoscopic ultrasonography in staging of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction
Case series	Distant metastases or local invasion are frequently found during the explorative phase of surgery for esophageal cancer.
Case series	This study was performed to determine the rate of patients with incurable disease encountered during exploration and to examine the impact of preoperative staging, including positron emission tomography (PET), on the number of unnecessary explorations.
Case series	The records of 203 patients with esophageal cancer who were eligible for curative resection were retrospectively reviewed. The surgical reports were analyzed to obtain the reasons for abandoning resection.
Case series	Furthermore, the different staging modalities according to the related time interval were reviewed for each patient to analyze the influence of them on the number of explorations.
Case series	After exploratory surgery, resection was abandoned in 78 of the 203 patients (38%) because of distant metastases (n=59; 29%), metastatic spread and local irresectability (n=5; 2%), and local irresectability (n=14; 7%).
Case series	In a logistic regression model with all preoperative staging modalities and the year of examination as independent variables, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET) was the only modality that predicts intended curative resection in these patients (P<0.
Case series	001). In patients with esophageal cancer who are suitable for potentially curative surgery, resection was abandoned mainly because of distant metastases encountered during exploration.
Case series	The addition of FDG-PET may have reduced the rate of unnecessary surgery in this group of patients.
Case series	Positron emission tomography with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose in a combined staging strategy of esophageal cancer prevents unnecessary surgical explorations
Case series	Objective: To assess the value of positron emission tomography (PET) compared with computed tomography (CT) in the initial staging of esophageal cancer. Design: Case series. Setting: Tertiary care veterans hospital.
Case series	Patients: Patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancers from January 1996 through May 2001 who underwent both CT and PET scanning within 4 weeks were included in the study (n = 24).
Case series	Only patients who underwent pathological or radiographic follow-up were included.
Case series	Main outcome measures: The sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of CT and PET were determined based on a criterion standard of pathological staging in 16 patients (67%) and follow-up imaging in 8 patients (33%).
Case series	Results: For staging regional lymph node involvement, CT and PET scans showed no statistically significant difference in sensitivity (57% and 71%, respectively) and specificity (71% and 86%, respectively).
Case series	For detection of metastatic disease, CT and PET showed no significant difference in sensitivity (83% and 67%, respectively) and specificity (75% and 92%, respectively).
Case series	There was no significant difference in clinical decision making when the results of both tests were discordant. Conclusions: There was no significant difference between the 2 imaging modalities in the initial staging of esophageal cancer.
Case series	The CT scan was a sensitive indicator of distant metastases, whereas PET was more specific. It is unclear what additional role PET scanning should have in the initial screening of patients.
Case series	Positron emission tomography in the initial staging of esophageal cancer
review	CT is readily available to all patients. It is relatively inexpensive and fees are usually reimbursed. It provides exquisite anatomic detail of the chest and abdomen in patients with esophageal cancer.
review	The only reliable use of CT in the determination of T is the exclusion of T4 tumors, which is suggested by the preservation of fat planes.
review	Enlarged lymph nodes are suspicious for metastatic disease but require further study or tissue sampling if nodal metastases will determine treatment.
review	Its major use is in the detection of distant metastatic disease; however, 30% to 60% of distant metastases may be radiographically occult. There is a significant learning curve for EUS staging of esophageal cancer.
review	It is suggested that this study be performed at institutions where there is a dedicated, experienced endoscopic ultrasonographer with adequate instrumentation that allows specialty imaging and EUS-FNA.
review	EUS is the best means of clinically determining T. The addition of EUS-FNA to routine EUS evaluation of lymph nodes allows an accuracy similar to the EUS determination of T.
review	EUS has no purpose in assessment of non-nodal distant metastatic disease; however, the serendipitous finding of distant metastases in adjacent structures visualized during the evaluation of the primary tumor and lymph nodes has, on occasion, detected M1b disease.
review	FDG-PET represents an advance over CT scanning in the screening for distant metastases. The major problems with FDG-PET staging of esophageal cancer is failure to detect metastatic deposits less than 1 cm in diameter and lack of anatomic definition.
review	It is unable to determine T and has been inaccurate in the detection of lymph node metastases. Because this test is not readily available, is expensive, and is not routinely reimbursed, its use in staging esophageal cancer continues to be limited.
review	Today, CT and EUS are the mainstays in the clinical staging of esophageal carcinoma. When possible, FDG-PET should be added to CT to improve the evaluation of non-nodal M1b disease.
review	Results of these studies should determine the necessity for invasive staging techniques and direct their use.
review	Clinical staging of esophageal carcinoma. CT, EUS, and PET
Case series	Purpose: To assess the accuracy of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) when staging different malignant diseases.
Case series	Patients and methods: This was a retrospective, blinded, investigator-initiated study of 260 patients with various oncological diseases who underwent fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose PET/CT for tumor staging.
Case series	CT images alone, PET images alone, PET + CT data viewed side by side, and fused PET/CT images were evaluated separately according to the tumor-node-metastasis system.
Case series	One hundred forty patients with tumors not staged according to the tumor-node-metastasis system or a lack of reference standard were excluded from data analysis; 260 patients were included.
Case series	Diagnostic accuracies were determined for each of the four image sets. Histopathology and a clinical follow-up of 311 (+/- 125) days served as standards of reference.
Case series	Results: PET/CT proved significantly more accurate in assessing tumor-node-metastasis system stage compared with CT alone, PET alone, and side-by-side PET + CT (P <. 0001).
Case series	Of 260 patients, 218 (84%; 95% CI, 79% to 88%) were correctly staged with PET/CT, 197 (76%; 95% CI, 70% to 81%) with side-by-side PET + CT, 163 (63%; 95% CI, 57% to 69%) with CT alone, and 166 (64%; 95% CI, 58% to 70%) with PET alone.
Case series	Combined PET/CT had an impact on the treatment plan in 16, 39, and 43 patients when compared with PET + CT, CT alone, and PET alone, respectively.
Case series	Conclusion: Tumor staging with PET/CT is significantly more accurate than CT alone, PET alone, and side-by-side PET + CT. This diagnostic advantage translates into treatment plan changes in a substantial number of patients.
Case series	Accuracy of whole-body dual-modality fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) for tumor staging in solid tumors: comparison with CT and PET
Case series	Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the value of combined PET/CT compared with PET reviewed side-by-side with CT, in patients with oesophageal cancer, before and after surgery.
Case series	Methods: Forty-one FDG PET/CT studies were performed in 32 patients with oesophageal cancer, before surgery (n = 18) or during follow-up after resection of the primary tumour (n = 23).
Case series	One hundred and fifteen sites suspicious for malignancy were evaluated. PET/CT was prospectively compared with PET reviewed side-by-side with CT, for detection, accurate localisation and characterisation of malignant sites.
Case series	PET/CT performance in different anatomical regions was compared before and after surgery. The impact of fused data on patient management was retrospectively assessed.
Case series	Results: PET/CT had an incremental value over PET for interpretation of 25 of 115 sites (22%), changing the initial characterisation of ten sites to either malignant (n = 1) or benign (n = 9), and defining the precise anatomical location of 15 sites.
Case series	PET/CT provided better specificity and accuracy than PET for detecting sites of oesophageal cancer (81% and 90% vs 59% and 83% respectively, p < 0. 01).
Case series	Fusion was of special value for interpretation of cervical and abdomino-pelvic sites, for disease assessment in loco-regional lymph nodes before surgery and in regions of postoperative anatomical distortion.
Case series	PET/CT had an impact on the further management of four patients (10%), by detecting nodal metastases that warranted disease upstaging (n = 2) and by excluding disease in sites of benign uptake after surgery (n = 2).
Case series	Conclusion: PET/CT improves the accuracy of FDG imaging in oesophageal cancer and provides data of diagnostic and therapeutic significance for further patient management.
Case series	The additional value of PET/CT over PET in FDG imaging of oesophageal cancer
Case series	Objectives: The use of IV contrast media in PET/CT can result in an overestimation of PET attenuation factors that potentially can affect interpretation.
Case series	The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of IV contrast media in PET/CT and assess its impact on patients with intrathoracic malignancies.
Case series	Materials and methods: Nine patients had CTs performed with and without IV contrast media followed by (18)F-FDG PET. PET images were reconstructed using contrast-enhanced and unenhanced CT.
Case series	To quantify the effect of contrast media on standardized uptake values (SUV), similar regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the subclavian vein, heart, liver, spleen, and site of malignancy on both CT and corresponding reconstructed PET images, and the mean and maximum values were compared.
Case series	In addition, two physicians blinded to the imaging parameters that were used evaluated the reconstructed PET images to assess whether IV contrast media had an effect on clinical interpretation.
Case series	Results: For all patient studies, the subclavian vein region on the ipsilateral side of contrast media administration had the highest increase in CT numbers with a corresponding average SUV(max) increase of 27. 1%.
Case series	Similarly, ROIs of the heart and at the site of malignancy showed an increase in the maximum attenuation value with a corresponding average SUV(max) increase of 16. 7% and 8. 4%, respectively.
Case series	Other locations had relatively small attenuation value differences with a correspondingly negligible SUV variation.
Case series	Conclusion: Although there is a significant increase in SUV in regions of high-contrast concentration when contrast-enhanced CT is used for attenuation correction, this increase is clinically insignificant.
Case series	Accordingly, in PET/CT, IV contrast-enhanced CT can be used in combination with the PET to evaluate patients with cancer.
Case series	Quantifying the effect of IV contrast media on integrated PET/CT: clinical evaluation
meta analysis	Background and purpose: Esophageal cancer is the third most common gastrointestinal malignancy with a poor long-term survival and high mortality. Surgical resection provides the only chance of cure.
meta analysis	The tumor-node metastasis stage classification system is a strong prognostic parameter predicting the prognosis.
meta analysis	We performed the present meta-analysis to comprehensively review the evidence for use of standardized uptake value (SUV) measured on tumor to predict prognosis of esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: We searched for articles published in English or Chinese; limited to esophageal cancer; F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (F-FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) performed on a dedicated device; dealt with the impact of SUV on survival.
meta analysis	We extracted an estimate of the log hazard ratios (HR) and their variances and performed meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Results: Without the study dealt by the pretreatment SUV measured on metastasis sites, there were seven studies dealt by the prognostic value of SUV measured on FDG-PET for overall survival. The combined HR was 1.
meta analysis	86, meaning that high SUV indicated worse survival prognosis; and there were three studies dealt with the prognostic value of SUV measured on FDG-PET for disease-free survival. The combined HR was 2.
meta analysis	52, indicating that high SUV was associated with more significantly higher risk for recurrence than low SUV.
meta analysis	Conclusion: SUV measured in patients with esophageal cancer, reflecting the metabolic activity of tumor and malignancy, could serve as a prognostic factor.
meta analysis	Considering that the FDG-PET can add important information of metabolism in detection and staging to conventional imaging modality, we anticipate that SUV could be used in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	Prognostic significance of SUV on PET/CT in patients with esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Case series	Introduction: We have previously shown that in early clinical stage esophageal adenocarcinoma, a positron emission tomography standardized uptake values (PET SUVmax) of <4. 5 is associated with earlier pathologic stage and predicts better survival.
Case series	In this study, we analyze the impact of the pretreatment PET SUVmax in patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma who undergo preoperative chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis, selecting patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus who had a pretreatment PET scan and who received chemoradiotherapy before esophagectomy.
Case series	Data recorded included demographics, PET SUVmax, treatment details, pathologic details, and survival data.
Case series	Comparison of categorical variables was done by chi analysis, continuous variables by t test, survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons of survival using the log-rank test.
Case series	Results: Between January 1996 and September 2007, 189 patients were appropriate for this analysis. The initial PET SUVmax was <4. 5 in 28 patients and >or=4. 5 in 161 patients.
Case series	The two groups were similar with regards to demographics and treatment details.
Case series	Patients in the low SUV group were less likely to show evidence of treatment response after chemoradiotherapy, including a higher likelihood of residual nodal disease and a lower likelihood of a pathologic complete response and estimated treatment response.
Case series	However, both groups had similar survival.
Case series	Conclusions: Although the initial PET SUVmax does not predict survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, patients with a high initial SUVmax respond better to preoperative therapy.
Case series	These results can be used to better select esophageal cancer patients for combined modality treatment.
Case series	Predictive value of initial PET-SUVmax in patients with locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma
meta analysis	Purpose: To systematically review the accuracy of fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Materials and methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. Methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed.
meta analysis	Sensitivities and specificities of (18)F FDG PET in individual studies were calculated and underwent meta-analysis with a random effects model.
meta analysis	A summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) was constructed with the Moses-Shapiro-Littenberg method. A chi(2) test was performed to test for heterogeneity (defined as P <. 10).
meta analysis	Potential sources for heterogeneity were explored by assessing whether certain covariates significantly (P <. 05) influenced the relative diagnostic odds ratio.
meta analysis	Results: Twenty reports, comprising a total of 849 patients with esophageal cancer, were included. Overall, the studies were of moderate methodologic quality.
meta analysis	Sensitivity and specificity of (18)F FDG PET ranged from 33% to 100% and from 30% to 100%, respectively, with pooled estimates of 67% (95% confidence interval: 62%, 72%) and 68% (95% confidence interval: 64%, 73%), respectively.
meta analysis	The area under the sROC curve was 0. 7815. There was significant heterogeneity in both the sensitivity and specificity of the included studies (P <. 0001). Spearman rho between the logit of sensitivity and the logit of 1-specificity was 0. 086 (P =.
meta analysis	719), which suggested that there was no threshold effect. Studies performed outside of the United States and studies of higher methodologic quality yielded significantly higher overall accuracy.
meta analysis	Conclusion: On the basis of current evidence, (18)F FDG PET should not yet be used in routine clinical practice to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions in patients with esophageal cancer. Supplemental material: http://radiology. rsna.

meta analysis	Prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal cancer with use of 18F FDG PET: a systematic review
Case series	Purpose: We examined survival of patients who underwent esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer with foci that were suspicious for metastatic disease on initial imaging but whose disease did not progress after induction chemoradiation treatment (CRT).
Case series	Methods: The impact of pre- and posttherapy staging characteristics on survival of patients who underwent esophagectomy after CRT between 2003 and 2009 was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.
Case series	Survival of patients with and without possible metastatic disease on initial imaging was compared with the log-rank test.
Case series	Results: During the study period, 71 (32%) of 220 patients who underwent CRT followed by esophagectomy had possible distant metastatic disease on initial imaging. Patients with initial suspicion of metastases had a 5-year survival of 24. 8%.
Case series	Overall survival of patients with and without possible metastatic disease on initial imaging was not significantly different (p = 0. 4), but pretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) suggesting a liver lesion (hazard ratio [HR] 3. 2, p = 0.
Case series	003) predicted worse survival. Additional predictors of worse survival were clinical T4 status (HR 3. 1, p = 0. 001), post-CRT pathologic nodal status (HR 1. 6, p = 0. 04), and pathologically confirmed metastatic disease at or before resection (HR 3.
Case series	1, p = 0. 01). None of 10 patients with pathologic metastatic disease at resection lived longer than 2. 5 years.
Case series	Conclusions: Patients with possible liver metastases on pretreatment PET and patients with confirmed metastatic disease at the time of surgery do not benefit from resection.
Case series	However, patients with pretreatment imaging that shows possible metastatic disease in sites other than the liver still have reasonable long-term survival after resection.
Case series	Impact of pretreatment imaging on survival of esophagectomy after induction therapy for esophageal cancer: who should be given the benefit of the doubt?: esophagectomy outcomes of patients with suspicious metastatic lesions
Case series	Objective: To compare the diagnostic performance of MR and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), multidetector CT, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and 18F-FDG (fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT) in the pre-operative locoregional staging of oesophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: 18 patients with oesophageal or Siewert I tumour (9 directly treated with surgery and 9 addressed to chemo-/radiotherapy before) underwent 1.
Case series	5-T MR and DWI, 64-channel multidetector CT, EUS and PET-CT before (n = 18) and also after neoadjuvant treatment (n = 9). All images were analysed and staged blindly by dedicated operators (seventh TNM edition).
Case series	Two radiologists calculated independently the apparent diffusion coefficient from the first scan. Results were compared with histopathological findings.
Case series	After the population had been divided according to local invasion (T1-T2 vs T3-T4) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive- and negative-predictive values were calculated and compared.
Case series	Quantitative measurements from DWI and PET-CT were also analysed. Results: For T staging, EUS showed the best sensitivity (100%), whereas MR showed the highest specificity (92%) and accuracy (83%).
Case series	For N staging, MR and EUS showed the highest sensitivity (100%), but none of the techniques showed adequate results for specificity.
Case series	Overall, MR showed the highest accuracy (66%) for N stage, although this was not significantly different to the other modalities. The apparent diffusion coefficient was different between surgery-only and chemo-/radiotherapy groups (1. 90 vs 1.
Case series	30 × 10-3 mm2 s-1, respectively; p = 0. 005)-optimal cut off for local invasion: 1. 33 × 10-3 mm2 s-1 (p = 0. 05). Difference in standardized uptake value was also very close to conventional levels of statistical significance (8. 81 vs 13.
Case series	97 g cm-3, respectively; p = 0. 05)-optimal cut off: 7. 97 g cm-3 (p = 0. 44). Conclusion: In this pilot study, we have shown that MR with DWI could enrich the current pre-operative work-up for oesophageal cancer and could be used for T and N staging.
Case series	However, larger studies will need to be carried out before introducing this technique in the standard diagnostic pathway, in order to understand if MR with DWI could change its management and replace more costly or invasive tests such as PET-CT or EUS.
Case series	Advances in knowledge: This pilot study represents the first effort where the four techniques have been prospectively compared together for oesophageal cancer staging.
Case series	The combination of MR and DWI could provide important, additional information for staging and initial treatment decision-making.
Case series	Prospective comparison of MR with diffusion-weighted imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, MDCT and positron emission tomography-CT in the pre-operative staging of oesophageal cancer: results from a pilot study
Case series	Background: The objective of the study was to determine the utility of integrated computed tomography / positron emission tomography (CT-PET) imaging for detecting interval distant metastases and assessing therapeutic response in patients with locally advanced, potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Methods: A retrospective study was performed of 88 patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma who received neoadjuvant therapy before planned surgical resection.
Case series	CT-PET before and after completion of neoadjuvant was used for evaluating therapeutic response; response criteria were based on qualitative and semiquantitative analyses.
Case series	Results: Neoadjuvant therapy comprised chemoradiotherapy in 85 patients, with prior induction chemotherapy in 39 patients. Fifty-five patients proceeded to esophagectomy.
Case series	Repeat CT-PET was performed after induction chemotherapy (n = 23) and after completing chemoradiotherapy (n = 85). CT-PET identified the interval appearance of metastatic disease in 7 (8%) patients.
Case series	For assessment of locoregional therapeutic response, CT-PET was unable to predict pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in the primary tumor or locoregional lymph nodes.
Case series	CT-PET had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 57%, 46%, 39%, and 64%, respectively, for detection of residual macroscopic malignancy within the primary tumor; and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 0%, 90%, 0%, and 69% for detection of residual malignancy within resected lymph nodes.
Case series	Conclusions: CT-PET performed after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma is important for detecting interval metastases that preclude surgical resection, but is of limited utility for assessing locoregional therapeutic response.
Case series	Detection of interval distant metastases: clinical utility of integrated CT-PET imaging in patients with esophageal carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy
Case series	Background: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is an accurate modality for locoregional staging of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Given an increasing prevalence of distal esophageal adenocarcinoma, some centers employ laparoscopic staging (LS) in addition to noninvasive staging methods. We sought to compare EUS and LS for nodal staging in patients with esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: All newly diagnosed, EUS-staged esophageal cancer cases during an 18-month period were reviewed. Patients who underwent both EUS and LS comprised the study cohort; EUS records, operative notes, and pathology reports were reviewed.
Case series	Inability to pass the radial echoendoscope through the malignant stricture despite dilation was considered an incomplete EUS examination.
Case series	Results: Forty-seven patients were identified who underwent both modalities for staging; of these, 70% had complete EUS evaluation. For nodal staging, EUS-fine-needle aspiration was 90% accurate as compared with LS.
Case series	Overall, staging accuracy of EUS compared with LS was 72%. Accuracy was 76% for patients with complete EUS staging compared with 64% for patients with incomplete EUS examinations.
Case series	Staging differences were mostly reflected in distant metastases detected at LS (17%). Conclusions: Endoscopic ultrasonography is nearly as accurate as LS in nodal staging for esophageal cancer.
Case series	The value of LS is accurate abdominal nodal staging and detection of occult distant metastases. Laparoscopic staging should, therefore, be incorporated into staging algorithms for neoadjuvant protocols.
Case series	In the absence of preoperative therapy, LS should be performed at the time of planned esophagectomy. In those without occult metastases, curative resection may be attempted.
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasound compared with laparoscopy for staging esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Conventional preoperative staging for esophageal carcinoma could be inaccurate. Laparoscopy has been applied for the staging of various upper gastrointestinal malignancies.
Case series	It can identify peritoneal and liver deposits not shown by imaging, and could reduce the number of nontherapeutic laparotomies.
Case series	This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic staging for the management of squamous cell carcinoma involving the mid and distal esophagus.
Case series	Methods: A retrospective review was performed for all patients with esophageal cancer evaluated for surgical resection from January 1998 to January 2004.
Case series	Laparoscopy was performed for all the patients with mid and distal esophageal cancer immediately before open gastric mobilization. The efficacy of laparoscopy for the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus was evaluated.
Case series	Results: Among the 63 patients with potentially resectable disease shown on conventional imaging, 54 (84%) underwent esophagectomy with curative intent after laparoscopic staging.
Case series	Seven patients (11%) underwent laparoscopy alone because of abdominal metastases (n = 5) or other medical conditions (n = 2) that precluded esophagectomy.
Case series	Two patients (3%) had exploratory right thoracotomy without esophagectomy despite normal laparoscopic findings.
Case series	The sensitivity and specificity of laparoscopic staging were 100% in this series of patients (100% sensitivity and specificity means no false-positives or -negatives).
Case series	Conclusion: Laparoscopic staging is valuable for the management of patients with mid and distal squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Patients with metastatic disease and those with prohibitive surgical risk can thus avoid unnecessary laparotomy and be offered other treatment methods.
Case series	Immediate preoperative laparoscopic staging for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	Aims: Accurate staging of gastric, oesophageal and oesophagogastric cancer is essential to avoid unnecessary laparotomies in patients where only palliation is appropriate.
Case series	This requires a multimodal approach utilizing endoscopy, computed tomography and laparoscopy. Previous authors have found that the presence of free peritoneal tumour cells (FPTCs) detected at laparoscopy or laparotomy confers a poorer prognosis.
Case series	However, various methods of peritoneal lavage are described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of our technique of peritoneal lavage.
Case series	Materials and methods: 88 staging laparoscopies with peritoneal lavage were carried out between March 1997 and February 1999 on patients eligible for attempted curative resection of a gastric, oesophageal or oesophagogastric cancer.
Case series	During laparoscopy the pelvis was irrigated with 200 ml of normal saline, with 100 ml aspirated and examined cytologically. Patients were followed-up until September, 1999.
Case series	Results: 11 patients had FPTC-positive cytology with a median survival following laparoscopy of 122 days (95% CI 82-161) with only a single patient surviving more than one year. In the FPTC-negative group, median survival was 378 days (95% CI 256,-).
Case series	Log-rank Chi(2)=16. 7, P<0. 001. Conclusions: The presence of FPTCs detected by our technique is a contraindication to attempted curative resection - palliation only (medical or surgical) is appropriate.
Case series	Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage in staging gastric and oesophageal cancer
Case series	Background: The staging of esophageal cancer is imprecise. Thoracoscopic/laparoscopic (TS/LS) staging has been proposed as a more accurate lymph node (LN) staging method.
Case series	We report the experience of an Intergroup NCI trial (CALGB 9380) evaluating the feasibility and accuracy of this staging modality. Patients and methods: From February 1995 to September 1999, 134 patients were entered in the study.
Case series	This study represents the analysis of final data on 113 patients. TS/LS was considered feasible if TS and 1 LN sampled at least 3 LN by LS; a confirmed positive node was found; or T4 or M1 disease was documented.
Case series	If this was accomplished in more than 70% of patients, TS/LS was believed to be feasible.
Case series	Results: The LN stations most frequently sampled in the thorax (134 patients) were levels 2 (33%), 3 (38%), 4 (40%), 7 (76%), 8 (69%), 9 (55%), and 10 (43%) and in the abdomen levels 17 (70%) and 20 (55%).
Case series	The frequency of positive LN by level were as follows: 2 (10%), 3 (8%), 4 (10%), 7 (10%), 8 (25%), 9 (10%), 10 (10%), 17 (34%), and 20 (27%).
Case series	Noninvasive tests (computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, esophageal ultrasound scan) each incorrectly identified TN staging as noted by missed positive or false-negative LN or metastatic disease found at TS/LS staging in 50%, 40%, and 30% of patients, respectively.
Case series	Median operating time was 210 minutes (range, 40 to 865 minutes). Median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1 to 35 days). There were no deaths or major complications. Seventy-three percent of patients met the definition for feasibility.
Case series	In 30 patients TS was not feasible. Positive LN disease was found in 43 patients; 32 were deemed N0. Ten patients had T4/M1 disease.
Case series	Of the 32 potentially resectable N0 patients, 14 patients had preoperative induction therapy; 13 patients went directly to operation with N0 confirmed in 9 patients, NX in 1 and N1 in 3.
Case series	Three patients were unresectable, 1 patient died, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Conclusions: In summary, the feasibility of TS/LS was confirmed. It doubled the number of positive LNs identified by conventional, noninvasive staging.
Case series	The overall accuracy remains to be defined by analysis of the LN negative group in follow-up. Although the positive predictive value was high, further study is warranted to confirm the role of TS/LS in the staging algorithm of esophageal cancer.
Case series	CALGB 9380: a prospective trial of the feasibility of thoracoscopy/laparoscopy in staging esophageal cancer
Case series	Precise clinical staging of esophageal cancer before treatment is important. Thoracoscopic/laparoscopic (Ts/Ls) staging has been proposed as a promising staging method.
Case series	This study was conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of Ts/Ls staging over conventional noninvasive clinical staging in patients with esophageal cancer.
Case series	From 1991 to 1999, 111 patients with esophageal cancer underwent Ts/Ls staging by the University of Maryland Medical System.
Case series	Pretreatment staging workup included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and esophageal ultrasonography, followed by Ts/Ls surgical staging.
Case series	Thoracoscopy was successfully performed in 102 patients and was aborted in 4 patients because of pleural adhesions. Laparoscopy was successfully done in 76 patients and was aborted in 1 patient because of peritoneal adhesion.
Case series	Sixty-seven patients had both Ts and Ls staging, whereas 35 patients and 9 patients, respectively, had only Ts or Ls staging.
Case series	Thirteen of 19 patients with clinical T4 disease were downstaged to T3 disease, and 8 patients with clinical T3 disease were upstaged to T4 by Ts/Ls staging. No clinical T1-2 disease was found to be associated with local invasion (T4) by Ts/Ls.
Case series	Forty-eight and 19 patients had mediastinal and celiac lymph node metastases clinically diagnosed, respectively. Nine (18. 8%) and 12 (63. 2%) of them were proved by Ts and Ls, respectively.
Case series	An additional 5 and 16 patients were found to have unexpected mediastinal and celiac lymph node metastases, respectively, by Ts/Ls.
Case series	Biopsy specimens of pleura, lung, or liver were obtained by Ts/Ls procedures in 17 patients because of suspicious findings of routine imaging studies or unexpected findings during the staging operation.
Case series	Five patients were found to have distant metastasis, and the presence of metastases in others was excluded.
Case series	The correlation between Ts/Ls staging and conventional noninvasive clinical staging in the diagnosis of T4 disease, mediastinal lymph node metastasis, celiac lymph node metastasis, and M1 disease was 18. 8%, 14. 5%, 25. 5%, and 20. 0%, respectively.
Case series	Ts/Ls provides more accurate information for evaluating local invasion, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis.
Case series	The poor correlation of staging diagnosis between Ts/Ls and conventional noninvasive clinical examinations suggests that the accuracy of current noninvasive clinical staging is questionable and needs to be improved.
Case series	Thoracoscopy/laparoscopy in the staging of esophageal cancer: Maryland experience
Case series	Objective: Endoscopic ultrasonography is frequently used to locally stage esophageal cancer, but few studies exist to validate its accuracy for lymph node metastases.
Case series	Our objective was to compare endoscopic ultrasonography with video-assisted thoracoscopic and laparoscopic staging in evaluating lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: Twenty-six patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer were identified by conventional imaging. Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed followed by laparoscopic and thoracoscopic staging, and locoregional staging was compared.
Case series	Results: In eight patients endoscopic ultrasonography indicated N0 disease, but laparoscopy and thoracoscopy documented N1 disease in six.
Case series	In five of 26 (19%) obstruction prevented endoscopic ultrasonography; three had N1 by laparoscopy and thoracoscopy.
Case series	Thirteen patients had N1 disease according to endoscopic ultrasonography, and 12 of 13 (92%) had N1 disease by laparoscopy and thoracoscopy.
Case series	The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasonography for nodal evaluation were 65% and 66%, respectively. Sensitivity decreased to 44% for lymph node metastases less than 1 cm.
Case series	No instances of T4 disease were found by surgical staging when endoscopic ultrasonography indicated T3 disease. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed no distant metastases in any patient, but in four of 26 (15%) laparoscopy identified liver metastases.
Case series	Conclusions: The accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer was 65% and only 44% for lymph node metastases less than 1 cm diameter.
Case series	Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy improved the accuracy of staging lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer and had the advantage of evaluating the thoracic and abdominal cavities for metastases.
Case series	Minimally invasive surgical staging is superior to endoscopic ultrasound in detecting lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: TNM staging of gastroesophageal cancer is improved by the use of laparoscopy for the detection of occult metastases and endoscopic ultrasonography for T and possibly N staging.
Case series	Laparoscopic ultrasonography may combine the strengths of both of these techniques. The purpose of this study was to compare TNM staging by means of laparoscopic ultrasonography (Lap US), laparoscopy, and conventional computed tomography (CT).
Case series	Methods: TNM stage was determined by using Lap US, laparoscopy, and CT scanning in 26 surgical candidates with gastric or esophageal cancer in a blinded fashion. CT scans were also reviewed separately by an expert radiologist.
Case series	Validation of findings was by means of final pathologic examination.
Case series	Results: Resectability for potential cure was determined by means of Lap US with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 91% versus 100% and 73% for laparoscopy and 75% and 60% for CT, respectively.
Case series	Overall TNM staging was 82% accurate for Lap US versus 67% for laparoscopy and 47% for CT (chi-squared, 8. 64, p < 0. 005, and 10. 4, p < 0. 005, respectively).
Case series	Accuracies for Lap US versus laparoscopy versus CT for N stage were 92% versus 84% versus 70%, respectively, for T stage were 92% versus 42% versus 60%, respectively, and for M stage were 89% versus 44% versus 62%, respectively.
Case series	Conclusions: T and N staging by Lap US were comparable to published results for endoscopic ultrasonography, and overall TNM staging was better.
Case series	Lap US may provide the optimal preoperative staging for gastric cancer and has the potential to complement endoscopic ultrasonography in staging esophageal cancer.
Case series	Laparoscopic ultrasonography for staging gastroesophageal cancer
Case series	Introduction and objective: Oesophago-gastric carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis despite advances in diagnosis and treatment.
Case series	Accurate preoperative staging of gastro-oesophageal carcinoma is, therefore, essential in order to determine patient selection for potentially curative resection.
Case series	The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the role of computerised tomography (CT), laparoscopic ultrasound (LapUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the staging of oesophago-gastric carcinoma.
Case series	Methods and patients: Thirty-six patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the oesophagus or stomach who were considered fit for surgical resection were identified from a prospectively collected database.
Case series	All patients underwent spiral CT, LapUS and EUS as part of their preoperative staging investigations.
Case series	RESULTS from the staging modalities were compared retrospectively with final histopathology where available and to intraoperative findings where the tumour was irresectable.
Case series	Results: Locally advanced tumours (T3/T4) were accurately identified by CT in 15/16 (94%) and by EUS in 14/16 (88%).
Case series	LapUS was unable to detect 11 tumours (of which five were T3/T4) because they were above the diaphragm, but in the locally advanced cases where the tumour could be seen the accuracy was 10/12 (83%).
Case series	EUS was the best modality for assessing early tumours and locoregional nodal involvement with accuracies of 8/13 (62%) and 21/29 (72%), respectively.
Case series	EUS accuracies rose to 64, 92 and 83% for T1/T2, T3/T4 and N staging with the exclusion of those patients (n=6) in whom strictures prevented full assessment.
Case series	LapUS had a specificity of 100%, compared to 90% for CT and was more accurate than CT for assessing distant metastases (accuracy of 26/32 (81%) compared to 23/32 (72%) for CT).
Case series	Conclusions: Although this study is small it has confirmed that CT, EUS and LapUS act in a complimentary manner to provide the most complete preoperative staging for patients with oesophago-gastric cancer.
Case series	A comparison of computerised tomography, laparoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound in the preoperative staging of oesophago-gastric carcinoma
Case series	Introduction: The role of laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) during staging laparoscopy for pancreatic cancers is established but remains debatable in evaluating oesophagogastric cancers.
Case series	Methods: A retrospective consecutive case series consisting of patients undergoing staging laparoscopy in two centres (centre A and B) was carried out over a 5-year period (2000-2005).
Case series	Patients in centre B underwent LUS following laparoscopic assessment using a 7. 5-MHz probe. Staging laparoscopy in both centres was performed using a standardised three-port protocol using a 30 degrees laparoscope.
Case series	All suspicious lesions were sent for histological assessment for confirmation of malignancy. Results: There were 201 patients in centre A (83 gastric, 138 lower oesophageal/junctional cancers) and 119 patients in centre B (51 and 68, respectively).
Case series	There were no differences between the two centres for patient demographics and tumour site. There was no difference between the two centres for the detection of metastatic disease using laparoscopic assessment alone (A 13% versus B 20%, p = 0. 12).
Case series	However, there was a significant difference (13% versus 28%, p = 0. 001) with the additional use of LUS in centre B.
Case series	The findings in the additional 8% (n = 9) were para-aortic lymphadenopathy (n = 5), liver metastasis (n = 3) and local extension (n = 1). Five had gastric and four lower oesophageal/junctional cancers. The negative predictive value was 6.
Case series	4% for centre A and 4. 5% for centre B. Conclusion: The addition of LUS increased the detection rate of metastasis by 8% but there was little impact on the false-negative rate.
Case series	LUS is useful in detecting metastatic lymphadenopathy beyond the limits of curative resection and liver metastasis.
Case series	Evaluation of the role of laparoscopic ultrasonography in the staging of oesophagogastric cancers
Case series	Background: Esophageal carcinoma rarely metastasizes to the brain.
Case series	The objectives of the current study were to assess the frequency of brain metastasis from an esophageal primary tumor, to determine correlates of survival, and to describe treatment modalities and their outcomes.
Case series	Methods: Between June, 1993 and July, 2001, 1588 patients with a primary esophageal carcinoma registered at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center; of those, 27 patients (1. 7%) had a diagnosis of brain metastasis.
Case series	The authors collected demographic and clinical data and performed a statistical analysis. Results: The median age at the time patients were diagnosed with brain metastasis was 62 years.
Case series	Tumor histologies were adenocarcinoma in 22 patients (82%), unclassified carcinoma in 3 patients (11%), and squamous cell carcinoma in 2 patients (7%). Twenty patients (74%) experienced symptoms related to the brain metastasis.
Case series	The metastases were treated with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) alone in 15 patients (56%), and 10 patients (37%) underwent surgical resection, 4 of whom (15%) also received WBRT. Two patients (7%) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery.
Case series	The median survival for the entire cohort after diagnosis of the primary tumor was 12. 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2. 17-22. 5 months), and the median survival after the diagnosis of brain metastasis was 3. 8 months (95% CI, 1. 1-6.
Case series	5 months). The longest median survival observed after the diagnosis of brain metastasis (9. 6 months) occurred in patients with a single brain lesion who underwent resection and received WBRT.
Case series	There was a trend toward worse survival in patients with liver metastases and patients in recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class II-III versus RPA Class I (P = 0. 10 for both; multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis).
Case series	Conclusions: Approximately 2% of patients with esophageal carcinoma had a diagnosis of brain metastasis. Improved outcome was associated with single brain lesions in patients who underwent surgery and received WBRT.
Case series	Known liver metastasis and higher RPA scores were associated with a poorer survival trend.
Case series	Metastasis of esophageal carcinoma to the brain
Case series	Purpose: To assess the value of screening enhanced head CT before esophagectomy for carcinoma, identify increased risk factor(s) for brain metastases, and determine metastasis incidence.
Case series	Methods: Thoracic surgery files of patients undergoing esophagectomies for squamous carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas between January 1984 and March 1993 were reviewed regarding sex, size (length) of neoplasm, and brain metastases.
Case series	Surgical pathology and tumor registry files also were reviewed. Records of patients with brain metastases were reviewed in detail.
Case series	Results: Three hundred thirty-four esophagectomies were performed for 230 adenocarcinomas (202 male, 28 female) and 104 squamous carcinomas (61 male, 43 female).
Case series	In 9 males and 1 female with adenocarcinomas and 1 male and 1 female with squamous carcinomas, brain metastases developed.
Case series	Surgical pathology files identified 293 additional esophageal carcinomas, including 2 males with adenocarcinomas metastatic to brain. Tumor registry files identified I additional male with brain metastasis from an undifferentiated esophageal neoplasm.
Case series	No statistically significant preoperative characteristic of esophageal carcinomas with proneness to brain metastases was found, except large size of primary neoplasm.
Case series	Preoperative screening head CT done on approximately 240 patients who underwent esophagectomies showed no metastases. Conclusions: Brain metastases from carcinomas of the esophagus are relatively uncommon (3. 6% in the esophagectomy cohort).
Case series	They tend to occur in patients with large primary neoplasm, probably especially adenocarcinomas involving the esophagogastric junction, and with findings of local invasion and lymph node metastases by CT and/or microscopically.
Case series	It may be reasonable to obtain head CT as a last preoperative staging procedure in such patients. Routine preoperative head CT for staging is not cost effective.
Case series	Esophageal carcinoma metastatic to the brain: clinical value and cost-effectiveness of routine enhanced head CT before esophagectomy
Case series	Aim: To determine the incidence of brain metastasis in a contemporary group of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Methods: Retrospective analysis of 53 patients with esophageal carcinoma who received radiotherapy as a component of treatment between 1998 and 2007, including patient and tumor characteristics, and subsequent diagnosis of brain metastasis.
Case series	The association between the histological type of esophageal cancer and the incidence of brain metastasis was assessed using Fisher's exact test.
Case series	Results: Forty-four of the fifty-three patients in this study had adenocarcinoma and nine had squamous cell carcinoma, ranging from stage IIA-IVB.
Case series	Primary treatment was surgery with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (trimodality therapy) in 19% of patients; chemoradiotherapy in 42%; and surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy in 7%.
Case series	Twenty-five percent of patients in this study received palliative radiotherapy. The overall incidence of brain metastasis in this cohort was 13%.
Case series	Adenocarcinoma was the primary tumor histology in all of the patients who developed brain metastasis, representing an incidence of 16% in this subgroup. No patients with squamous cell carcinoma received trimodality therapy.
Case series	The association between histology and brain metastasis was not statistically significant.
Case series	Conclusion: The incidence of brain metastasis in this contemporary cohort of patients with esophageal carcinoma is higher than previously reported and was confined to those with adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Incidence of brain metastasis in patients with esophageal carcinoma
randomized controlled trial	Objectives: A dramatic rise in incidence, an aging population, and expensive palliative treatments have led to an escalating burden on clinicians managing inoperable esophageal cancer with only limited evidence of effectiveness.
randomized controlled trial	This study compares the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs) with other palliative therapies to aid clinicians in making an evidence-based treatment choice.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial with 215 patients followed until death or study closure.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome measures were dysphagia, quality of life (QL) 6 weeks following treatment, and total cost of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included treatment-associated morbidity, mortality, survival, and cost-effectiveness.
randomized controlled trial	An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out. Results: There was a significant difference in mean dysphagia grade between treatment arms 6 weeks following treatment (P=0.
randomized controlled trial	046), with worse swallowing reported by rigid stent-treated patients (mean dysphagia score difference=-0. 49; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0. 10 to -0. 89, P=0. 014).
randomized controlled trial	Global QL scores were lower at both 1 and 6 weeks following treatment for patients treated by SEMSs (mean difference QL index week 1=-0. 66; 95% CI: -0. 02 to -1. 30, P=0. 04; mean difference QL index week 6=-1. 01; 95% CI -0. 30 to -1. 72, P=0. 006).
randomized controlled trial	These findings were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores in the SEMS patient group (mean difference of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C-30 pain symptom score at week 1=11. 13; 95% CI: 2. 89-19. 4; P=0.
randomized controlled trial	01). Although mean EQ-5D QL values differed between the treatments (P<0. 001), this difference dissipated following generation of quality-adjusted life year values.
randomized controlled trial	Total costs varied between treatment arms but these findings canceled out when SEMSs were compared with non-SEMS therapies (95% CI -845. 15-1,332. 62). These results were robust to sensitivity analysis.
randomized controlled trial	There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or early complication rates, but late complications were more frequent after rigid stenting (risk ratio=2. 47; 95% CI 1. 88-3. 04).
randomized controlled trial	There was a survival advantage for non-stent-treated patients (log-rank statistic=4. 21, P=0. 04).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The treatment choice for patients with inoperable esophageal cancer should be between a SEMS or a non-stent treatment after consideration has been given to both patient and tumor characteristics and clinician and patient preferences.
randomized controlled trial	A randomized controlled clinical trial of palliative therapies for patients with inoperable esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Fewer complications are encountered with the use of self-expanding metal stents compared with semirigid prostheses in the palliation of patients with malignant esophagogastric obstructions.
Case series	Metal stents can also be used to treat patients with complicated and/or recurrent esophagogastric carcinoma.
Case series	Methods: Covered metal stents were placed in 57 patients for the following reasons: esophagorespiratory fistula (n = 16), recurrent carcinoma in a gastric tube interposition (n = 21), recurrent carcinoma after partial (n = 4) or total (n = 6) gastrectomy, or a carcinoma near the upper esophageal sphincter (n = 10).
Case series	Results: The procedure was technically successful in 55 of 57 (96%) patients. Dysphagia score improved from a mean of 3. 6 to 1. 6 (p < 0. 001). Major complications occurred in 13 (23%) patients.
Case series	In all cases, esophagorespiratory fistulas were occluded.
Case series	Tumor recurred in 5 of 16 patients with a fistula, 8 of 21 patients after gastric tube interposition, 3 of 10 patients after gastrectomy, and 2 of 10 patients with a tumor immediately distal to the upper esophageal sphincter.
Case series	Median survival was 61 days. Prior radiation, chemotherapy, or both increased the risk of specific stent-related complications in relation to the (neo)esophagus (6 of 16 [38%] versus 4 of 41 [10%]: odds ratio, 5. 5: 95% CI [1. 3, 24], p = 0. 018).
Case series	Conclusions: Self-expanding metal stents are effective and relatively safe for palliation of patients with malignancy and dysphagia caused by fistula formation, postoperative recurrence, and tumors near the upper esophageal sphincter.
Case series	Placement should be considered at an early stage in these conditions.
Case series	Self-expanding metal stents for complicated and recurrent esophagogastric cancer
review	BACKGROUND: Cure of patients with esophageal cancer has remained rare over the past four decades. The overall five-year survival rate for squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus currently is reported as 12% in whites and 8% in blacks.
review	The five-year survival rate for localized disease at initial staging is only 26% for whites and 13% for blacks. With regional involvement, these rates are 11% and 7%, respectively.
review	METHODS: The author reviews the literature on optimal endoscopic lumen restoration techniques, including dilation, thermal laser and chemical ablation, photodynamic therapy, and stents.
review	Procedures for pain relief and nutritional support are also presented. RESULTS: Lumen restoration to relieve dysphagia and provide the opportunity for sustaining reasonable peroral nutrition is an essential element in the overall management.
review	Nonsurgical lumen restoration procedures have much to offer for dysphagia palliation and are briefly reviewed in this presentation.
review	The major options include ablation of intraluminal tumor mass by thermal laser, photodynamic laser, chemical ablation, peroral dilation, and placement of esophageal stents.
review	Most patients require more than one palliative method to sustain lumen patency during the course of their disease.
review	CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with esophageal cancer will require palliation for the multiple problems that develop during their limited life span.
review	The responsibility of the palliation therapist is to provide the patient with safe and cost-effective treatments that provide the best possible dysphagia relief.
review	Palliation of Dysphagia of Esophageal Cancer by Endoscopic Lumen Restoration Techniques
Case series	We retrospectively reviewed our experience with palliative dilation for dysphagia in esophageal carcinoma. During a 3-year period 26 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus underwent peroral esophageal dilation for relief of dysphagia.
Case series	Twenty-four were able to resume a soft or regular diet after dilation. This improvement was accomplished with low morbidity and no mortality.
Case series	Dilations were done without additional risk in patients with malignant tracheoesophageal fistulae and in patients undergoing radiation therapy.
Case series	We conclude that esophageal dilation can be done safely and effectively in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Palliative dilation can significantly improve the quality of life for these patients and should be considered an important part of their management plan.
Case series	Palliative dilation for dysphagia in esophageal carcinoma
Case series	The palliative effect of repeated endoscopic dilatation of malignant strictures of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction was prospectively evaluated in 41 patients.
Case series	Dilatation was performed with Eder-Puestow technique in brief general anesthesia. Substantial improvement in swallowing ability was experienced after each treatment.
Case series	The dysphagia recurred, however, and the dilatations were repeated at intervals of about 4 weeks. Most patients required less than or equal to three treatments during their remaining lifespan.
Case series	There were few complications, the most prominent being perforation (in 5% of 128 sessions). Only short hospital stay was required, and 18 patients remained at home during the periods between dilatations.
Case series	Endoscopic dilation of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction gives good palliation. The technique is simple, cheap and safe.
Case series	It is suitable for lesions at any site, not time-consuming, available at almost all endoscopy units, and consequently to be recommended in this clinical setting.
Case series	Palliative endoscopic dilatation in carcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction
Case series	Background: Traditionally, mercury-filled rubber bougies are used for dilation of simple or mild-to-moderate esophageal strictures, whereas through-the-scope balloon dilators and wire-guided polyvinyl bougies have become standard for more complex strictures.
Case series	Because few comparative trials are available, the choice of dilator and technique is largely based on the training and experience of the operator.
Case series	Methods: We reviewed 348 esophageal dilation procedures performed on a total of 142 patients over a 4-year period (January 1, 1993, to January 1, 1997).
Case series	The location and cause of stricture, the maximum diameter of the instrument used per session, the rate of perforation, and the rate of fluoroscopy use were recorded.
Case series	Results: Maloney, balloon (hydrostatic and pneumatic type), and Savary dilations were performed in 102, 156, and 90 sessions, respectively. Perforations occurred in 4 patients.
Case series	All of these perforations occurred when Maloney dilators were passed blindly into complex strictures (Fisher's exact test, p = 0. 011, two-tailed).
Case series	Three of these four patients had undergone endoscopy with conscious sedation immediately before the dilation. The immediate outcome of surgery was good in all 4 patients with no deaths.
Case series	Conclusion: Perforation was most commonly associated with the blind passage of Maloney bougies into complex strictures.
Case series	Comparison among the perforation rates of Maloney, balloon, and savary dilation of esophageal strictures
Case series	Esophageal carcinoma usually is diagnosed at an advanced, incurable stage. In patients with good operative risk, surgery is still considered the ideal treatment.
Case series	Patients with coexisting major medical conditions in whom resective surgery is precluded may benefit from several therapeutic options, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) with porfimer sodium (Photofrin; manufactured by Lederle Parenterals, Carolina, Puerto Rico, under license from Quadra Logic Technologies, Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), dilation, thermal destruction, Nd:YAG laser ablation, injection therapy, and placement of prosthetic tubes.
Case series	Photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium is thought to have a direct toxic effect on malignant cells via the production of singlet oxygen, which damages the microvasculature of the tumor and renders it ischemic.
Case series	The 630 nm wavelength used for clinical PDT exhibits the greatest relative degree of light penetration into tissue, with corresponding activation of retained photosensitizer.
Case series	The efficacy of PDT with porfimer sodium is closely related to stage of disease.
Case series	It should be emphasized that PDT has been shown to be potentially curative in patients with early, noninvasive tumors of both squamous and glandular (adenocarcinoma) histologies. Eighty-three patients with esophageal carcinoma were treated using PDT.
Case series	At presentation, 60% of patients had recurrence following previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients with less advanced disease had a better response to PDT with regard to relief of dysphagia and prolongation of survival.
Case series	Photodynamic therapy was found to be more useful than Nd:YAG laser therapy for high, upper third lesions, especially circumferential ones.
Case series	For tumors larger than 8 cm, PDT was twice as effective as Nd:YAG laser therapy in establishing prolonged lumen patency, especially for adenocarcinomas. Photodynamic therapy appears to have the added advantages of fewer treatments and less pain.
Case series	The role of PDT in gastrointestinal malignancies continues to evolve.
Case series	Photodynamic therapy and cancer of the esophagus
Case series	Background: We wanted to determine factors affecting survival rates of benefits to, and complications in patients with esophageal cancer treated with photodynamic therapy.
Case series	Methods: From 1982 to January 1994, we used photodynamic therapy to treat 77 patients with esophageal carcinoma and evaluated survival to July 1994.
Case series	All patients had failed, refused, or were ineligible for surgical intervention, ionizing radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Results: The only significant variable affecting survival was clinical stage.
Case series	Median survival after photodynamic therapy was as follows: all patients, 6. 3 months (mean survival, 9. 2 months); stage I, not reached; stage II, 12 months; stage III, 6. 2 months; and stage IV, 3. 5 months.
Case series	For stages III and IV, a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher had a significant effect. For stage III, the median survival was 6. 3 months when the Karnofsky performance status was equal to or greater than 70 and 3.
Case series	5 months when it was less than 70. For stage IV, the median survival was 5. 5 months when the Karnofsky performance status was equal to or greater than 70 and 2. 5 months when it was lower than 70.
Case series	Seven stage I patients with no treatment prior to photodynamic therapy had an estimated 5-year survival rate of 62%.
Case series	Three patients with stage I invasive adenocarcinoma and Barrett's mucosa diagnosed when they underwent endoscopy for dysphagia were alive with no evidence of disease 17, 44, and 59 months after photodynamic therapy.
Case series	Conclusions: Photodynamic therapy for esophageal carcinoma caused minimal complications and no procedure-related deaths.
Case series	Photodynamic therapy can be considered an alternative treatment for patients with Barrett's esophagus with severe dysplasia or patients with stage I carcinoma who are under consideration for operation but are high surgical risks.
Case series	The length of palliation for patients having "noncurative" treatment was equal to or better than that reported historically for most other treatment regimens.
Case series	Photodynamic therapy for esophageal malignancy: a prospective twelve-year study
Non-randomized controlled trial	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed promising efficacy for local failure after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for esophageal cancer. However, PDT required long sun shade period.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PDT using second generation photosensitizer, talaporfin sodium for local failure after CRT. This was the multi-institutional non-randomized phase II study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with histologically proven local failure limited within the muscularis propria after 50Gy or more radiotherapy (RT) for esophageal cancer were eligible. We set the primary endpoint as local complete response (L-CR) per patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	And, secondary endpoints were confirmed L-CR, local progression free survival (L-PFS), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), L-CR per lesions (Lesion L-CR), and confirmed Lesion L-CR.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The PDT procedure commenced with intravenous administration of a 40 mg/m2 dose of talaporfin sodium followed by diode laser irradiation at a 664 nm wavelength. 26 eligible patients were enrolled and all were treated with PDT.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Twenty three patients with 25 lesions were assessed L-CR after PDT; the L-CR rate per patients was 88. 5% (95% CI: 69. 8%-97. 6%). No skin phototoxicity was observed, and no grade 3 or worse non-hematological toxicities related to PDT were observed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	PDT using talaporfin sodium and a diode laser is a safe and curative salvage treatment for local failure after CRT or RT for patients with esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A multicenter phase II study of salvage photodynamic therapy using talaporfin sodium (ME2906) and a diode laser (PNL6405EPG) for local failure after chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy for esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a salvage treatment for local failure following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for esophageal cancer.
Case series	This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of salvage PDT using the second-generation photosensitizer, talaporfin sodium (L-PDT), and compare L-PDT to PDT using porfimer sodium (P-PDT).
Case series	Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes of patients treated with L-PDT and P-PDT.
Case series	Patients with histologically proven local failure limited to the shallow muscularis propria layer (T2) after CRT or radiotherapy (RT) for esophageal cancer were enrolled. Results: A total of 121 patients were enrolled in this study.
Case series	L-PDT and P-PDT groups consisted of 44 and 77 patients, respectively. The overall local complete response (L-CR) rate was 62. 1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52. 6-70. 9), and the L-PDT group showed a better L-CR rate than did the P-PDT group (69.
Case series	0% [95% CI 52. 9-82. 4] vs. 58. 1% [95% CI 46. 1-69. 5]). The common complications of skin phototoxicity, esophageal stricture, and esophageal fistula were all less frequent in the L-PDT group than in the P-PDT group.
Case series	The only treatment-related death in this study was in the P-PDT group. With a median follow-up period of 15. 8 months (interquartile range 7. 1-37.
Case series	4) in all 121 patients, overall survival rate at 1 year was significantly higher among patients who achieved L-CR (91. 2% [95% CI 80. 2-96. 3]) than among those who could not achieve L-CR with PDT (50. 8% [95% CI 33. 6-65. 6]).
Case series	Conclusions: L-PDT represented better short-term outcomes than P-PDT as a salvage treatment for local failure following CRT or RT for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Advantages of salvage photodynamic therapy using talaporfin sodium for local failure after chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy for esophageal cancer
review	Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a treatment of choice for cancer, induces a photochemical reaction, thereby eradicating tumor cells.
review	This is achieved through the administration of a photosensitizer drug, which is activated with a laser after localization to the tumor mass, and is an approved curative endoscopic ablative treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Japan.
review	PDT has been approved for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and as a palliative treatment for patients with symptomatic obstructive esophageal cancer in US.
review	However, its adverse events and complicated procedure and the development of alternative endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy, have largely limited the practice of PDT in esophageal cancer worldwide.
review	Recently, owing to the invention of second-generation PDT using talaporfin sodium and diode laser, PDT can be performed with less phototoxicity and therefore has regained popularity in the treatment of ESCC.
review	As a salvage treatment for patients with local failure after chemoradiotherapy (CRT), PDT has shown promising complete response with less phototoxicity and shorter sun shade period.
review	In addition, the efficacy and safety of PDT in patients with local failure of ESCC after CRT were shown in several clinical trials.
review	The direction of the study interest of the next-generation PDT is the safety and potential expansion of the indications for its application in the future.
review	This review covers the PDT for the treatment of ESCC and dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, with special focus on the role of PDT in practice for esophageal cancer.
review	Role of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a different type of laser treatment from Nd:YAG thermal ablation for palliation of dysphagia from esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this prospective, multicenter study, patients with advanced esophageal cancer were randomized to receive PDT with porfimer sodium and argon-pumped dye laser or Nd:YAG laser therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Two hundred thirty-six patients were randomized and 218 treated (PDT 110, Nd:YAG 108) at 24 centers. Improvement in dysphagia was equivalent between the two treatment groups.
randomized controlled trial	Objective tumor response was also equivalent at week 1, but at month 1 was 32% after PDT and 20% after Nd:YAG (p < 0. 05). Nine complete tumor responses occurred after PDT and two after Nd:YAG.
randomized controlled trial	Trends for improved responses for PDT were seen in tumors located in the upper and lower third of the esophagus, in long tumors, and in patients who had prior therapy.
randomized controlled trial	More mild to moderate complications followed PDT, including sunburn in 19% of patients. Perforations from laser treatments or associated dilations occurred after PDT in 1%, Nd:YAG 7% (p < 0. 05).
randomized controlled trial	Termination of laser sessions due to adverse events occurred in 3% with PDT and in 19% with Nd:YAG (p < 0. 05).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium has overall equal efficacy to Nd:YAG laser thermal ablation for palliation of dysphagia in esophageal cancer, and equal or better objective tumor response rate.
randomized controlled trial	Temporary photosensitivity is a limitation, but PDT is carried out with greater ease and is associated with fewer acute perforations than Nd:YAG laser therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium versus thermal ablation therapy with Nd:YAG laser for palliation of esophageal cancer: a multicenter randomized trial
Case series	Background/aims: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been adapted to the endoscopic treatment of digestive cancer, but its indications and efficacy remain uncertain.
Case series	The aim of this study was to assess its feasibility in the curative treatment of small esophageal tumors.
Case series	Methods: From 1983 to 1991, PDT was used to treat 123 patients with esophageal cancer who were recommended for nonsurgical treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (n = 104) and adenocarcinoma (n = 19).
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed in 88 patients; 61 were staged uT1 and 27 were staged uT2. A hematoporphyrin derivative was injected 72 hours before laser irradiation with a 630-nm dye laser.
Case series	PDT was applied alone in 56 patients and as part of a multimodal protocol in the 67 others. Results: The complete response rate at 6 months was 87%. The 5-year survival rate was 25% +/- 6%, and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 74% +/- 5%.
Case series	The complete response rate and survival rate were not different (1) between the PDT alone and the PDT multimodal treatment groups, (2) between the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma groups, and (3) between the uT1 and uT2 EUS groups.
Case series	PDT-related complications were esophageal stenosis (n = 43) and cutaneous photosensitization (n = 16). Conclusions: In patients with small esophageal tumors who pose high surgical risk, photodynamic therapy is an effective treatment.
Case series	Long-term survival after photodynamic therapy for esophageal cancer
Case series	Purpose: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown remarkable activity in a variety of human cancers. In the present study, we report the effects of PDT on inoperable early-stage esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods and materials: Sixty-two patients were treated with an argon dye laser (630 nm wavelength, 300-800 mW of power, energy dose of 200-300 J/cm) after intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg of hematoporphyrin derivative. Eighteen patients (29.
Case series	5%) had in situ carcinoma (Tis), 30 (48. 5%) had T1-stage cancer, 7 (11%) had T2-stage cancer, and 7 (11%) had recurrent disease in the anastomotic area after previous surgery without evidence of invasion outside the lumen.
Case series	Patients with residual disease after two rounds of PDT received definitive radiotherapy. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and survival. The follow-up time ranged from 3 to 90 months (median, 32 months).
Case series	Results: The complete response (CR) rate was 37% (23 of 62) in patients who received PDT alone and 82% (51 of 62) in those who also received radiotherapy. The CR rate after PDT alone was statistically higher (p = 0.
Case series	04) for patients who had Tis/T1 lesions (21 of 48; 44%) than for those with T2-stage disease (2 of 7; 28%) or recurrent tumors (0 of 7; 0%). Fifty-two percent of patients who had CR following PDT alone did not suffer local tumor recurrence.
Case series	The median local progression-free survival times after PDT and additional radiotherapy (in cases with incomplete response) was 49 months for Tis- and T1-stage lesions, 30 months for those with T2-stage disease, and 14 months for patients with locally recurrent disease.
Case series	Patients who completely responded to PDT had a median overall survival (OS) of 50 months, which was significantly longer (p < 0. 003) than that of patients not responding to PDT.
Case series	Toxicity was minimal; we recorded three cases of esophageal stenosis (7%) and one case of tracheo-esophageal fistula (2. 5%) after combined PDT and radiotherapy.
Case series	Conclusion: PDT is an effective regimen for early esophageal cancer, giving a CR rate of about 40%, long-term local control and favorable overall survival.
Case series	Additional radiotherapy in cases of incomplete response to PDT is effective and potentially curative in another 45% of cases.
Case series	Outcome of patients receiving photodynamic therapy for early esophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background and study aim: Argon plasma coagulation (APC) has become an established noncontact method of tumor palliation in a variety of locations.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The present prospective study evaluated a new APC system (APC-2) using amplified power settings and different application modes, such as intermittent energy delivery (pulsed APC) in comparison with the conventional technique (forced APC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: A total of 100 patients with esophageal, gastric, or rectal tumors were alternately (but not randomized) enrolled and treated with either pulsed APC (n = 46) or forced APC (n = 54).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Parameters to assess the palliative effect were: amount of lumen restoration ((1/3), (2/3), complete), objective planimetry, stenosis length, treatment time, and number of APC sessions.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Overall response rate was similar in both groups (pulsed 83 %, forced 87 %), the same was found in the subgroups with different amounts of lumen restoration and for the other objective parameters.
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, the tumor debulking effect was achieved in a significantly shorter median treatment time with forced compared with pulsed APC (13. 6 vs. 18. 2 minutes, P = 0. 03), with a similar number of treatment sessions in both groups.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Complications also occurred with similar frequency in both groups. Conclusions: There was no significant difference in overall local tumor response between the two modes of APC application.
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, data from this nonrandomized study suggest a faster achievement of response with forced APC. A combination of both modes may be superior.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Prospective nonrandomized comparison of two modes of argon beamer (APC) tumor desobstruction: effectiveness of the new pulsed APC versus forced APC
Cohort study	Background: Self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) are the main palliative modality used in inoperable oesophageal cancer. Other palliative modalities, including argon plasma coagulation (APC), have also been used.
Cohort study	Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the relative efficacy of SEMS and APC regarding the survival of patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer, not receiving chemo/radiotherapy.
Cohort study	Methods: Single centre, retrospective analysis of all patients (n = 228) with inoperable oesophageal cancer between January 2000 and July 2014, not receiving chemo-radiotherapy, treated with SEMS (n = 160) or APC (n = 68) as primary palliation modalities.
Cohort study	Cox regression analysis was performed to identify individual factors affecting survival and Kaplan-Meier curves were created for patients treated with APC and SEMS for stage III and IV disease. Survival intervals were compared by the log-rank test.
Cohort study	Results: Type of treatment was the only statistically significant factor affecting survival, after disease stage stratification (hazard ratio (HR): 1. 36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1. 13-1. 65 of SEMS over APC, p: 0. 002).
Cohort study	Median survival for patients treated with APC and SEMS was 257 (interquartile range (IQR): 414, 124) and 151 (IQR: 241, 61) days respectively in stage III disease. It was 135 (IQR: 238, 43) and 70 (IQR: 148, 32) days respectively in stage IV disease.
Cohort study	Both differences were statistically significant (p = 0. 02 and 0. 05 respectively). Conclusions: APC is a promising palliation modality in inoperable oesophageal cancer, when patients are not candidates for chemo-radiotherapy.
Cohort study	A randomized controlled trial will be needed to confirm those results.
Cohort study	Argon plasma coagulation compared with stent placement in the palliative treatment of inoperable oesophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Objectives: Because most esophageal cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, a majority of patients require palliative dysphagia treatment.
randomized controlled trial	Dysphagia severity and the need for repeated re-canalization procedures significantly affect patients' quality of life (QoL).
randomized controlled trial	The aim of this study was to establish whether combining argon plasma coagulation (APC) of the neoplastic esophageal tissue with another re-canalization method results in a longer dysphagia-free period compared with APC alone.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We conducted a randomized trial in 93 patients with malignant dysphagia. Patients were followed until death.
randomized controlled trial	We compared three regimens of esophageal re-canalization; APC combined with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, APC combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT), and APC alone.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome measure was the dysphagia-free period following randomization. Secondary measures were survival, QoL, treatment-associated complications, and treatment tolerance. A per-protocol analysis was carried out.
randomized controlled trial	Results: The time to first dysphagia recurrence was significantly different between each combination treatment group and the control group (overall test: P=0. 006; HDR vs. control, log-rank P=0. 002, PDT vs. control, log-rank P=0.
randomized controlled trial	036), but not different between the combination groups (HDR vs. PDT, log-rank P=0. 36). The median time to first dysphagia recurrence was 88, 59, and 35 days in the HDR, PDT, and control groups, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	There was no difference in overall survival between the study groups (P=0. 27). No deaths, perforations, hemorrhages, or fistula formations were attributed to treatment. The only major complication was fever, occurring in three PDT patients.
randomized controlled trial	Minor complications were observed significantly more often in the combination treatment groups and included pain in both groups, transient dysphagia worsening, and skin sensitivity in the PDT group.
randomized controlled trial	The QoL 30 days after treatment in the HDR group was significantly better than in the other groups.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: In patients with inoperable esophageal cancer, palliative combination treatment of dysphagia with APC and HDR or PDT was significantly more efficient than APC alone, and was safe and well tolerated.
randomized controlled trial	APC combined with HDR resulted in fewer complications and better QoL than APC with PDT or APC alone (CONSORT 1b).

Cohort study	Background: Esophageal carcinoma is the ninth most prevalent cancer worldwide with squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) and adenocarcinoma accounting for the vast majority of new cases (13,900 in 2003). Cure rates in the U. S.
Cohort study	are less than 10%, similar to lung cancer.
Cohort study	More than 50% of patients with esophageal carcinoma present with unresectable or metastatic disease, are not surgical candidates, or display disease progression despite the addition of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to surgery.
Cohort study	Need for improved palliation exits.
Cohort study	Case presentation: This case describes a 73-year-old African American male who presented with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the esophagus who has a achieved complete remission for 24 months via endoscopic cryospray ablation.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Endoscopic cryo spray ablation warrants further investigation as a palliative treatment modality for esophageal cancer. This is the first reported case in the medical literature.
Cohort study	Cryospray ablation (CSA) in the palliative treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
Cohort study	Background: Few options exist for patients with localized esophageal cancer ineligible for conventional therapies. Endoscopic spray cryotherapy with low-pressure liquid nitrogen has demonstrated efficacy in this setting in early studies.
Cohort study	Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy in esophageal carcinoma. Design: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Setting: Ten academic and community medical centers between 2006 and 2009.
Cohort study	Patients: Subjects with esophageal carcinoma in whom conventional therapy failed and those who refused or were ineligible for conventional therapy. Interventions: Cryotherapy with follow-up biopsies.
Cohort study	Treatment was complete when tumor eradication was confirmed by biopsy or when treatment was halted because of tumor progression, patient preference, or comorbid condition.
Cohort study	Main outcome measurements: Complete eradication of luminal cancer and adverse events. Results: Seventy-nine subjects (median age 76 years, 81% male, 94% with adenocarcinoma) were treated. Tumor stage included T1-60, T2-16, and T3/4-3.
Cohort study	Mean tumor length was 4. 0 cm (range 1-15 cm). Previous treatment including endoscopic resection, photodynamic therapy, esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy failed in 53 subjects (67%). Forty-nine completed treatment.
Cohort study	Complete response of intraluminal disease was seen in 31 of 49 subjects (61. 2%), including 18 of 24 (75%) with mucosal cancer. Mean (standard deviation) length of follow-up after treatment was 10. 6 (8. 4) months overall and 11. 5 (2.
Cohort study	8) months for T1 disease. No serious adverse events were reported. Benign stricture developed in 10 (13%), with esophageal narrowing from previous endoscopic resection, radiotherapy, or photodynamic therapy noted in 9 of 10 subjects.
Cohort study	Limitations: Retrospective study design, short follow-up. Conclusions: Spray cryotherapy is safe and well tolerated for esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Short-term results suggest that it is effective in those who could not receive conventional treatment, especially for those with mucosal cancer.
Cohort study	Endoscopic spray cryotherapy for esophageal cancer: safety and efficacy
Case series	Background and aims: Dysphagia is a debilitating symptom in patients with inoperable esophageal cancer that contributes to poor quality of life and worsening nutritional status.
Case series	The 2 most commonly used palliative modalities for dysphagia are radiation therapy and esophageal stent placement.
Case series	However, radiation therapy is limited by adverse events (AEs) and total dose, and stent placement has a high rate of AEs, including reflux, migration, and chest pain.
Case series	A relatively new modality of liquid nitrogen endoscopic spray cryotherapy has been described as salvage when other options have been exhausted and when patients are no longer receiving systemic therapy.
Case series	We evaluated the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy as the primary modality for relieving dysphagia in inoperable esophageal cancer including patients receiving systemic cancer therapy.
Case series	Methods: This is a retrospective, multicenter, consecutive case series of 49 inoperable esophageal cancer patients undergoing palliative endoscopic cryotherapy at 4 specialized cancer centers from May 2014 to May 2016.
Case series	The primary outcomes were change in dysphagia scores between pre- and postcryotherapy and AEs.
Case series	Dysphagia was measured using a 5-point Likert scale: 0, no dysphagia; 1, dysphagia to solids; 2, dysphagia to semisolids; 3, dysphagia to liquids; 4, dysphagia to saliva.
Case series	Results: Thirty-nine men and 10 women with a mean age of 58 years underwent a total of 120 cryotherapy treatments. The mean dysphagia score improved significantly from 2. 4 precryotherapy to 1. 7 postcryotherapy (improvement of. 7 points; P <. 001).
Case series	Minor AEs were seen in 6 of 120 (5. 0%) cryotherapy treatments (1 intraprocedural and 5 postprocedural).
Case series	In addition, 1 patient developed a severe intraprocedural AE of dilation-related perforation, whereas another patient developed a benign stricture requiring dilation.
Case series	Conclusions: This preliminary retrospective study suggests that liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy may be safe and effective for dysphagia palliation in inoperable esophageal cancer.
Case series	Large prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and identify patient and procedure characteristics associated with the greatest benefit.
Case series	Liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy for dysphagia palliation in patients with inoperable esophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To evaluate the response, toxicity, survival, and quality of life in patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer treated with weekly irinotecan and cisplatin.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Thirty-five patients with metastatic or unresectable esophageal adenocarcinoma (23 patients) or squamous cell carcinoma (12 patients) were treated. No prior chemotherapy was allowed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The majority of patients had metastatic and bidimensionally measurable disease (34 patients each [97%]). Patients were treated with cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) and irinotecan 65 mg/m(2), repeated weekly for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Treatment was recycled every 6 weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Degree of dysphagia relief was monitored, and quality of life was measured prospectively using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General instruments.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Thirty-five patients were assessable for response and toxicity. Major objective responses were observed in 20 patients (57%; 95% confidence interval, 41% to 73%), including two complete responses (6%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Similar response rates were observed for adenocarcinoma (12 of 23 patients; 52%) and squamous carcinoma (eight of 12 patients; 66%). The median duration of response was 4. 2 months (range, 1 to 8. 8+ months). Median actuarial survival was 14.
Non-randomized controlled trial	6 months (range, 1 to 15. 2+ months). In 20 patients with dysphagia assessable at baseline, 18 (90%) noted either improvement or resolution of dysphagia on chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Global quality of life improved in responding patients, primarily because of improvements in pain, emotional state, and relationships with family and friends.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Toxicity was relatively mild and included only three patients (9%) with grade 4 neutropenia and four (11%) with grade 3 diarrhea. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The combination of weekly cisplatin plus irinotecan had significant activity in metastatic esophageal carcinoma and resulted in significant relief of dysphagia.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The regimen was well tolerated, with acceptable myelosuppression and rare treatment-related diarrhea. Further evaluation of the combination of weekly irinotecan and cisplatin, including the addition of other agents to this regimen, is indicated.

review	Late gastrointestinal complications of radiation therapy have been recognized but not extensively studied. In this paper, the late effects of radiation on three gastrointestinal sites, the esophagus, the stomach, and the bowel, are described.
review	Esophageal dysmotility and benign stricture following esophageal irradiation are predominantly a result of damage to the esophageal wall, although mucosal ulcerations also may persist following high-dose radiation.
review	The major late morbidity following gastric irradiation is gastric ulceration caused by mucosal destruction.
review	Late radiation injury to the bowel, which may result in bleeding, frequency, fistula formation, and, particularly in small bowel, obstruction, is caused by damage to the entire thickness of the bowel wall, and predisposing factors have been identified.
review	For each site a description of the pathogenesis, clinical findings, and present management is offered.
review	Simple and reproducible endpoint scales for late toxicity measurement were developed and are presented for each of the three gastrointestinal organs.
review	Factors important in analyzing late complications and future considerations in evaluation and management of radiation-related gastrointestinal injury are discussed.

Case series	Background: We reviewed clinical results of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the treatment of patients with advanced esophageal cancer with fistulae that developed before or during CRT.
Case series	Methods and materials: The study group included 16 patients with fistulous esophageal cancer treated by means of CRT between 1999 and 2006. Nine patients had fistulae before CRT, whereas 7 developed fistulae during CRT.
Case series	The group included 12 men and four women with a median age of 55 years (range, 37-77 years). There were 9 patients with Stage III disease and 7 with Stage IV disease. All tumors were squamous cell carcinomas.
Case series	Two courses of concurrent chemotherapy were combined with radiation therapy; 60 Gy/30 fractions/7 weeks (1-week split).
Case series	For 15 patients, low-dose protracted chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (250-300 mg/m(2) x 14 days) and cisplatin (7 mg/m(2) x 10 days) was administered, whereas full-dose cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil were administered to the remaining patient.
Case series	Results: The planned dose of 60 Gy was delivered to 11 patients (69%), whereas radiation therapy was terminated early in 5 patients (40-58 Gy) because of acute toxicities, including two treatment-related deaths.
Case series	Disappearance of fistulae was noted during or after CRT in 7 patients (44%). All three esophagomediastinal fistulae were closed, but only four of 13 esophagorespiratory fistulae were closed by CRT.
Case series	For patients with Stage III, 1- and 2-year survival rates were 33% and 22%, respectively. Median survival time was 8. 5 months. Conclusion: Despite significant toxicity, concurrent CRT appears effective at closing esophageal malignant fistulae.
Case series	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer with malignant fistula
Cohort study	Background: Esophageal cancer patients with M1a disease are reported to have poor survival.
Cohort study	We hypothesized that patients with celiac lymph node metastases (CLN) identified by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) would predict a cohort with significantly worse survival postoperatively.
Cohort study	Accurate preoperative identification of this group will facilitate future adjuvant studies. Methods: During the study period, 211 patients with esophageal cancer underwent EUS staging.
Cohort study	Patients with evaluable celiac axis (n = 182) were included in this study. Survival of patients with and without CLNs was compared and the factors affecting overall survival were assessed.
Cohort study	A subgroup analysis based on CLN status was performed in the subgroup of patients who underwent surgical procedures. Results: Follow-up data was available in 91. 2% (166 of 182) of the patients.
Cohort study	As staged by EUS, T1, T2, T3, and T4 tumors accounted for 9. 3%, 11. 5%, 56%, and 21% of the cases, respectively. At least one CLN was imaged by EUS in 40% (72 of 182).
Cohort study	The 5-year survival in patients with CLNs detected by EUS was 13% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 21%) compared with 30% (95% confidence interval, 21% to 40%) in patients with no CLNs detected by EUS (p = 0. 007).
Cohort study	In the subgroup of patients who underwent surgical procedures (n = 68), patients with CLN involvement had worse survival compared with those who did not have malignant involvement of CLNs at the time of their operation (median survival 39.
Cohort study	8 versus 13. 8 months, p = 0. 0008). In a Cox proportional model, adjusting for race and the type of therapy, patients with CLN involvement or advanced EUS American Joint Committee on Cancer stage were more likely to have worse survival (p < 0.
Cohort study	05) Conclusions: EUS base line findings correlate with long term survival in patients with esophageal cancer. Patients with M1a disease as identified by EUS had a significantly worse postoperative survival when compared with non-M1a patients.
Cohort study	This cohort of patients will be ideal for the study of induction therapy since the effect of down staging can be assessed before operation.
Cohort study	Predictors of survival for esophageal cancer patients with and without celiac axis lymphadenopathy: impact of staging endosonography
review	Currently, relatively safe, reliable resection techniques are available for most patients with esophageal carcinoma who present with nonmetastatic disease.
review	For optimal results, the surgeon must be familiar with both transhiatal and transthoracic approaches and must individualize the approach depending on the tumor size and location and the patient's functional status.
review	Whereas post-resection survival rates are good for patients with early-stage disease (Stage I or IIa), most patients present with locally advanced, Stage III disease.
review	Although some progress has been made in the past decade in regard to early diagnosis among patients with Barrett's metaplasia undergoing endoscopic surveillance and additional progress has been made in adapting multimodality treatment programs successfully to patients with locally advanced disease, the overall cure rate for patients with esophageal carcinoma remains low.
review	Esophageal resection for cancer
Case series	The early and late results of bypass surgery in 124 patients with unresectable oesophageal cancer are reported.
Case series	Patients were grouped according to the extent of disease: group A, tumour localized to the oesophagus where severe pulmonary disease contra-indicated oesophagectomy (n = 9); group B, tumour less than or equal to 10 cm in length with mediastinal invasion (n = 81); group C, tumour greater than 10 cm in length with mediastinal invasion and/or fixed malignant lymph nodes (n = 33).
Case series	Extent of disease was not recorded in one patient. The operative mortality was 4 per cent but 9 other patients died in hospital (hospital mortality, 11 per cent).
Case series	Mortality was increased in patients undergoing colon bypass and in those with a large tumour load but these differences failed to reach statistical significance.
Case series	The most frequent complication was neck sepsis, secondary to leakage from the proximal end of the excluded oesophagus.
Case series	Eighty-nine per cent of the survivors could eat a normal, unrestricted diet on discharge and eighty-two per cent of survivors had complete and lasting relief from dysphagia.
Case series	Median survival after bypass was 5 months but survival was significantly improved by radiotherapy to the tumour (P less than 0. 001).
Case series	Gastric bypass with radiotherapy is indicated in patients with extra-oesophageal spread of malignancy and in patients with tumours localized to the oesophagus who are unfit for resection.
Case series	Bypass surgery may be contra-indicated in patients with a primary tumour greater than 10 cm in length and/or fixed lymph node metastases because mortality is increased and survival after operation is short.
Case series	Bypass surgery for unresectable oesophageal cancer: early and late results in 124 cases
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The present intergroup phase III randomized study compared combined chemotherapy (CT) plus radiotherapy (RT) treatment versus RT only in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Materials and methods: Two courses of chemotherapy during 50 Gy RT followed by additional two courses of the same CT, versus 64 Gy RT alone were investigated.
randomized controlled trial	CT consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 [corrected] and fluorouracil (5FU) 1,000 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 4 every 4 weeks with RT and every 3 weeks post-RT.
randomized controlled trial	The main objective of the study was to compare overall survival between the two randomized treatment groups. Patients were stratified by tumor size, histology, and degree of weight loss.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Sixty-two assessable patients were randomized to receive RT alone, and 61 to the combined arm.
randomized controlled trial	Patients characteristics were as follows: squamous cell cancer, 90% versus 85%; weight loss greater than 10 lb, 61% versus 69%; and tumor size, > or = 5 cm, 82% versus 80% on the RT and CT-RT arms, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Systemic side effects, which consisted of nausea, vomiting, and renal and myelosuppression, occurred more frequently on the combined arm, while local side effects were similar in both groups.
randomized controlled trial	With a minimum follow-up time of 5 years for all patients, the median survival duration was 14. 1 months and the 5-year survival rate was 27% in the combined treatment group, while the median survival duration was 9.
randomized controlled trial	3 months with no patients alive at 5 years in the RT-alone group (P <. 0001). Additional patients (69) were treated with the same combined therapy and were analyzed.
randomized controlled trial	The results of the last group confirmed all of the results obtained with combined CT-RT in the randomized trial, with a median survival duration of 17. 2 months and 3-year survival rate of 30%.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: We conclude that cisplatin and 5FU infusion given during and post-RT of 50 Gy is statistically superior to standard 64-Gy RT alone in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Progress report of combined chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with esophageal cancer: an intergroup study
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To compare the local/regional control, survival, and toxicity of combined-modality therapy using high-dose (64. 8 Gy) versus standard-dose (50. 4 Gy) radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: A total of 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to T4, N0/1, M0 squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma selected for a nonsurgical approach, after stratification by weight loss, primary tumor size, and histology, were randomized to receive combined-modality therapy consisting of four monthly cycles of fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 4 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) bolus day 1) with concurrent 64.
randomized controlled trial	8 Gy versus the same chemotherapy schedule but with concurrent 50. 4 Gy. The trial was stopped after an interim analysis. The median follow-up was 16. 4 months for all patients and 29. 5 months for patients still alive.
randomized controlled trial	Results: For the 218 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in median survival (13. 0 v 18.
randomized controlled trial	1 months), 2-year survival (31% v 40%), or local/regional failure and local/regional persistence of disease (56% v 52%) between the high-dose and standard-dose arms.
randomized controlled trial	Although 11 treatment-related deaths occurred in the high-dose arm compared with two in the standard-dose arm, seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients who had received 50. 4 Gy or less.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local/regional control.
randomized controlled trial	Although there was a higher treatment-related mortality rate in the patients assigned to the high-dose radiation arm, it did not seem to be related to the higher radiation dose.
randomized controlled trial	The standard radiation dose for patients treated with concurrent 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy is 50. 4 Gy.
randomized controlled trial	INT 0123 (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 94-05) phase III trial of combined-modality therapy for esophageal cancer: high-dose versus standard-dose radiation therapy
randomized controlled trial	Background: The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer is not well established.
randomized controlled trial	We compared chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in this patient population.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We randomly assigned patients with resectable tumors to receive surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (41.
randomized controlled trial	4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery.
randomized controlled trial	Results: From March 2004 through December 2008, we enrolled 368 patients, 366 of whom were included in the analysis: 275 (75%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23%) had squamous-cell carcinoma, and 7 (2%) had large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Of the 366 patients, 178 were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, and 188 to surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	The most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group were leukopenia (6%) and neutropenia (2%); the most common major nonhematologic toxic effects were anorexia (5%) and fatigue (3%).
randomized controlled trial	Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92% of patients in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69% in the surgery group (P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4% in both.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 49. 4 months in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 24. 0 months in the surgery group. Overall survival was significantly better in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.
randomized controlled trial	657; 95% confidence interval, 0. 495 to 0. 871; P=0. 003). Conclusions: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	The regimen was associated with acceptable adverse-event rates. (Funded by the Dutch Cancer Foundation [KWF Kankerbestrijding]; Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR487. ).
randomized controlled trial	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for esophageal or junctional cancer
Case series	The treatment results of the Rotterdam working group on esophageal cancer during the period January 1970-January 1978 were assessed. A total number of 328 patients were treated: 230 males and 98 females.
Case series	Of the 133 patients eligible for a combined treatment modality i. e. preoperative radiotherapy and surgery, 52 showed irresectable or metastatic disease during operation.
Case series	The five year actuarial survival rate of the 81 patients, in whom curative surgical resection of the tumor was performed, amounted to 21%. Females fared better than males, the five year survivals being 42% and 12% respectively.
Case series	This female preponderance in survival is partly explained by the considerable postoperative mortality of the male patients: 28% vs 7. 4% in females.
Case series	Patients who received only radiation therapy, whether curative or palliative, had a very bad prognosis. It is concluded that preoperative irradiation followed by surgical removal of the tumor should be performed in all operable-curable patients.
Case series	Carcinoma of the esophagus: results of treatment
Case series	This is an analysis of treatment results over a 23-year period in 241 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	The treatment for unresectable patients was external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone (mean dose 55 Gy) in 137 (57%) combined with brachytherapy (mean dose 50 + 40 Gy) in 46 (19%), and chemotherapy alone in 3 (1%) patients.
Case series	In the 55 resectable patients, treatment was resection alone in 9 (4%), and combined with radiotherapy (mean dose 43 Gy) in 46 (19%) patients. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival for the 241 patients was 36, 15, and 5%, respectively (median 38 weeks).
Case series	The 5-year survival was 18% for radiotherapy (RT)-surgery (S) patients, 11% for EBRT with brachytherapy, 2% for EBRT alone, and 0% for patients who had S alone, p less than 0. 001.
Case series	Survival correlated well with initial performance status, treatment, stage of disease, tumor size, radiation dose, and degree of response, p less than 0. 001, but not with tumor location in the esophagus and patients' race and sex, p = 0. 44.
Case series	Serious complications occurred in 5 (2%) patients treated with RT alone and in 4 (7%) patients treated with S alone or combined with RT. The leading cause of death was persistent or recurrent tumor in the chest found in 39% patients.
Case series	Management of carcinoma of the esophagus: the role of radiotherapy
randomized controlled trial	Background: The efficacy of conventional treatment with surgery and radiation for cancer of the esophagus is limited. The median survival is less than 10 months, and less than 10 percent of patients survive for 5 years.
randomized controlled trial	Recent studies have suggested that combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy may result in improved survival.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This phase III prospective, randomized, and stratified trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of four courses of combined fluorouracil (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area daily for four days) and cisplatin (75 mg per square meter on the first day) plus 5000 cGy of radiation therapy, as compared with 6400 cGy of radiation therapy alone, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus.
randomized controlled trial	The trial was stopped after the accumulated results in 121 patients demonstrated a significant advantage for survival in the patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Results: The median survival was 8.
randomized controlled trial	9 months in the radiation-treated patients, as compared with 12. 5 months in the patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
randomized controlled trial	In the former group, the survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 33 percent and 10 percent, respectively, whereas they were 50 percent and 38 percent in the patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Seven patients in the radiotherapy group and 25 in the combined-therapy group were alive at the time of the analysis. The patients who received combined treatment had fewer local (P less than 0. 02) and fewer distant (P less than 0. 01) recurrences.
randomized controlled trial	Severe and life-threatening side effects occurred in 44 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the patients who received combined therapy, as compared with 25 percent and 3 percent of those treated with radiation alone.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Concurrent therapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil and radiation is superior to radiation therapy alone in patients with localized carcinoma of the esophagus, as measured by control of local tumors, distant metastases, and survival, but at the cost of increased side effects.
randomized controlled trial	Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with cancer of the esophagus
Cohort study	A group of 127 patients with esophageal cancer treated with radiotherapy at different dose levels was retrospectively analysed. It was found that 70.
Cohort study	5% of the patients showed improvement of dysphagia and that 54% remained palliated with respect to food passage until their death.
Cohort study	The two major prognostic variables with respect to the palliative effect on dysphagia as well as survival were the passage score and the radiation dose. Patients with severe dysphagia (PASS 0 or 1) had a median actuarial DFI and SURV of 3. 7 and 6.
Cohort study	4 months, respectively, in contrast to 16. 0 and 8. 7 months for patients who were able to use (semi)solid food (PASS 2 and 3). The median actuarial DFI and SURV of patients treated with a relatively low dose (less than 50 Gy in 5 weeks) were 2.
Cohort study	5 and 4. 8 months, respectively, compared to 10. 1 and 8. 3 months, respectively, for patients treated with a relatively high dose.
Cohort study	The effect of radiotherapy on dysphagia and survival in patients with esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Between 1983 and 1989, 211 patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus were randomised in a study comparing split-course irradiation (two courses of 20 Gy in five fractions of 4 Gy, separated by a rest of 2 weeks) (arm A) and the same split-course irradiation in combination with cisplatin (CDDP) (3-4 days before each of the two courses of radiotherapy, repeated every 3-4 weeks, for a total of six cycles) (arm B).
randomized controlled trial	The Cox's regression model with retrospective stratification was used to compare the two arms to correct for the imbalance at randomisation of the T classification. The median overall survival was 7. 9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7. 3-9.
randomized controlled trial	4) months in arm A and 9. 6 (95% CI 8-13. 5) months in arm B. The difference in overall survival was only borderline significant (P=0. 048) with a reduction of the instantaneous rate of death of 24%.
randomized controlled trial	The 1 and 2 year overall survival rate were respectively 29% (95% CI 21-37%) and 15% (95% CI 8-22%) in arm A and 45% (95% CI 36-54%) and 20% (95% CI 13-27%) in arm B; thereafter, the survival curves became similar.
randomized controlled trial	The median progression free survival (PFS) was 5. 0 (95% CI 4. 6-5. 7) versus 6. 9 (95% CI 5. 3-8. 7) months (P=0. 028) and the median time to local progression was 6. 2 (95% CI 5. 1-7. 6) months versus 10. 9 (95% CI 8. 1-15. 5) months (P=0.
randomized controlled trial	018), respectively, in arms A and B. Haematological toxicities were slightly more commonly observed in the combined group (1% versus 6%).
randomized controlled trial	This study shows that split-course irradiation in combination with CDDP is very well tolerated and should be preferred to radiotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Prospective randomised study of split-course radiotherapy versus cisplatin plus split-course radiotherapy in inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus
randomized controlled trial	Background: Initial results of the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) comparing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction showed a significant increase in 5-year overall survival in favour of the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group after a median of 45 months' follow-up.
randomized controlled trial	In this Article, we report the long-term results after a minimum follow-up of 5 years.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients with clinically resectable, locally advanced cancer of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction (clinical stage T1N1M0 or T2-3N0-1M0, according to the TNM cancer staging system, sixth edition) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with permuted blocks of four or six to receive either weekly administration of five cycles of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (intravenous carboplatin [AUC 2 mg/mL per min] and intravenous paclitaxel [50 mg/m(2) of body-surface area] for 23 days) with concurrent radiotherapy (41·4 Gy, given in 23 fractions of 1·8 Gy on 5 days per week) followed by surgery, or surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention-to-treat. No adverse event data were collected beyond those noted in the initial report of the trial.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR487, and has been completed.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between March 30, 2004, and Dec 2, 2008, 368 patients from eight participating centres (five academic centres and three large non-academic teaching hospitals) in the Netherlands were enrolled into this study and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 180 to surgery plus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and 188 to surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	Two patients in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group withdrew consent, so a total of 366 patients were analysed (178 in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 188 in the surgery alone group).
randomized controlled trial	Of 171 patients who received any neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in this group, 162 (95%) were able to complete the entire neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen.
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up for surviving patients of 84·1 months (range 61·1-116·8, IQR 70·7-96·6), median overall survival was 48·6 months (95% CI 32·1-65·1) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 24·0 months (14·2-33·7) in the surgery alone group (HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·53-0·88]; log-rank p=0·003).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival for patients with squamous cell carcinomas was 81·6 months (95% CI 47·2-116·0) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 21·1 months (15·4-26·7) in the surgery alone group (HR 0·48 [95% CI 0·28-0·83]; log-rank p=0·008); for patients with adenocarcinomas, it was 43·2 months (24·9-61·4) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 27·1 months (13·0-41·2) in the surgery alone group (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·55-0·98]; log-rank p=0·038).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Long-term follow-up confirms the overall survival benefits for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy when added to surgery in patients with resectable oesophageal or oesophagogastric junctional cancer.
randomized controlled trial	This improvement is clinically relevant for both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma subtypes.
randomized controlled trial	Therefore, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy according to the CROSS trial followed by surgical resection should be regarded as a standard of care for patients with resectable locally advanced oesophageal or oesophagogastric junctional cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone for oesophageal or junctional cancer (CROSS): long-term results of a randomised controlled trial
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Major goals of concurrent radiation and chemotherapy in the treatment of esophageal cancer are the early restoration and long-term maintenance of swallowing function.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of concurrent radiation and chemotherapy on swallowing function.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Between September 1980 and September 1990, 120 patients with esophageal cancer were treated at the Fox Chase Cancer Center on the basis of one of three prospective nonrandomized protocols using concurrent chemotherapy and radiation.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Swallowing function was retrospectively assessed in these patients by use of a swallowing-function scoring system. In addition, patients who had long-term control of their esophageal cancer underwent a more detailed analysis of swallowing function.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Initial improvement in dysphagia occurred in 88% of the 102 assessable patients, with a median time to improvement of 2 weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	There was no difference in overall percentage of initial improvement for patients with adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with distal tumors, however, showed both earlier and higher frequency of initial improvement than did patients with tumors in the upper two-thirds of the thoracic esophagus (95% versus 79%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Local relapse-free survival of definitively treated patients at 3 years was 60% and was significantly better for patients with Stage I (76%) versus Stage II cancers (55%) (P < 0. 05).
Non-randomized controlled trial	All 25 patients treated with curative intent who survived for more than 1 year without evidence of disease were able to eat soft or solid foods and had a benign stricture rate of only 12%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Even in patients with advanced disease who were treated with palliative intent, 91% had an initial improvement in swallowing function and 67% had improvement in swallowing function that lasted until death.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: High-dose concurrent radiation and chemotherapy provides rapid improvement in dysphagia, and this improvement results in normal or near-normal swallowing function of long duration.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Swallowing function in patients with esophageal cancer treated with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy
Cohort study	Purpose: The records of patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with a combined modality therapy were reviewed to determine the effects of simultaneously administered chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) at sites of recurrence and the relationship between treatment outcome and clinicopathologic variables.
Cohort study	Patients and methods: One hundred seventeen patients were treated with fluorouracil (800 mg/m2) [corrected] and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) combined with either 36 Gy (36 patients) or 54 to 60 Gy (35 patients) of RT as sole therapy.
Cohort study	Forty-six patients underwent surgery after they had received chemotherapy and 36 Gy of RT as initial treatment. Patients with either squamous cell cancer (SCC) or adenocarcinoma were included.
Cohort study	Results: Complete endoscopic regression after an initial 36 Gy of RT and chemotherapy occurred in more than 50% of patients and in both tumor types. Relief of dysphagia accompanied tumor regression.
Cohort study	Forty-two tumors were resected, and 11 showed a complete histologic response.
Cohort study	Significant associations were demonstrated between enhanced survival and a diagnosis of SCC, a complete endoscopic response to initial chemotherapy and RT, and a tumor length of less than 5 cm.
Cohort study	Multivariate analyses suggested that tumor length and complete endoscopic response were independent prognostic variables. The survival rate of patients treated by resection or radical-dosage RT was not significantly different.
Cohort study	Conclusions: The relief of dysphagia demonstrates the palliative value of chemotherapy and RT in both tumor types.
Cohort study	The similar survival rates of patients with SCC or adenocarcinoma treated either surgically or with high-dose combined therapy (54 to 60 Gy) emphasize the need to evaluate the role of surgery and combined treatment in randomized studies.
Cohort study	Patterns of treatment failure and prognostic factors associated with the treatment of esophageal carcinoma with chemotherapy and radiotherapy either as sole treatment or followed by surgery
Case-control study	Background: We evaluated the role of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with inoperable squamous esophageal cancer. Methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous esophageal carcinoma who received CRT were recruited.
Case-control study	The CRT consists of continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil at 200 mg/m(2)/day, and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 22, with concurrent radiotherapy for a total of 50 to 60 Gy in 25 to 30 fractions over 6 weeks.
Case-control study	Efficacy was assessed by endoscopy and computed tomographic scan before and 8 weeks after completion of the treatment program.
Case-control study	Median survival and the need for palliative esophageal stenting were compared with another group of patients who received endoscopic stenting. Results: From 1996 to 2003, a total of 36 consecutive patients (33 male, mean +/- SD age 63. 2 +/- 9.
Case-control study	5 years) with T4 disease (81%) with or without cervical nodal metastasis (50%) received CRT, while 36 patients treated with endoscopic stenting alone were recruited as controls.
Case-control study	Both groups were comparable in demographics, pretreatment dysphagia score, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics. CRT was completed in 32 patients (89%). There was no treatment-related mortality.
Case-control study	Tumor volume was greatly reduced after CRT in 19 patients. Four patients (11%) received salvage esophagectomy 9 to 42 months after CRT. Compared with the stenting group, CRT statistically significantly improved 5-year survival (15% vs. 0%, P =.
Case-control study	01), median survival (10. 8 months vs. 4. 0 months, P <. 005), and need for stenting (22% vs. 100%, P =. 005). Conclusions: Palliative CRT can effectively improve the symptoms of dysphagia in patients with inoperable squamous esophageal carcinoma.
Case-control study	It results in better survival compared with endoscopic stenting in these patients.
Case-control study	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy or endoscopic stenting for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus: a case-control study
Case series	Objective: To retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of palliative chemoradiotherapy in Stage IVB esophageal cancer patients with dysphagia due to the primary lesion.
Case series	Methods: Forty patients with dysphagia caused by metastatic esophageal cancer, which had been treated between January 2004 and June 2009, were retrospectively investigated.
Case series	The treatment consisted of two courses of chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) and concurrent irradiation of 40 Gy in 20 fractions to the esophageal primary tumor.
Case series	The grade of dysphagia was evaluated; nutrition-support-free survival was evaluated using the status of nutritional support of patients. Response to treatment, overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicities were also evaluated.
Case series	Results: Dysphagia score improved in 75% of the patients. Seventeen of the 20 patients (85%) who had required nutritional support at baseline improved their oral intake to no longer need the support, in a median time of 43 days.
Case series	The median nutrition-support-free survival was 301 days in the 20 patients who had had adequate oral intake before the treatment. Disease control rate of the primary lesion was 95%, including 12 patients (30%) who achieved a complete response.
Case series	The overall response rate was 55%. The median survival was 308 days, and the 1-year-survival rate was 45. 0%. The median progression-free survival was 139 days. Toxicities were generally well tolerated.
Case series	Major toxicities (Grade 3 or 4) involved hemoglobin (23%), leukocytes (15%), neutrophils (20%), anorexia (10%), nausea (3%), esophageal perforation (5%) and febrile neutropenia (3%). Two patients (5%) died within 30 days of terminating radiotherapy.
Case series	Conclusions: Palliative chemoradiotherapy using 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin combined with concurrent 40 Gy irradiation effectively improved the symptom of dysphagia in Stage IVB esophageal cancer with acceptable toxicity and favorable survival.
Case series	Efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy as a palliative treatment in stage IVB esophageal cancer patients with dysphagia
Case series	Background: It remains controversial whether chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are/is contraindicated for esophageal carcinoma patients with malignant fistulae.
Case series	In some case reports, closure of fistulae by chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been reported. The current study investigated chemoradiotherapy for these patients using various primary treatments to manage the pulmonary complications.
Case series	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma with malignant fistulae.
Case series	Methods: Patients with endoscopically or radiologically confirmed fistulae were treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Closure of fistulae was assessed by esophagography or endoscopy. Oral food intake also was assessed before and after treatment.
Case series	Results: Of 202 esophageal carcinoma patients treated at National Cancer Center Hospital East between July 1992 and May 1998, 24 patients (11. 9%) developed malignant fistulae.
Case series	Twelve patients developed fistulae before treatment and the remaining patients developed fistulae during treatment. Closure of the fistulae after chemoradiotherapy was observed in 17 of these patients (70. 8%), and 16 of these 17 patients (94.
Case series	1%) had oral alimentation restored after successful treatment.
Case series	The median survival time from the diagnosis of the fistula for all patients with fistulae was 198 days; in the patients whose fistulae were present before chemoradiotherapy, the median survival time was 238 days.
Case series	Conclusions: These results suggest that the presence of malignant fistulae does not contraindicate chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Once the inflammation due to the fistula has been controlled, chemoradiotherapy should be utilized because it may provide the best chance for survival and palliation of severe dysphagia.
Case series	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma patients with malignant fistulae
Case series	Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of airway complications and survival with special reference to radiation therapy in the care of patients undergoing covered stent placement for malignant esophageal strictures.
Case series	Materials and methods: A total of 208 patients who underwent stent placement with or without palliative radiation therapy for inoperable esophageal cancer were included.
Case series	The endpoints were frequency, type, and management of airway complications; association between occurrence of airway complications and radiation therapy history; and differences in stent-to-complication interval and survival period after esophageal stenting between patients who underwent radiation therapy before and those who underwent radiation therapy after stent placement.
Case series	Results: Airway complications occurred in 23 patients (11. 1%): 18 (78. 3%) had esophagorespiratory fistula, three (13. 0%) had airway narrowing, and two (8. 7%) had both complications.
Case series	The frequency of airway complications was significantly greater among patients who underwent RT than those who did not (p = 0. 005) but was not significantly different between the radiation before stenting and radiation after stenting groups (p = 0.
Case series	158). The median stent-to-complication interval and survival period after esophageal stenting were significantly shorter in the radiation before stenting group than in the radiation after stenting group (p = 0. 002, p = 0. 001).
Case series	Conclusion: Esophagorespiratory fistula is much more common than airway narrowing as an airway complication. The rate of complications increases significantly in association with radiation therapy among patients with malignant esophageal stricture.
Case series	Clinicians need to be aware of earlier airway complications and poorer prognosis among patients who undergo radiation therapy before placement of an esophageal stent than in patients who undergo radiation after stent placement.
Case series	Airway complications after covered stent placement for malignant esophageal stricture: special reference to radiation therapy
Case series	Background: Patients with malignant esophagorespiratory fistulas have a poor prognosis. Treatment is palliative and involves restoration of the ability to ingest food and prevention of aspiration by insertion of esophageal or tracheobronchial stents.
Case series	Because insertion of a single stent may be insufficient for palliation, a series of patients who underwent parallel stent insertion were studied.
Case series	Methods: Thirteen patients with esophagorespiratory fistulas who required parallel stents were studied retrospectively.
Case series	Palliation was evaluated by assessing dyspnea, dysphagia, and coughing associated with eating and/or drinking before and after insertion of stents.
Case series	Observations: Insertion of the first stent (n = 13) resulted in complete relief of symptoms attributed to an esophagorespiratory fistula in 46% and in a reduction in symptoms in 54% of patients.
Case series	The interval between insertion of the first and second stents ranged from 1 to 182 days (mean 46 days). Insertion of the second stent (n = 12) resulted in complete relief of symptoms in 42% and a reduction in symptoms in 58% of the patients.
Case series	Conclusion: Parallel stent insertion may be indicated in patients with symptoms caused by malignant esophagorespiratory fistula.

review	This article addresses the treatment of malignant enterorespiratory fistulas, especially malignant tracheoesophageal fistula (mTEF). mTEF typically occurs after radiochemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.
review	Life expectancy is measured in months after successful treatment, and in days to weeks with a persistent fistula.
review	To stop repeated episodes of aspiration and septic pneumonia, single or double stenting of the esophagus and trachea with self-expandable coated stents is the established palliative treatment.
review	The indications, techniques, and pitfalls of esophageal and tracheal stenting are described. Surgical interventions are justified only in very select cases, so this article focuses on interventional rather than surgical treatment.
review	Treatment of malignant tracheoesophageal fistula
Case series	The purpose of the study reported in this article was to tabulate the incidence and etiologic factors of importance in the development of strictures after radiotherapy for carcinoma of the esophagus and to analyze the outcome of patients who develop such strictures.
Case series	Eighty patients were treated with radiotherapy, 50 having radical and 30 having palliative treatment.
Case series	Sixty-nine patients had squamous cell carcinoma, four had adenocarcinoma, one had sarcoma, one had mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and five had undifferentiated tumors.
Case series	Forty percent developed no stricture, 30% had benign fibrotic stricture, and 28% developed malignant stricture.
Case series	The etiologic factors analysed included age, pretreatment swallowing score, histology and length (size) of tumor; stage of disease, dose of radiotherapy, and use of chemotherapy. None of these factors were shown to be of etiologic importance.
Case series	The survival of patients who developed benign strictures was found to be significantly longer (1-year survival 88%) than those who developed no stricture (50%) or malignant stricture (19%).
Case series	Using a "success score" for palliation of dysphagia, it was found that the majority of patients (71%) who developed a benign stricture had a moderately successful outcome--they were able to tolerate a full or soft diet and required dilatation with a median duration between dilatations of 5 months.
Case series	Patients who developed a malignant stricture were palliated poorly by dilatation alone, and most required esophageal intubation.
Case series	Swallowing performance after radiation therapy for carcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	A phase II study of chemoradiotherapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus was carried out cooperatively by nine Japanese institutions.
Case series	Forty-five patients with thoracic advanced squamous cell carcinoma, who had T4 tumor or distant lymph node metastasis (M1(LYM)), were enrolled in the study for treatment with cisplatin (70 mg/m2) on days 1 and 36, and 5-fluorouracil infusion (700 mg/m2) on days 1-4 and 36-39 sandwiched around external beam irradiation (60 Gy over 6 weeks).
Case series	Of the 45 evaluable patients, 37 (84. 1%) completed the treatment. The overall response rate was 64. 4%, and the complete response rate 8. 9%. The median duration of response was 125. 0 days for patients who achieved complete and partial response.
Case series	The 50% median survival time was 215 days. There was one toxicity-related death due to radiation pneumonitis.
Case series	The major form of toxicity exceeding grade 2 was myelosuppression and anorexia, but grade 4 toxicity was also observed (2 pulmonary, 1 severe hypoxemia, 1 severe cardiac failure and 1 mental disturbance).
Case series	The results showed that this form of chemoradiotherapy had a satisfactory effect and might be useful for treatment of inoperable advanced esophageal cancer.
Case series	Phase II study of chemoradiotherapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus: nine Japanese institutions trial
Case series	Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and feasibility of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Patients and methods: Fifty-four patients with clinically T4 and/or M1 lymph node (LYM) squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were enrolled.
Case series	Patients received protracted infusion of fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2)/24 hours on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12, 2-hour infusion of cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, and concurrent radiation therapy at a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks.
Case series	Filgrastim was prophylactically administered to 35 patients.
Case series	This schedule was repeated twice every 5 weeks, for a total radiation dose of 60 Gy, followed by two courses of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 5 days) and cisplatin (80 mg/m(2) on day 1).
Case series	Results: There were 21 patients with T4M0 disease, one with T2M1 LYM, 17 with T3M1 LYM, and 15 withT4M1 LYM. Forty-nine patients (91%) completed at least the chemoradiotherapy segment.
Case series	The 18 patients (33%) who achieved a complete response included nine (25%) of the 36 with T4 disease and nine (50%) of the 18 with non-T4 disease. Major toxicities were leukocytopenia and esophagitis; there were four (7%) treatment-related deaths.
Case series	Prophylactic filgrastim reduced the incidence of grade 3 or worse leukopenia without improving dose-intensity or response. With a median follow-up duration of 43 months, median survival time was 9 months. The 3-year survival rate was 23%.
Case series	Conclusion: Despite its significant toxicity, this combined modality seemed to have curative potential even in cases of locally advanced carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Definitive chemoradiotherapy for T4 and/or M1 lymph node squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Combined chemoradiotherapy with and without surgery are widely accepted alternatives for the curative treatment of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm B).
randomized controlled trial	Primary outcome was overall survival time. Results: The median observation time was 6 years.
randomized controlled trial	The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P <. 05).
randomized controlled trial	Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64. 3%; 95% CI, 52. 1% to 76. 5%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40. 7%; 95% CI, 28. 9% to 52.
randomized controlled trial	5%; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2. 1; 95% CI, 1. 3 to 3. 5; P =. 003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12. 8% v 3. 5%, respectively; P =. 03).
randomized controlled trial	Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0. 30; 95% CI, 0. 19 to 0. 47; P <. 0001).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC.
randomized controlled trial	Tumor response to induction chemotherapy identifies a favorable prognostic group within these high-risk patients, regardless of the treatment group.
randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiation with and without surgery in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To analyze the effect of radiation dose escalation to the primary tumor on local tumor control in definitive chemoradiation (dCRT) for patients with esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with medically inoperable and/or irresectable esophageal carcinoma, referred for dCRT, were randomly assigned between a standard dose (SD) of 50. 4 Gy/1. 8 Gy for 5.
randomized controlled trial	5 weeks to the tumor and regional lymph nodes and a high dose (HD) up to a total dose of 61. 6 Gy to the primary tumor.
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy consisted of courses of concurrent carboplatin (area under the curve 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) in both arms once a week for 6 weeks. The primary end point was local progression-free survival.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Between September 2012 and June 2018, 260 patients were included. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was present in 61% of patients, and 39% had adenocarcinoma (AC).
randomized controlled trial	Radiation treatment was completed by 94%, and 85% had at least five courses of chemotherapy. The median follow-up time for all patients was 50 months.
randomized controlled trial	The 3-year local progression-free survival (LPFS) was 70% in the SD arm versus 73% in the HD arm (not significant). The LPFS for SCC and AC was 75% versus 79% and 61% versus 61% for SD and HD, respectively (not significant).
randomized controlled trial	The 3-year locoregional progression-free survival was 52% and 59% for the SD and HD arms, respectively (P =. 08). Overall, grade 4 and 5 common toxicity criteria were 12% and 5% in the SD arm versus 14% and 10% in the HD arm, respectively (P =. 15).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: In dCRT for esophageal cancer, radiation dose escalation up to 61. 6 Gy to the primary tumor did not result in a significant increase in local control over 50. 4 Gy. The absence of a dose effect was observed in both AC and SCC.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized Study on Dose Escalation in Definitive Chemoradiation for Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer (ARTDECO Study)
Non-randomized controlled trial	Fifty untreated cases of squamous cell carcinoma arising from the middle one-third of the esophagus, with no apparent extraesophageal spread on a computed tomography (CT) scan and with a Karnofsky performance status of over 70, were treated by external beam irradiation to a dose of 3500 cGy/15 fractions/3 weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Twenty-five patients (Group A) received treatment with further external beam irradiation to a dose of 2000 cGy/10 fractions/2 weeks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Another group of 25 patients (Group B) received treatment with high dose rate intracavitary irradiation to a dose of 1200 cGy delivered in two sessions of 600 cGy each a week apart.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All patients were assessed symptomatically, endoscopically, and radiologically every 3 months. There was marked difference at the end of 1 year in relief of dysphagia (37. 5% in Group A vs. 70. 6% in Group B), local control (25% in group A vs. 70.
Non-randomized controlled trial	6% in group B) although the results were statistically insignificant (p greater than 0. 05) and actuarial survival (44% in group A vs. 78% in group B) which was, however, significant statistically (z = 2. 83).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The cumulative radiation effect (CRE) by external beam irradiation was 1729 reu and by external beam and intracavitary irradiation 1741 reu, but the biological dose effect was better with external beam and intracavitary irradiation.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Eight percent of patients treated by external beam and intracavitary irradiation had strictures in contrast to 4% treated by external beam irradiation alone.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Moderate doses of external beam and intracavitary irradiation can give a better local response than external beam irradiation alone for the same biological dose in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Radiation therapy of esophageal cancer: role of high dose rate brachytherapy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CT) is the standard treatment for non resectable esophageal cancer. Usual total radiation dose is 50 Gy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In order to enhance local control rate a Phase II study was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of a combined treatment with an external radiation dose of 60 Gy and three cycles of concomitant CT, using the three main active drugs (CDDP, 5 FU and MMC), followed by a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy delivering 10 Gy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods and materials: Fifty-three patients, 48 men and 5 women, were entered in this study. Stages were evaluated with CT scan and with endoscopic sonography. Fifteen were Stage IIB, 38 Stage III.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Treatment consisted of conventional fractionated RT to a total dose of 60 Gy delivered with 2 Gy per fraction, one fraction per day and five fractions per week.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The CT regimen was a combination of Cisplatinum (CDDP) 20 mg/m2 and 5 Fluorouracil (5FU) 600 mg/m2 continuous infusion, from days 1-4 Mitomycin C (MMC) was given at 6 mg/m2 on day 1. Three cycles were administered on days 1, 22, and 43.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Brachytherapy was delivered one week after the end of external radiation therapy. Results: Full radiation therapy dose was delivered for 94% of the patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	CT compliance, evaluated on the mean relative dose-intensity was 85% for CDDP, 81% for 5FU and 51% for MMC. Overall grade 3 and 4 WHO toxicity rates were 23% and 7%, respectively. Haematologic toxicity was the most limiting factor.
Non-randomized controlled trial	One patient died from treatment toxicity. Local control rate at one year was 74%. Three-year actuarial survival rate was 27%. Distant metastasis was the main cause of treatment failure. Swallowing score was good for 75% of the patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Stage, performance status and weight loss were prognostic factors.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: This regimen with high dose RT, HDR brachytherapy and concomitant CT is feasible; however, a high level of haematologic toxicity was observed with the CDDP, 5FU and MMC regimen.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Despite a poor compliance with CT, treatment results are very encouraging for patients with locally advanced disease.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Radiotherapy with high dose rate brachytherapy boost and concomitant chemotherapy for Stages IIB and III esophageal carcinoma: results of a pilot study
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Since carcinoma of the esophagus is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, many cases of esophageal cancer are beyond possible radical resection and only palliative treatment can be performed in such cases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Therefore, a great deal of discussion has taken place concerning indications for treatment modality, and various procedures have been performed to palliate such patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The prognosis for such patients is still poor, even though many kinds of palliation have already been developed and applied.
Non-randomized controlled trial	To improve the prognosis of such patients we developed a multidisciplinary treatment which includes high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy (HDR-ILBRT) and evaluated its effectiveness, especially the HDR-ILBRT component.
Non-randomized controlled trial	PATIENTS AND TREATMENT METHODS: Sixty-six patients with unresectable esophageal cancer enrolled in this study. Twenty-seven patients underwent bypass operations.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Seven of the 27 patients received external irradiation only (group BE), 11 received external irradiation and HDR-ILBRT (group BEH), while the remaining 9 did not receive radiotherapy (group B).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Another 39 patients without bypass operations were all treated with radiotherapy, 22 with external irradiation only (group E) and 17 were treated with external irradiation and HDR-ILBRT (group EH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	After completion of radiotherapy, all patients received chemotherapy with 5-FU (2,500 mg/body) and CDDP (100 mg/body). Results: Mean survival time and the 5-year survival rate of group BEH (13. 3 +/- 1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5 months and 20%) were significantly improved compared with group BE + B (p < 0. 05). In the patients without bypass operations, there were significant differences in the mean survival time and the 3-year survival rate in groups EH and E (group EH 16.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5 +/- 2. 5 months, 21. 8%, group E 9. 0 +/- 1. 3 months, 0%, p < 0. 05). The bypass operation itself and chemotherapy did not significantly affect the prognosis of patients with unresectable esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: These results strongly suggest the use of HDR-ILBRT, as a component of multidisciplinary treatment for unresectable esophageal cancer, was significantly effective and HDR-ILBRT contributed to improve outcomes in patients with advanced esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HDR-ILBRT should be established as a component of treatments for unresectable esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Effect of multidisciplinary treatment with high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy on survival in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	This study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil combination in patients with unresectable locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Treatment consisted of docetaxel 60 mg m(-2), cisplatin 75 mg m(-2) on day 1 and fluorouracil 750 mg m(-2) day(-1) on days 2-5, repeated every 3 weeks for three cycles, followed by carboplatin 100 mg m(-2) week(-1) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions, 5 days week(-1)).
Non-randomized controlled trial	After radiotherapy, eligible patients either underwent an oesophagectomy or received high dose rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDR-EBT). Thirty-one out of 37 enrolled patients completed the planned chemotherapy and 30 completed chemoradiation.
Non-randomized controlled trial	After completion of chemotherapy, 49% (95% CI: 32. 2-66. 2) had a clinical response. Twelve patients (32%) underwent a resection, which was radical in 60% (postoperative mortality: 0%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	A pathological complete response was documented in four patients (11% of enrolled, 30% of resected). The median survival was 10. 8 months (95% CI: 8. 1-12. 4), and the 1- and 2-year survival rates were 35. 1 and 18. 9%, respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropoenia 32%, anaemia 11%, non-neutropoenic infections 18%, diarrhoea 6% and oesophagitis 5%. Nine patients (24%) developed a tracheo-oesophageal fistula during treatment.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Even if the addition of docetaxel to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) seems to be more active than the cisplatin and 5-FU combination, an incremental improvement in survival is not seen, and the toxicity observed in this study population is of concern.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In order to improve the prognosis of these patients, new drugs, combinations and strategies with a better therapeutic index need to be identified.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II trial of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by carboplatin and radiotherapy in locally advanced oesophageal cancer
Cohort study	Background and aim: The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy and limitations of radiation therapy (RT) for superficial esophageal carcinoma, and to explore the indications for more aggressive therapy, such as combined chemo-radiotherapy.
Cohort study	Methods: Sixty-eight patients with stage I (UICC T1N0M0) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by definitive RT alone were analyzed.
Cohort study	Brachytherapy was administered in 36 patients as a boost, and the prescribed doses were 10 Gy (5 Gy x 2 times) at a low dose rate (19 patients) and 9 Gy (3 Gy x 3 times) at a high dose rate (17 patients).
Cohort study	Recurrence patterns and survival rates were assessed and the factors predisposing to recurrences after RT were statistically investigated by univariate analysis.
Cohort study	Results: The 5-year cause-specific survival rate and the locoregional control rate were 79. 9% and 82. 1%, respectively. No case of recurrence or disease-related death was observed in any of the patients with mucosal cancer.
Cohort study	Among the cases with the cancer invading the submucosa, there were 12 cases with locoregional recurrence and two cases with distant metastases.
Cohort study	In cases of submucosal esophageal cancer, the tumor length was the only statistically significant factor predicting locoregional control. The 5-year locoregional control rate in cases with a short length of the tumor (<or=5 cm) was 83.
Cohort study	3%, whereas the corresponding rate in cases with the tumor measuring >5 cm in length was 57. 8% (P = 0. 036).
Cohort study	Patients treated by additional brachytherapy exhibited better cause-specific survival and locoregional control rates than those receiving external RT alone, however, the addition had no statistically significant influence on the outcome.
Cohort study	Conclusions: RT was a successful treatment for stage I esophageal cancer, and the treatment outcome using RT was nearly comparable to that of surgery.
Cohort study	However, it is suggested that chemo-radiation should be considered in inoperable cases of submucosal cancer when the tumor is more than 5 cm in length.
Cohort study	Radiation therapy alone for stage I (UICC T1N0M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: indications for surgery or combined chemoradiotherapy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective study was designed to determine the feasibility and tolerance of external beam irradiation plus concurrent chemotherapy and esophageal brachytherapy (EB) in a potentially curable group of patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods and materials: Planned treatment was 50 Gy external beam radiation (25 fractions/5 weeks) followed 2 weeks later by EB [either high dose rate (HDR) 5 Gy, weeks 8, 9, and 10, for a total of 15 Gy, or low dose rate (LDR) 20 Gy, week 8].
Non-randomized controlled trial	The protocol was later revised to delete the LDR alternative, owing to poor accrual, and to decrease the HDR dose to 10 Gy (i. e. 5 Gy, weeks 8 and 9).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy was given weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg2/m per 24 h, 96-h infusion. The study closed in January 1995 after 56 patients had been entered on the HDR arm.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Six patients were declared ineligible owing to tumor extension to the gastroesophageal junction (three patients) or involved celiac lymph nodes (three patients).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Of the 50 eligible patients, the planned EB dose was 15 and 10 Gy in 40 and 10 patients, respectively. Forty-six (92%) of the eligible patients had squamous histology, and three (6%) adenocarcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Life-threatening toxicity or treatment-related death occurred in 13 (26%) and 4 (8%) of the 50 eligible patients, respectively. Treatment-related esophageal fistulas occurred in three patients (12% overall, 14% of patients starting EB) at 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5-6. 2 months from the first day of brachytherapy, leading to death in three. The fourth death was secondary to renal toxicity and infection attributed to chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	No correlation was found between the development of fistula and location of primary tumor, brachytherapy active length or applicator diameter. So far, 5 of the 6 treatment-related fistulas have occurred following 15 Gy EB.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The other fistula occurred after only 5 Gy of a planned 15 Gy was delivered. Conclusion: Thirty-five patients (70%) were able to complete external beam, EB, and at least two courses of chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Estimated survival rate at 12 months is 48%, with an estimated 11-month median survival rate.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Survival following external beam radiation plus concurrent chemotherapy and EB does not appear to be significantly different from survival seen following external beam radiation and chemotherapy only.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The development of six fistulas in the 35 patients completing EB is of concern. Based on the high incidence of fistulas, we urge extreme caution in employing EB as a boost following concurrent external beam radiation and chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A phase I/II study of external beam radiation, brachytherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in localized cancer of the esophagus (RTOG 92-07): preliminary toxicity report
review	Introduction: There is wide variation in the indications, treatment regimens, and dosimetry for brachytherapy in the treatment of cancer of the esophagus. No guidelines for optimal therapy currently exist.
review	Methods and materials: Utilizing published reports and clinical experience, representatives of the Clinical Research Committee of the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) formulated guidelines for brachytherapy in esophageal cancer.
review	Results: Recommendations were made for brachytherapy in the definitive and palliative treatment of esophageal cancer.
review	(A) Definitive treatment: Good candidates for brachytherapy include patients with unifocal thoracic adeno- or squamous cancers < or = 10 cm in length, with no evidence of intra-abdominal or metastatic disease.
review	Contraindications include tracheal or bronchial involvement, cervical esophagus location, or stenosis that cannot be bypassed. The esophageal brachytherapy applicator should have an external diameter of 6-10 mm.
review	If 5FU-based chemotherapy and 45-50-Gy external beam are used, recommended brachytherapy is either: (i) HDR 10 Gy in two weekly fractions of 5 Gy each; or (ii) LDR 20 Gy in a single course at 0. 4-1 Gy/hr.
review	All doses are specified 1 cm from the midsource or mid-dwell position. Brachytherapy should follow external beam radiation therapy and should not be given concurrently with chemotherapy.
review	(B) Palliative treatment: Patients with adeno- or squamous cancers of the thoracic esophagus with distant metastases or unresectable local disease progression/recurrence after definitive radiation treatment should be considered for brachytherapy with palliative intent.
review	After limited dose (30 Gy) EBRT, the recommended brachytherapy is either: (i) HDR 10-14 Gy in one or two fractions; or (ii) LDR 20-25 Gy in a single course at 0. 4-1 Gy/hr.
review	The need for external beam radiation in newly diagnosed patients with a life expectancy of less than 3 months is controversial. In these cases, HDR of 15-20 Gy in two to four fractions or LDR of 25-40 Gy at 0. 4-1 Gy/hr may be of benefit.
review	Conclusion: ABS guidelines for esophageal brachytherapy now exist and will be updated by the ABS in the future, as clinical data using more uniform treatment techniques becomes available.
review	American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) consensus guidelines for brachytherapy of esophageal cancer. Clinical Research Committee, American Brachytherapy Society, Philadelphia, PA
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: A phase II trial of accelerated fractionation radiation with concurrent cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy was performed to investigate the role of the paclitaxel, when substituted for fluorouracil (5-FU), in the chemoradiotherapy of esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with an esophageal ultrasound stage of T(3) or N(1) or M(1) (nodal) esophageal cancer were treated with two courses of a cisplatin infusion (20 mg/m(2)/d for 4 days) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) over 24 hours) concurrent with a split course of accelerated fractionation radiation (1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5 Gy bid to a total dose of 45 Gy). Surgical resection was performed 4 to 6 weeks later followed by a single identical postoperative course of chemoradiotherapy (24 Gy) in patients with significant residual tumor at surgery.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Toxicity and results of this treatment were retrospectively compared with our previous 5-FU and cisplatin chemoradiotherapy experience. Results: Between September 1995 and July 1997, 40 patients were entered onto this study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although dysphagia proved worse in our 5-FU-treated patients, profound leukopenia and a need for unplanned hospitalization were significantly more common in the paclitaxel group. Thirty-seven patients (93%) proved resectable for cure.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The 3-year projected overall survival is 30%, locoregional control is 81%, and distant metastatic disease control is 44%. When compared with a similarly staged cohort of 5-FU-treated patients, there was no advantage for any survival function studied.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: This paclitaxel-based treatment regimen for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer produced increased toxicity with no improvement in results when compared with our previous 5-FU experience.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Paclitaxel-based treatments must be carefully and prospectively studied before their incorporation into the standard management of esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Does paclitaxel improve the chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer? A nonrandomized comparison with fluorouracil-based therapy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Preoperative paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy may improve the response rates and survival in patients with localized esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We evaluated paclitaxel-based induction chemoradiotherapy in patients with localized esophageal cancer to determine its feasibility, clinical response, pathologic response, and overall survival.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods and materials: Between 1995 and 1998, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. At study entry, patients were categorized as either resectable or unresectable according to evaluation by an experienced thoracic surgeon.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All patients were treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, 29 with radiotherapy to 3,000 cGy in 15 fractions. Resectable patients underwent esophagectomy 4 weeks later.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Postoperatively, patients received two cycles of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 and leucovorin 300 mg on Days 1-3, given every 28 days.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients who were deemed unsuitable for resection from the outset continued radiotherapy to a total dose of 6,000 cGy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 50 patients, all began neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 40 patients underwent surgery, and 25 patients completed postoperative chemotherapy. A pathologic complete response was seen in 7 patients (17. 5%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with a pathologic response had a median survival of 32. 4 months vs. 14. 4 months for nonresponders (p < 0. 001). Patients with a clinical response had a median survival of 25. 2 months compared with 15. 6 months for nonresponders (p = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	002). At a median follow up of 19. 8 months (range 2. 4-100. 8), the median survival was 20. 4 months and the 3-year overall survival rate was 23. 2%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Although preoperative cisplatin/paclitaxel with 3,000 cGy was tolerable, this multimodality regimen did not appear to be superior to standard cisplatin/5-fluorouracil-containing regimens and its use is not recommended.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II study of preoperative paclitaxel/cisplatin with radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity and safety of oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil-based chemo-radiotherapy in patients with not radically resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Fifty-nine patients with adeno or squamous-cell carcinoma received oxaliplatin (60 mg/m(2)), and leucovorin (20 mg/m(2) on days 1,8,15,29,36,43,50,57) followed by continuous infusion fluorouracil (200 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-22 and 29-64) with radiotherapy (1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	8 Gy daily fractions to a total dose of 45 Gy, from days 29 to 64). When feasible, surgery was scheduled 6-8 weeks after chemo-radiotherapy completion. The primary endpoint was 1-year progression-free survival.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Forty (68%) patients completed treatment without modifications. An objective clinical response was seen in 35 patients (59%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Esophagectomy was possible in 33 patients and a complete resection (R0) was achieved in 26 (79%) with 6 pathologic complete responses (pCR) and 3 near pCR. At a median follow-up of 39.
Non-randomized controlled trial	7 months for the surviving patients, the median progression-free and overall survivals were 11 months (95% CI 6. 5-14) and 18. 5 months (95% CI 13-29). The 1-year progression-free and overall survivals were 47. 5% (95% CI 34-59.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5%) and 63% (95% CI 49-74%). Major toxicities were esophagitis (20% G3 and 5% G4) and diarrhea (8. 5% G3 and 8. 5% G4). Hematological toxicity (7% G3 and 3% G4) was less common; severe neurotoxicity (3% G3) was infrequent.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Concurrent oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy followed or not by esophagectomy has a tolerable toxicity and promising activity in locally advanced esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Multi-center phase II trial of chemo-radiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin in locally advanced esophageal cancer
Cohort study	Objective: To compare toxicities, disease control, and survival outcomes for patients treated with either cisplatin/irinotecan versus carboplatin/paclitaxel concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Methods: Single-institution retrospective comparison between treatment groups: the cisplatin/irinotecan group was treated with 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy, whereas the carboplatin/paclitaxel group began with chemoradiotherapy followed by 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy.
Cohort study	Acute toxicities, response rates, disease control, survival outcomes, and patterns of failure were compared between the groups.
Cohort study	Results: Between January 2000 and December 2007, 57 patients were identified for inclusion in the present study (38 cisplatin/irinotecan and 19 carboplatin/paclitaxel).
Cohort study	Groups were well-balanced by clinical-, pathologic-, staging-, and treatment-related factors.
Cohort study	Thirty-five patients (92%) in the cisplatin/irinotecan group and 18 patients (95%) in the carboplatin/paclitaxel group completed the concurrent phase of chemoradiotherapy.
Cohort study	There were no significant differences in hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities between the groups. At a median survivor follow-up of 37. 6 months (range: 7. 3-59.
Cohort study	3 months) for the entire population, 22 patients were alive (16 without evidence of disease). The 3-year overall survival estimates was 19. 7% for the cisplatin/irinotecan group versus 56. 1% for the carboplatin/paclitaxel group (P = 0. 022).
Cohort study	Estimated 3-year cancer-specific survivals were 24. 6% for the cisplatin/irinotecan group versus 59. 3% for the carboplatin/paclitaxel group (P = 0. 033).
Cohort study	Conclusion: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel is well-tolerated and provided superior overall and disease-specific survival compared with cisplatin/irinotecan chemoradiotherapy in the present study population.
Cohort study	Further investigation is warranted.
Cohort study	Cisplatin/Irinotecan versus carboplatin/paclitaxel as definitive chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	This randomized clinical study was to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of two chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil + radiotherapy and cisplatin + docetaxel + radiotherapy) regimens in patients with unresectable local advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Previously untreated patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma were randomly assigned into two groups (each had 45 patients): cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil + radiotherapy (PF) group and cisplatin + docetaxel + radiotherapy (DP) group.
randomized controlled trial	All patients received radiotherapy of 50. 4 Gy (28 fractions of 1. 8 Gy) over 5 weeks (5 fractions a week).
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy for PF group comprises 5-fluorouracil at days 1-4 (250 mg/m(2)/day) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) at day 1 of every 28-day cycle; full treatment course included 4 cycles.
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy for DP group comprises docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) at day 1 of every 28-day cycle; full treatment course included 4 cycles. Response, survival, progression and toxicity of both regimens were studied.
randomized controlled trial	Overall response rate (ORR) was 53. 3 % for PF group and 73. 3 % for DP group. Median overall survival (OS) time was 22. 3 months for PF group and 43.
randomized controlled trial	2 group months for DP: Patients of DP group had a significant longer overall median survival time (P < 0. 05).
randomized controlled trial	Toxicity was acceptable; patients of PF group and patients of DP group did not showed significant difference in serious haematological event incidence (24. 4 vs. 35. 6 %, P > 0. 05).
randomized controlled trial	ORR and OS favour DP over PF in the treatment of patients with unresectable local advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel and cisplatin concurrent with radiotherapy versus 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin concurrent with radiotherapy in treatment for locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a randomized clinical study
randomized controlled trial	Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for localised oesophageal cancer (EC), but improvement is still needed.
randomized controlled trial	A randomised phase II trial was initiated to assess the feasibility and efficacy in terms of the endoscopic complete response rate (ECRR) of radiotherapy with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil (FOLFOX4) or cisplatin/fluorouracil.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients with unresectable EC (any T, any N, M0 or M1a), or medically unfit for surgery, were randomly assigned to receive either six cycles (three concomitant and three post-radiotherapy) of FOLFOX4 (arm A) or four cycles (two concomitant and two post-radiotherapy) of cisplatin/fluorouracil (arm B) along with radiotherapy 50 Gy in both arms.
randomized controlled trial	Responses were reviewed by independent experts. Results: A total of 97 patients were randomised (arm A/B, 53/44) and 95 were assessable. The majority had squamous cell carcinoma (82%; arm A/B, 42/38). Chemoradiotherapy was completed in 74 and 66%.
randomized controlled trial	The ECRR was 45 and 29% in arms A and B, respectively. Median times to progression were 15. 2 and 9. 2 months and the median overall survival was 22. 7 and 15. 1 months in arms A and B, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Chemoradiotherapy with FOLFOX4, a well-tolerated and convenient combination with promising efficacy, is now being tested in a phase III trial.
randomized controlled trial	Phase II randomised trial of chemoradiotherapy with FOLFOX4 or cisplatin plus fluorouracil in oesophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Introduction: The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, clinically unresectable esophageal cancer receiving cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Eligible patients (cT4 M0 or medically unresectable, biopsy proven, and noncervical esophageal cancer) were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m (day 1, cycle 1), cetuximab 250 mg/m (day 8, 15, cycle 1; then days 1, 8, and 15 for subsequent cycles), cisplatin 30 mg/m (days 1 and 8, all cycles), and irinotecan 65 mg/m (days 1 and 8, all cycles).
Non-randomized controlled trial	TRT was administered at 1. 8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50. 4 Gy, to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3. The primary endpoint was 2-year OS, with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: The study was closed because of slow accrual, with 21 eligible patients (11 squamous, 10 adenocarcinoma) enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007. Two-year OS and PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 33. 3% (14. 6-57. 0%) and 23. 8% (8.
Non-randomized controlled trial	2-47. 2%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median (95% CI) OS and PFS were 11. 2 (6. 4-43. 6) and 6. 4 (3. 7-12. 0) months, respectively. The overall response rate (95% CI) among 17 evaluable patients was 17. 6% (3. 8-43.
Non-randomized controlled trial	4%), including 6% confirmed complete responders and 12% unconfirmed partial responders. Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment (sudden death and gastrointestinal necrosis). Ten (47. 6%) and 6 (28.
Non-randomized controlled trial	6%) patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity, respectively: 52. 4% were hematologic, 23. 8% had fatigue, 19. 0% had nausea, 19. 0% had dehydration, and 19. 0% had anorexia.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Concomitant cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced esophageal cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Single-institution phase-II cetuximab-based combined modality trials have yielded encouraging results in preliminary analyses.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The SWOG GI Committee endorses enrollment to open clinical trials to clarify the therapeutic ratio of cetuximab-based combined modality approaches for esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Cetuximab plus cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy as definitive treatment for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer: a phase-II study of the SWOG (S0414)
randomized controlled trial	Background: Definitive chemoradiotherapy is a curative treatment option for oesophageal carcinoma, especially in patients unsuitable for surgery.
randomized controlled trial	The PRODIGE5/ACCORD17 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FOLFOX treatment regimen (fluorouracil plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin) versus fluorouracil and cisplatin as part of chemoradiotherapy in patients with localised oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 2/3 trial of patients aged 18 years or older enrolled from 24 centres in France between Oct 15, 2004, and Aug 25, 2011.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible participants had confirmed stage I-IVA oesophageal carcinoma (adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell, or adenosquamous), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0-2, sufficient caloric intake, adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function, and had been selected to receive definitive chemoradiotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either six cycles (three concomitant to radiotherapy) of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2), and infusional fluorouracil 1600 mg/m(2) (FOLFOX) over 46 h, or four cycles (two concomitant to radiotherapy) of fluorouracil 1000 mg/m(2) per day for 4 days and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1.
randomized controlled trial	Both groups also received 50 Gy radiotherapy in 25 fractions (five fractions per week).
randomized controlled trial	Random allocation to treatment groups was done by a central computerised randomisation procedure by minimisation, stratified by centre, histology, weight loss, and ECOG status, and was achieved independently from the study investigators.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Data analysis was primarily done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00861094.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 134 participants were randomly allocated to the FOLFOX group and 133 to the fluorouracil and cisplatin group (intention-to-treat population), and 131 patients in the FOLFOX group and 128 in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group actually received the study drugs (safety population).
randomized controlled trial	Median follow-up was 25·3 months (IQR 15·9-36·4). Median progression-free survival was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·1-14·5) in the FOLFOX group and 9·4 months (8·1-10·6) in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group (HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·70-1·24; p=0·64).
randomized controlled trial	One toxic death occurred in the FOLFOX group and six in the fluorouracil-cisplatin group (p=0·066). No significant differences were recorded in the rates of most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events between the treatment groups.
randomized controlled trial	Of all-grade adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of patients, paraesthesia (61 [47%] events in 131 patients in the FOLFOX group vs three [2%] in 128 patients in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group, p<0·0001), sensory neuropathy (24 [18%] vs one [1%], p<0·0001), increases in aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (14 [11%] vs two [2%], p=0·002), and increases in alanine aminotransferase concentrations (11 [8%] vs two [2%], p=0·012) were more common in the FOLFOX group, whereas serum creatinine increases (four [3%] vs 15 [12%], p=0·007), mucositis (35 [27%] vs 41 [32%], p=0·011), and alopecia (two [2%] vs 12 [9%], p=0·005) were more common in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Although chemoradiotherapy with FOLFOX did not increase progression-free survival compared with chemoradiotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin, FOLFOX might be a more convenient option for patients with localised oesophageal cancer unsuitable for surgery.

randomized controlled trial	Definitive chemoradiotherapy with FOLFOX versus fluorouracil and cisplatin in patients with oesophageal cancer (PRODIGE5/ACCORD17): final results of a randomised, phase 2/3 trial
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To identify a dose and schedule of oxaliplatin (OXP) to be safely administered in combination with protracted-infusion (PI) fluorouracil (5-FU) and external-beam radiation therapy (XRT) for patients with primary esophageal carcinoma (EC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligibility included therapeutically naïve EC patients with clinical disease stages II, III, or IV.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Initial doses and schedules for cycle 1 consisted of OXP 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; PI 5-FU 180 mg/m(2) for 24 hours for 35 days; and XRT 1. 8 Gy in 28 fractions starting on day 8.
Non-randomized controlled trial	At completion of cycle 1, eligible patients could undergo an operation or begin cycle 2 without XRT. Postoperative patients were eligible for cycle 2. Stage IV patients were allowed three cycles in the absence of disease progression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	OXP and 5-FU increases were based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) encountered in cohorts of three consecutive patients. Results: Thirty-eight eligible patients received therapy: 22 noninvasively staged as IV and 16 noninvasively staged as II and III.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thirty-six patients completed cycle 1, 29 patients started cycle 2, and 24 patients completed cycle 2. The combined-modality therapy was well tolerated, but DLT prevented OXP and 5-FU escalation. No grade 4 hematologic toxicity was noted.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Eleven grade 3 and two grade 4 clinical toxicities were noted in eight patients. After cycle 1, 29 patients (81%) had no cancer in the esophageal mucosa.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thirteen patients underwent an operation with intent to resect the esophagus; five patients (38%) exhibited pathologic complete responses.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: OXP 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29 administered with PI 5-FU and XRT is safe, tolerable, and seems effective against primary EC. The role of OXP in multimodality regimens against EC deserves further evaluation.

randomized controlled trial	Importance: The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition in chemoradiation strategies in the nonoperative treatment of patients with esophageal cancer remains uncertain.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the benefit of cetuximab added to concurrent chemoradiation therapy for patients undergoing nonoperative treatment of esophageal carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: A National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored, multicenter, phase 3, randomized clinical trial open to patients with biopsy-proven carcinoma of the esophagus. The study accrued 344 patients from 2008 to 2013.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Patients were randomized to weekly concurrent cisplatin (50 mg/m2), paclitaxel (25 mg/m2), and daily radiation of 50. 4 Gy/1. 8 Gy fractions with or without weekly cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on day 1 then 250 mg/m2 weekly).
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint, with a study designed to detect an increase in 2-year OS from 41% to 53%; 80% power and 1-sided α =. 025.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Between June 30, 2008, and February 8, 2013, 344 patients were enrolled. This analysis used all data received at NRG Oncology through April 12, 2015.
randomized controlled trial	Sixteen patients were ineligible, resulting in 328 evaluable patients, 159 in the experimental arm and 169 in the control arm.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were well matched between the treatment arms for patient and tumor characteristics: 263 (80%) with T3 or T4 disease, 215 (66%) N1, and 62 (19%) with celiac nodal involvement.
randomized controlled trial	Incidence of grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events at any time was 71 (46%), 35 (23%), or 6 (4%) in the experimental arm and 83 (50%), 28 (17%), or 2 (1%) in the control arm, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	A clinical complete response (cCR) rate of 81 (56%) was observed in the experimental arm vs 92 (58%) in the control arm (Fisher exact test, P =. 66).
randomized controlled trial	No differences were seen in cCR between treatment arms for either histology (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell). Median follow-up for all patients was 18. 6 months.
randomized controlled trial	The 24- and 36-month local failure for the experimental arm was 47% (95% CI, 38%-57%) and 49% (95% CI, 40%-59%) vs 49% (95% CI, 41%-58%) and 49% (95% CI, 41%-58%) for the control arm (HR, 0. 92; 95% CI, 0. 66-1. 28; P =. 65).
randomized controlled trial	The 24- and 36-month OS rates for the experimental arm were 45% (95% CI, 37%-53%) and 34% (95% CI, 26%-41%) vs 44% (95% CI, 36%-51%) and 28% (95% CI, 21%-35%) for the control arm (HR, 0. 90; 95% CI, 0. 70-1. 16; P =. 47).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions and relevance: The addition of cetuximab to concurrent chemoradiation did not improve OS.
randomized controlled trial	These phase 3 trial results point to little benefit to current EGFR-targeted agents in an unselected patient population, and highlight the need for predictive biomarkers in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.

randomized controlled trial	Effect of the Addition of Cetuximab to Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, and Radiation Therapy for Patients With Esophageal Cancer: The NRG Oncology RTOG 0436 Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Perioperative chemotherapy significantly improves survival in patients with locally advanced oesophagogastric cancer (EGC).
randomized controlled trial	However, as approximately 60% of patients will die from their disease, new therapeutic agents such as molecular-targeted drugs are needed.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: To evaluate the role of panitumumab with perioperative chemotherapy, previously untreated patients with locally advanced EGC received, in an open-label randomised phase II study (NEOPECX), standard epirubicin, cisplatin, capecitabine (ECX) chemotherapy with or without panitumumab.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end-point was the histological response rate after neoadjuvant therapy. The expression status and gene copy number of EGFR, HER2, and MET were determined by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
randomized controlled trial	Plasma samples were collected before the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Overall, 160 patients (80 versus 80) were eligible. The majority (82% versus 80%) showed lymph node involvement.
randomized controlled trial	Rate of R0-resection, percentage of patients with downstaging to ypT0-2 at pathohistological evaluation, and rate of major histological response was equal in both arms.
randomized controlled trial	Toxicity was increased by panitumumab with regard to thromboembolic events and skin toxicity. Patients with tumour EGFR, HER2 or MET expression had shorter progression-free and overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	FISH positivity for these markers was associated with shorter survival independent of therapy. High levels of soluble EGFR in particular predicted poor survival in the panitumumab arm.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The addition of panitumumab to ECX did not improve downstaging of locally advanced EGC. Low plasma levels of pathway-associated proteins such as sEGFR may identify a group of patients that benefit from EGFR-directed therapy.

randomized controlled trial	Perioperative chemotherapy with or without epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in unselected patients with locally advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma: Randomized phase II study with advanced biomarker program of the German Cancer Society (AIO/CAO STO-0801)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Two nonoperative approaches (one without fluorouracil) using induction chemotherapy and then definitive chemoradiotherapy developed at two centers were compared in patients with localized esophageal cancer (LEC).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was to assess whether any approach would achieve a >or= 77. 5% 1-year survival rate, surpassing the historical 66% rate from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 9405.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In a multi-institutional cooperative group setting, patients with LEC who had unresectable cancer, were unwilling to undergo surgery, or were medically unfit for surgery were randomly assigned to receive either induction with fluorouracil, cisplatin, and paclitaxel and then fluorouracil plus paclitaxel with 50.
randomized controlled trial	4 Gy of radiation (arm A) or induction with paclitaxel plus cisplatin and then the same chemotherapy with 50. 4 Gy of radiation (arm B). Safety and survival rates were assessed.
randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 84 patients were randomly assigned (arm A, n = 41; arm B, n = 43), and 72 were assessable (arm A, n = 37; arm B, n = 35). The median survival time was 28. 7 months for patients in arm A and 14. 9 months for patients in arm B (18.
randomized controlled trial	8 months for patients in RTOG 9405). The 1-year survival rate of 75. 7% in arm A was close to, but did not meet or surpass, the 77. 5% goal. The 2-year survival rate was 56% for arm A and 37% for arm B.
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 (arm A = 54%, arm B = 43%) and grade 4 toxicities (arm A = 27%, arm B = 40%) were frequent. Treatment-related death occurred in 3% of patients in arm A and 6% of patients in arm B.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Both arms of RTOG 0113 were associated with high morbidity, and the study did not meet its 1-year survival end point.

Case series	Aims: To evaluate a single unit's experience with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for treating locally advanced non-metastatic initially resectable and unresectable oesophago-gastric cancer.
Case series	Methods: The medical records of all patients with either locally advanced carcinoma of the lower oesophagus or cardia treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy between August 1999 and January 2003 were reviewed.
Case series	Results: Sixty-four patients with initially resectable tumours (T2-3 or N+) and 38 patients with initially unresectable tumours (T4 or M1a) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (83% combination Epirubicin, Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil).
Case series	Symptomatic grade III/IV toxicity was observed in 33% of patients. Chemotherapy was not completed in 20 patients because of death (5. 9%) and inadequate tumour response/toxicity (13. 7%). Forty-three patients (67.
Case series	3%) with initially resectable tumours and 19 patients (50%) with initially unresectable tumours underwent surgery. Conclusions: Chemotherapy in this study was associated with appreciable toxicity.
Case series	Patients with initially unresectable locally advanced disease can be downstaged with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Case series	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced carcinoma of the lower oesophagus and oesophago-gastric junction
Case series	Background: Patients with esophageal cancer that invades adjacent structures (cT4b) are precluded from surgery and usually treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT).
Case series	dCRT might result in sufficient downstaging to enable a radical resection, possibly improving survival.
Case series	This study aimed to assess the perioperative and oncologic outcomes of a salvage robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) in patients with cT4b esophageal cancer after dCRT.
Case series	Methods: Between June 2012 and November 2019, patients who underwent a RAMIE with a gastric conduit reconstruction after completion of dCRT for cT4b esophageal carcinoma were identified from a prospectively maintained surgical database at the University Medical Center Utrecht.
Case series	Results: In total, 24 patients with a histopathologically confirmed T4b adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were included. The adjacent organs involved were the tracheobronchial tree (67%), aorta (21%) or both (13%).
Case series	No conversions or major intraoperative complications were observed. A radical resection was achieved in 22 patients (92%), and a pathologic complete response was observed in 13 (54%) patients.
Case series	Postoperative grade 2 or higher complications occurred in 20 patients (83%). The disease-free survival at 24 months was 68% for the patients in whom a radical resection was achieved.
Case series	Conclusion: In patients with cT4b esophageal cancer treated with dCRT followed by a salvage RAMIE, a radical resection rate of 92% was achieved, with acceptable complications and promising survival rates.
Case series	These results demonstrate the feasibility of a curative surgical treatment for patients with initially irresectable esophageal cancer but underscore the importance of a proper preoperative patient selection.
Case series	Salvage Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy (RAMIE) for T4b Esophageal Cancer After Definitive Chemoradiotherapy
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Uncontrolled studies suggest that chemoradiation has similar efficacy as surgery for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Therefore, a randomized trial was carried out to compare, in responders only, chemoradiation alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery in patients with locally advanced tumors.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligible patients had operable T3N0-1M0 thoracic esophageal cancer. Patients received two cycles of fluorouracil (FU) and cisplatin (days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) and either conventional (46 Gy in 4.
randomized controlled trial	5 weeks) or split-course (15 Gy, days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) concomitant radiotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with response and no contraindication to either treatment were randomly assigned to surgery (arm A) or continuation of chemoradiation (arm B; three cycles of FU/cisplatin and either conventional [20 Gy] or split-course [15 Gy] radiotherapy).
randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiation was considered equivalent to surgery if the difference in 2-year survival rate was less than 10%. Results: Of 444 eligible patients, 259 were randomly assigned; 230 patients (88. 8%) had epidermoid cancer, and 29 (11.
randomized controlled trial	2%) had glandular carcinoma. Two-year survival rate was 34% in arm A versus 40% in arm B (hazard ratio for arm B v arm A = 0. 90; adjusted P =. 44). Median survival time was 17. 7 months in arm A compared with 19. 3 months in arm B.
randomized controlled trial	Two-year local control rate was 66. 4% in arm A compared with 57. 0% in arm B, and stents were less required in the surgery arm (5% in arm A v 32% in arm B; P <. 001). The 3-month mortality rate was 9. 3% in arm A compared with 0. 8% in arm B (P =.
randomized controlled trial	002). Cumulative hospital stay was 68 days in arm A compared with 52 days in arm B (P =. 02).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Our data suggest that, in patients with locally advanced thoracic esophageal cancers, especially epidermoid, who respond to chemoradiation, there is no benefit for the addition of surgery after chemoradiation compared with the continuation of additional chemoradiation.

Case series	Aim: To clarify the clinical significance of definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and CRT followed by esophagectomy for cT4 esophageal cancer.
Case series	Patients and methods: The treatment results for cT4 esophageal cancer were examined in 81 patients who received definitive CRT [radiation 50-70 Gy, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil; group I] and 19 patients who underwent esophagectomy after preoperative CRT [40Gy, Group II].
Case series	Results: Among the 81 patients in group I, toxicities (grade 3 or 4) were observed in 32 patients, while partial response and complete response were recognized in 8 and 47 patients, respectively.
Case series	Of the 19 group II patients, an R0 resection was performed in 16 patients, and the mortality rate was 5%. The 5-year survival rates were 19% and 42% in groups I and II, respectively.
Case series	Conclusion: Long-term survival can be expected after multimodal therapy, even for patients with cT4 esophageal cancer. Esophagectomy is therefore a valid treatment option when down-staging can be achieved.
Case series	Clinical significance of chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection for cT4 esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: T4 esophageal cancer often portends a dismal prognosis even after surgical resection. Historical incomplete resections and poor survival rates often make surgery palliative rather than curative.
Case series	Methods: Using a comprehensive esophageal cancer database, we identified patients who underwent an esophagectomy for T4 tumors between 1994 and 2011.
Case series	Neoadjuvant treatment (NT) and pathologic response variables were recorded, and response was denoted as complete response (pCR), partial response (pPR), and nonresponse (NR). Clinical and pathologic data were compared.
Case series	Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests for significance. Results: We identified 45 patients with T4 tumors all who underwent NT.
Case series	The median age was 60 years (range, 31-79 years) with a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 0-122 months). There were 19 pCR (42 %), 22 pPR (49 %), and 4 NR (9 %). R0 resections were accomplished in 43 (96 %).
Case series	There were 18 recurrences (40 %) with a median time to recurrence of 13. 5 months (2. 2-71 months). In this group pCR represented 7 (38. 9 %), whereas pPR and NR represented 10 (55. 5 %), and 1 (5. 5 %) respectively.
Case series	The overall and disease-free survival for all patients with T4 tumors were 35 and 36 %, respectively.
Case series	Patients achieving a pCR had a 5 year overall and disease-free survival of 53 and 54 %, compared with pPR 23 and 28 %, while there were no 5 year survivors in the NR cohort.
Case series	Conclusion: We have demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapy and downstaging of T4 tumors leads to increased R0 resections and improvements in overall and disease-free survival.
Case series	Outcomes associated with surgery for T4 esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: The objective of the study was to determine the utility of integrated computed tomography / positron emission tomography (CT-PET) imaging for detecting interval distant metastases and assessing therapeutic response in patients with locally advanced, potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Methods: A retrospective study was performed of 88 patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma who received neoadjuvant therapy before planned surgical resection.
Case series	CT-PET before and after completion of neoadjuvant was used for evaluating therapeutic response; response criteria were based on qualitative and semiquantitative analyses.
Case series	Results: Neoadjuvant therapy comprised chemoradiotherapy in 85 patients, with prior induction chemotherapy in 39 patients. Fifty-five patients proceeded to esophagectomy.
Case series	Repeat CT-PET was performed after induction chemotherapy (n = 23) and after completing chemoradiotherapy (n = 85). CT-PET identified the interval appearance of metastatic disease in 7 (8%) patients.
Case series	For assessment of locoregional therapeutic response, CT-PET was unable to predict pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in the primary tumor or locoregional lymph nodes.
Case series	CT-PET had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 57%, 46%, 39%, and 64%, respectively, for detection of residual macroscopic malignancy within the primary tumor; and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 0%, 90%, 0%, and 69% for detection of residual malignancy within resected lymph nodes.
Case series	Conclusions: CT-PET performed after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma is important for detecting interval metastases that preclude surgical resection, but is of limited utility for assessing locoregional therapeutic response.
Case series	Detection of interval distant metastases: clinical utility of integrated CT-PET imaging in patients with esophageal carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy
Cohort study	Purpose: The aim of this large multicenter study was to assess the impact of salvage esophagectomy after definitive chemoradiotherapy (SALV) on clinical outcome.
Cohort study	Patients and methods: Data from consecutive adult patients undergoing resection for esophageal cancer in 30 European centers from 2000 to 2010 were collected.
Cohort study	First, groups undergoing SALV (n = 308) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by planned esophagectomy (NCRS; n = 540) were compared.
Cohort study	Second, patients who benefited from SALV for persistent (n = 234) versus recurrent disease (n = 74) were compared. Propensity score matching and multivariable analyses were used to compensate for differences in some baseline characteristics.
Cohort study	Results: SALV versus NCRS groups: In-hospital mortality was similar in both groups (8. 4% v 9. 3%). The only significant differences in complications were seen for anastomotic leak (17. 2% v 10. 7%; P =.
Cohort study	007) and surgical site infection, which were both more frequent in the SALV group. At 3 years, groups had similar overall (43. 3% v 40. 1%; P =. 542) and disease-free survival (39. 2% v 32. 8%; P =.
Cohort study	232) after matching, along with a similar recurrence pattern. Persistent versus recurrent disease groups: There were no significant differences between groups in incidence of in-hospital mortality or major complications. At 3 years, overall (40.
Cohort study	9% v 56. 2%; P =. 046) and disease-free survival (36. 6% v 51. 6%; P =. 095) were lower in the persistent disease group.
Cohort study	Conclusion: The results of this large multicenter study from the modern era suggest that SALV can offer acceptable short- and long-term outcomes in selected patients at experienced centers.
Cohort study	Persistent cancer after definitive chemoradiotherapy seems to be more biologically aggressive, with poorer survival compared with recurrent cancer.
Cohort study	Salvage Surgery After Chemoradiotherapy in the Management of Esophageal Cancer: Is It a Viable Therapeutic Option?
Case series	Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of salvage surgery following definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: We reviewed patients undergoing salvage esophagectomy from August 2000 through April 2006 at the National Cancer Center Hospital East, following 5-fluorouracil and cisplatinum chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy over 50 Gy.
Case series	Clinicopathological backgrounds, complications, and survival were analyzed. Results: Forty-six patients (42 men, all with squamous cell carcinoma) underwent salvage surgery after full-dose concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	The median age was 61 years (range, 43-72). Thirteen patients had a relapse after complete response; 26 patients partial response; 4 patients progressive disease; 3 patients NC to CRT.
Case series	Salvage surgery consisted of transthoracic esophagectomy, three-field node dissection, and reconstruction with the colon or stomach with vascular restoration. Operation time ranged from 257 to 602 min.
Case series	Postoperative complications were pneumonia in 5; anastmotic leakage in 10; wound infection in 3; anastomotic stenosis in 2; recurrent nerve palsy in 4; pyothorax in 2; multiple organ failure in 1; myocardial infarction in 1; trachea necrosis in 1.
Case series	There were four 30-day operative deaths and three more hospital deaths. The median survival time from salvage surgery was 12 months and that from CRT was 22 months. The 3-year survival rate was 17%.
Case series	Three patients are surviving more than 3 years and their diseases were pathological NO. Conclusion: Mobidity and mortality rates were high among patients undergoing salvage esophagectomy.
Case series	However, there are some long-term survivors, and highly selected patients should be indicated for salvage surgery.
Case series	Salvage esophagectomy following definitive chemoradiotherapy
Cohort study	Background: Standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced esophageal cancer is definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT).
Cohort study	Although salvage esophagectomy is the only curative treatment available following dCRT failure, the appropriate candidates for salvage esophagectomy remain unclear.
Cohort study	Patients and methods: Three hundred seventeen patients who underwent dCRT from April 2004 to December 2016 were stratified into three study groups-a complete response (CR) group, chemotherapy or best supportive care (BSC) group, and salvage esophagectomy group-and compared.
Cohort study	We also investigated the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of salvage esophagectomy. Results: Seventy-one patients (22. 4%) achieved CR after dCRT, 18 patients (5. 7%) underwent salvage esophagectomy, and 228 patients (71.
Cohort study	9%) underwent palliative chemotherapy or BSC. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the CR group, salvage esophagectomy group, and chemotherapy or BSC group were 83. 0%, 51. 6%, and 1. 3%, respectively.
Cohort study	Salvage esophagectomy recipients had a worse OS rate than CR patients (p < 0. 001) but a better OS rate than those in the chemotherapy or BSC group (p < 0. 001).
Cohort study	Incomplete resection was the only significant variable associated with poor OS on univariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis (hazard ratio: 7. 633, 95% confidence interval: 1. 692-34. 482; p = 0. 008).
Cohort study	Patients with tumors in the upper thoracic esophagus were more likely to undergo incomplete resection (p = 0. 011). Conclusions: Patients who achieve R0 resection are good candidates for salvage esophagectomy regardless of their response to dCRT.
Cohort study	Those with upper thoracic esophageal tumors are at risk of incomplete resection; careful attention is required when considering these patients for salvage esophagectomy.
Cohort study	Appropriate Candidates for Salvage Esophagectomy of Initially Unresectable Locally Advanced T4 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Cohort study	Objectives: Some patients and oncologists choose to treat localized esophageal cancer with definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy rather than surgery.
Cohort study	A subset of these patients have local relapse without distant metastases and therefore have no other curative intent treatment option but salvage esophagectomy. Methods: We reviewed our experience with salvage esophagectomy from 1987 to 2000 at M. D.
Cohort study	Anderson Cancer Center (n = 13, salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group) and compared the data with those of patients receiving esophagectomy in a planned fashion 4 to 6 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 99, preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group).
Cohort study	Results: Increases in morbidity were seen after resection in the salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group relative to the preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group: mechanical ventilation (9. 0 days vs 3. 3 days, P =.
Cohort study	08), intensive care unit stay (11. 2 days vs 5. 1 days, P =. 07), hospital stay (29. 4 days vs 18. 4 days, P =. 03), and anastomotic leak rates (5/13 [39%] vs 7/99 [7%], P =. 005).
Cohort study	Operative mortality (within 30 days) also tended to be increased statistically nonsignificantly (2/13 [15%] vs 6/99 [6%], P =. 2). Salvage esophagectomy resulted in long-term survival (25% 5-year survival) in a subset of patients.
Cohort study	Improved survival after salvage esophagectomy was associated with early pathologic stage (T1 N0, T2 N0), prolonged time to relapse, and R0 surgical resection.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Patients who undergo salvage esophagectomy for relapse of tumor after definitive chemoradiation therapy have increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital use relative to patients undergoing planned esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation.
Cohort study	Nevertheless, long-term survival can be achieved in this group, and such treatment should be considered for carefully selected patients at an experienced center.
Cohort study	Salvage esophagectomy for recurrent tumors after definitive chemotherapy and radiotherapy
Case series	Aims: The clinical benefit of salvage oesophagectomy in patients who recur after radical chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is not clearly defined.
Case series	This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome in patients who underwent salvage oesophagectomy having failed primary CRT.
Case series	Materials and methods: Between March 1999 and October 2005, 181 patients with oesophageal cancer were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital with definitive CRT. Ten patients underwent salvage oesophagectomy.
Case series	All of them had locally advanced cancer of the oesophagus at presentation (adenocarcinoma in three patients and squamous cell carcinoma in seven patients) and received combined CRT, consisting of 12 weeks of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy followed by CRT.
Case series	Radiotherapy was delivered with a computed tomography-planned technique to a dose of 54 Gy with daily 5-fluorouracil. Results: An Ivor-Lewis procedure was carried out in all cases.
Case series	The median time between the end of CRT and surgery was 5 months (range 1-67). Curative resection was achieved in three patients, seven had microscopic positive circumferential margins.
Case series	One patient died postoperatively and complications occurred in four cases: anastomotic leak in two patients, pneumonia in one patient, empyema and sepsis in one patient.
Case series	The median critical care unit stay was 7 days (range 4-26) and hospitalisation was 21 days (range 15-84). With a median follow-up period of 45.
Case series	5 months (range 5-89) the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival calculated from the completion of CRT was 70, 50 and 30%, respectively. Median survival was 21. 5 months (range 8-90).
Case series	Conclusions: Salvage oesophagectomy may prolong survival in carefully selected patients with local relapse. Patients fit for surgery at presentation benefit from a more intensive follow-up protocol to detect early recurrence.
Case series	Oesophagectomy after definitive chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is one treatment option for locally advanced oesophageal carcinoma. CRT typically consists of high-dose (50-66 Gy) external beam radiotherapy concurrent with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin.
Case series	When definitive CRT fails to achieve local control, salvage oesophagectomy is frequently the only treatment available that can offer a chance of long-term survival.
Case series	Methods: Online databases were searched for publications relating to salvage oesophagectomy and definitive CRT. Nine series containing a total of 105 patients were reviewed.
Case series	Demographics, indications for surgery, type of resection, complications and outcome data were extracted. Results: Each centre performed one to three salvage resections per year comprising 1. 7-4. 1 per cent of the oesophagectomy workload.
Case series	The overall anastomotic leak rate was 17. 1 per cent. The in-hospital mortality rate was 11. 4 per cent. Five-year survival rates of 25-35 per cent were achieved. Prognostic factors for increased survival were R0 resection (P = 0.
Case series	006) and longer interval between CRT and recurrence (P = 0. 002). Conclusion: Salvage resection after CRT is feasible for selected patients but is a formidable undertaking.
Case series	Restaging investigations after CRT for potentially resectable tumours in fit candidates should include endoscopy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography.
Case series	Salvage oesophagectomy is carried out with the goal of cure and it should be attempted only if an R0 resection is technically possible.
Case series	Salvage oesophagectomy after local failure of definitive chemoradiotherapy
Case series	Background: In patients who are nonresponders to primary radiochemotherapy (RCT), prognosis is poor, leading mostly to palliation. Salvage surgery may have a survival benefit otherwise complete.
Case series	Our aim was to identify predictors of R0 resection in these patients. Methods: In 98 nonresponders with locally advanced infracarinal tumors, curative salvage surgery was attempted. Resection was R0 in 62. 2% and incomplete in 37. 8% of cases.
Case series	Univariate and multivariate analyses included pre-RCT and post-RCT variables collected prospectively. Results: Overall survival was higher in the R0 resection group (18. 4 vs 8. 6 months, P <. 001).
Case series	Independent predictors of R0 resection were tumor height <or= 5 cm on barium swallow (P =. 045) and aortic contact <or= 90 degrees on computed tomography (P =. 039) evaluated after RCT.
Case series	Three groups of patients were constructed: 1, tumor height <or= 5 cm with aortic contact <or= 90 degrees (n = 43); 2, tumor height between 6 and 10 cm with aortic contact <or= 90 degrees (n = 32); and 3, aortic contact > 90 degrees , irrespective of tumor height (n = 23).
Case series	Rates of R0 resection were 81%, 53%, and 39%, respectively (P =. 001).
Case series	Conclusion: Salvage esophagectomy should be systematically attempted in nonresponders with tumor height <or= 5 cm on barium swallow and aortic contact <or= 90 degrees on computed tomography and discussed case by case for other patients.
Case series	Patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma nonresponder to radiochemotherapy: who will benefit from surgery?
Case series	Objective: Some patients with localised oesophageal cancer are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) rather than surgery.
Case series	A subset of these patients experiences local failure, relapse or treatment-related complication without distant metastases, with no other curative treatment option but salvage oesophagectomy.
Case series	The aim of this study was to assess the benefit/risk ratio of surgery in such context. Methods: Review of a single institution experience with 24 patients: 18 men and 6 women, with a mean age of 59 years (+/-9).
Case series	Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 18 cases and adenocarcinoma in 6. Initial stages were cIIA (n=5), cIIB (n=1) and cIII (n=18).
Case series	CRT consisted of 2-6 sessions of the association 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin concomitantly with a 50-75 Gy radiation therapy.
Case series	Salvage oesophagectomy was considered for the following reasons: relapse of the disease with conclusive (n=11) or inconclusive biopsies (n=7), intractable stenosis (n=3), and perforation or severe oesophagitis (n=3), at a mean delay of 74 days (14-240 days) following completion of CRT.
Case series	Results: All patients underwent a transthoracic en-bloc oesophagectomy with 2-field lymphadenectomy. Thirty-day and 90-day mortality rates were 21% and 25%, respectively. Anastomotic leakage (p=0. 05), cardiac failure (p=0. 05), length of stay (p=0.
Case series	03) and the number of packed red blood cells (p=0. 02) were more frequent in patients who received more than 55 Gy, leading to a doubled in-hospital mortality when compared to that of patients having received lower doses.
Case series	A R0 resection was achieved in 21 patients (87. 5%). A complete pathological response (ypT0N0) was observed in 3 patients (12. 5%). Overall and disease-free 5-year survival rates were 35% and 21%, respectively.
Case series	There was no long-term survivor following R1-R2 resections. Functional results were good in more than 80% of the long-term survivors.
Case series	Conclusion: Salvage surgery is a highly invasive and morbid operation after a volume dose of radiation exceeding 55 Gy. The indication must be carefully considered, with care taken to avoid incomplete resections.
Case series	Given that long-term survival with a fair quality of life can be achieved, such high-risk surgery should be considered in selected patients at an experienced centre.
Case series	Indications and outcome of salvage surgery for oesophageal cancer
review	Definitive chemoradiation (without esophagectomy) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by planned esophagectomy are commonly used treatments for locally advanced esophageal cancer.
review	These two treatment strategies have similar survival outcomes, so the value of planned esophagectomy is debated. However, persistence or recurrence of local disease is not uncommon after definitive chemoradiation.
review	Salvage esophagectomy for isolated local failures of definitive chemoradiation is an option for selected patients.
review	In this article we review the debate over definitive chemoradiation versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery, and then restate the argument in terms of salvage versus planned esophagectomy.
review	Although both forms of esophagectomy are done in the setting of previous chemoradiation, they are different in several ways. Salvage esophagectomy appears to be a more morbid operation than planned esophagectomy.
review	Surgeons supportive of the salvage esophagectomy strategy face the challenge of reducing its postoperative mortality.
review	Salvage or planned esophagectomy after chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer--a review
Cohort study	Background and objectives: Although locoregional failure frequently occurs after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT), the role of salvage esophagectomy has not been fully evaluated.
Cohort study	The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of salvage esophagectomy after high-dose definitive CRT with neoadjuvant CRT.
Cohort study	Methods: From 1994 to 2007, 33 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer underwent salvage esophagectomy after definitive CRT, and 115 patients underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery.
Cohort study	Results: The postoperative mortality rate in the salvage group (12%) was higher than in the neoadjuvant group (3. 6%, P = 0. 059).
Cohort study	The rates of postoperative complications were significantly higher in the salvage group than in neoadjuvant group: Anastomotic leakage (39% vs. 22%, respectively, P = 0. 049), bleeding (15% vs. 1. 7%, respectively, P = 0.
Cohort study	002), cardiovascular complications (24% vs. 5. 4%, respectively, P = 0. 001).
Cohort study	Univariate analysis showed that pretherapy T stage, pretherapy lymph node status, pathological T stage, and operative curability were significant prognostic factors affecting survival of patients who underwent salvage esophagectomy.
Cohort study	In particular, patients with cT3-T4 tumors or cN1 tumors before definitive CRT showed worse prognosis after salvage esophagectomy.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Salvage esophagectomy after high-dose definitive CRT was associated with higher postoperative mortality and morbidity rates compared with neoadjuvant CRT. Only selected patients can be rescued by salvage esophagectomy.
Cohort study	Salvage esophagectomy after definitive chemoradiotherapy for thoracic esophageal cancer
Cohort study	Background: Definitive radiochemotherapy (dRCT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer is associated with a high rate of loco-regional recurrence. In this condition, salvage esophagectomy may be considered as a therapeutic option.
Cohort study	The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the feasibility and the morbi-mortality of this strategy. Methods: Between January 2006 and April 2014, 208 patients underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer at ULB-Erasme-Bordet.
Cohort study	Thirty-two patients received a preoperative radiochemotherapy (pRCT) followed by planned esophagectomy (Group 1) for locally advanced disease. Sixteen patients underwent salvage esophagectomy for recurrence or failure after dRCT (Group 2).
Cohort study	Data on post-operative morbidity and mortality and survival were collected and analyzed. Results: An increase of overall morbidity was detected in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (43% vs. 37. 5%), mainly related to respiratory complications (35. 5% vs.
Cohort study	28%) and anastomotic leak (25% vs. 3%). No 90-days mortality was observed in the two surgical groups. The 1, 2, and 3-year survival rates after surgery were respectively 89%, 80%, and 71% for Group1 and 84%, 73%, and 63% for Group 2.
Cohort study	Conclusions: In our experience, both salvage esophagectomy and esophagectomy after pRCT showed good survival results with low postoperative morbidity and mortality. Salvage surgery remains a therapeutic indication in selected patients. J. Surg. Oncol.

Cohort study	Salvage esophagectomy after failure of definitive radiochemotherapy for esophageal cancer
Case series	Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify good candidates for salvage esophagectomy after definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT), based on safety and survival.
Case series	Methods: Sixty-three patients who underwent salvage esophagectomy, after dCRT, at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, between 1988 and 2013, were retrospectively analyzed.
Case series	Short-term outcomes were evaluated by reviewing postoperative complications, length of postoperative hospital stay, and mortality.
Case series	Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical significance was determined using the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of overall survival.
Case series	Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors related to R0 resection. Results: Postoperative complications occurred in 41 patients (65. 1 %), and the mortality rate was 7. 9 %.
Case series	In-hospital deaths did not occur among patients with less advanced tumors prior to dCRT (cT1-2 and cN0), or among those who had previously achieved a complete response (CR); the 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 29. 8 % and 15.
Case series	0 %, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that residual disease, tumor depth, dCRT response, lymph node metastasis, and time to relapse were significant factors affecting overall survival.
Case series	Multivariate analysis demonstrated that R0 resection and ypT0-2 tumors were significant, favorable prognostic factors in patients undergoing salvage esophagectomy.
Case series	In addition, cT1-2 tumors, initially resectable tumors, ycT1-2 tumors, and relapse after CR were factors predicting R0 resection.
Case series	Conclusions: Based on both short- and long-term outcomes, patients with pretreatment or preoperative T1-2 tumors and those with relapse after CR are good candidates for salvage esophagectomy.
Case series	Salvage Esophagectomy After Definitive Chemoradiotherapy for Patients with Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Who Really Benefits from this High-Risk Surgery?
Case series	Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between clinical complete response (cCR) and pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC).
Case series	Methods: Between May 2001 and April 2013, a total of 158 patients with thoracic ESCC treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery were analyzed. Of these patients, 31 had stage IIb disease and 127 had stage III disease.
Case series	All patients received concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy with conformal radiotherapy (40 Gy in 20 fractions, five fractions per week for 4 weeks). Results: A total of 65 patients (41. 1 %) achieved pCR. Of 44 patients (27.
Case series	8 %) who achieved cCR after neoadjuvant CRT, 32 (72. 7 %) also achieved pCR. On the other hand, only 33 (28. 9 %) of 114 patients with non-cCR had pCR.
Case series	The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of cCR for predicting pCR was 87. 1, 49. 2, 71. 1, and 72. 7 %, respectively. The median follow-up period was 28.
Case series	9 months, and overall survival (OS) for the entire group was 38. 1 months. Patients who achieved cCR had significantly better 3-year OS than those with non-cCR (71. 6 % vs. 46. 9 %; p = 0. 012).
Case series	Conclusions: Our results indicate that cCR after neoadjuvant CRT is significantly correlated with pCR and survival of patients with ESCC. Further studies are required to confirm the prognostic value of cCR after neoadjuvant CRT.
Case series	Is There a Correlation Between Clinical Complete Response and Pathological Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer?
Case series	Background: A pathologically complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is seen in 30% of the patients with oesophageal cancer.
Case series	The aim is to identify patient and tumour characteristics associated with a pCR and to develop a nomogram for the prediction of pCR.
Case series	Patients and methods: Patients who underwent nCRT followed by surgery were identified and response to nCRT was assessed according to a modified Mandard classification in the resection specimen.
Case series	A model was developed with age, gender, histology and location of the tumour, differentiation grade, alcohol use, smoking, percentage weight loss, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), cT-stage and cN-stage as potential predictors for pCR.
Case series	Probability of pCR was studied via logistic regression. Performance of the prediction nomogram was quantified using the concordance statistic (c-statistic) and corrected for optimism. Results: A total of 381 patients were included. After surgery, 27.
Case series	6% of the tumours showed a pCR. Female sex, squamous cell histology, poor differentiation grade, and low cT-stage were predictive for a pCR with a c-statistic of 0. 64 (corrected for optimism).
Case series	Conclusion: A nomogram for the prediction of pathologically complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was developed, with a reasonable predictive power.
Case series	This nomogram needs external validation before it can be used for individualised clinical decision-making.
Case series	Nomogram for predicting pathologically complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Results from the recent CROSS trial showed that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) significantly increased survival as compared to surgery alone in patients with potentially curable esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Furthermore, in the nCRT arm 49% of patients with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 23% of patients with an adenocarcinoma (AC) had a pathologically complete response in the resection specimen.
Non-randomized controlled trial	These results provide a rationale to reconsider and study the timing and necessity of esophagectomy in (all) patients after application of the CROSS regimen. Objective: We propose a "surgery as needed" approach after completion of nCRT.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In this approach, patients will undergo active surveillance after completion of nCRT. Surgical resection would be offered only to those patients in whom residual disease or a locoregional recurrence is highly suspected or proven.
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, before a surgery as needed approach in oesophageal cancer patients (SANO) can be tested in a randomized controlled trial, we aim to determine the accuracy of detecting the presence or absence of residual disease after nCRT (preSANO trial).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: This study is set up as a prospective, single arm, multicenter, diagnostic trial. Operable patients with potentially curable SCC or AC of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction will be included.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Approximately 4-6 weeks after completion of nCRT all included patients will undergo a first clinical response evaluation (CRE-I) including endoscopy with (random) conventional mucosal biopsies of the primary tumor site and of any other suspected lesions in the esophagus and radial endo-ultrasonography (EUS) for measurement of tumor thickness and area.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients in whom no locoregional or disseminated disease can be proven by cytohistology will be offered a postponed surgical resection 6-8 weeks after CRE-I (ie, approximately 12-14 weeks after completion of nCRT).
Non-randomized controlled trial	In the week preceding the postponed surgical resection, a second clinical response evaluation (CRE-II) will be planned that will include a whole body PET-CT, followed again by endoscopy with (random) conventional mucosal biopsies of the primary tumor site and any other suspected lesions in the esophagus, radial EUS for measurement of tumor thickness and area, and linear EUS plus fine needle aspiration of PET-positive lesions and/or suspected lymph nodes.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The main study parameter is the correlation between the clinical response assessment during CRE-I and CRE-II and the final pathological response in the resection specimen.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: The first patient was enrolled on July 23, 2013, and results are expected in January 2016.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: If this preSANO trial shows that the presence or absence of residual tumor can be predicted reliably 6 or 12 weeks after completion of nCRT, a randomized trial comparing nCRT plus standard surgery versus chemoradiotherapy plus "surgery as needed" will be conducted (SANO trial).

Non-randomized controlled trial	Accuracy of Detecting Residual Disease After Cross Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer (preSANO Trial): Rationale and Protocol
meta analysis	Background: The majority of oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage and palliative treatment is the realistic management option for most patients.
meta analysis	The optimal intervention for the palliation of dysphagia in these patients has not been established.
meta analysis	Objectives: To systematically analyse and summarise the efficacy of different interventions used in the palliation of dysphagia in primary oesophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	Search strategy: We undertook a search according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and major conference proceedings up to August 2005.
meta analysis	The literature search was re-run in August 2006 and March 2007. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer who underwent palliative treatment.
meta analysis	We included rigid plastic intubation, self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head-to-head or in combination.
meta analysis	The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30-day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: One author assessed the eligibility criteria of each study and extracted data regarding outcomes and factors affecting risk of bias. Main results: We included 2542 patients from 40 studies.
meta analysis	SEMS insertion is safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provide comparable dysphagia palliation but have an increased requirement for re-interventions and adverse effects.
meta analysis	Anti-reflux stents provide comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti-reflux stents might reduce gastro-oesophageal reflux compared to conventional metal stents.
meta analysis	Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: Self-expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities.
meta analysis	However, high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life.
meta analysis	Self-expanding metal stent insertion and brachytherapy provide comparable palliation to endoscopic ablative therapy but are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re-interventions.
meta analysis	Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, chemotherapy alone, combination chemoradiotherapy and bypass surgery are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia.
meta analysis	Interventions for dysphagia in oesophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Brachytherapy was found to be preferable to metal stent placement for the palliation of dysphagia because of inoperable esophageal cancer in the randomized SIREC trial.
Case series	The benefit of brachytherapy, however, only occurred after a relatively long survival. The objective is to develop a model that distinguishes patients with a poor prognosis from those with a relatively good prognosis.
Case series	Methods: Survival was analyzed with Cox regression analysis. Dysphagia-adjusted survival (alive with no or mild dysphagia) was studied with Kaplan-Meier analysis.
Case series	Patient data is from the multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (SIREC, n = 209) and a consecutive series (n = 396). Patients received a stent or single-dose brachytherapy.
Case series	Results: Significant prognostic factors for survival included tumor length, World Health Organization performance score, and the presence of metastases (multivariable p < 0. 001).
Case series	A simple score, which also included age and gender, could satisfactorily separate patients with a poor, intermediate, and relatively good prognosis within the SIREC trial.
Case series	For the poor prognosis group, the difference in dysphagia-adjusted survival was 23 days in favor of stent placement compared with brachytherapy (77 vs. 54 days, p = 0. 16).
Case series	For the other prognostic groups, brachytherapy resulted in a better dysphagia-adjusted survival.
Case series	Conclusions: A simple prognostic score may help to identify patients with a poor prognosis in whom stent placement is at least equivalent to brachytherapy.
Case series	If further validated, this score can provide an evidence-based tool for the selection of palliative treatment in esophageal cancer patients.
Case series	Stent placement or brachytherapy for palliation of dysphagia from esophageal cancer: a prognostic model to guide treatment selection
Case series	In a pilot study between May 1988 and May 1989, ten consecutive patients with advanced esophageal cancer were treated with a short intensive course of intraluminal curietherapy without external beam irradiation at the Kaiser Permanente-Los Angeles Medical Center.
Case series	Nine of ten patients achieved effective palliation comparable to that of standard external beam teletherapy from other series.
Case series	Most patients had already failed other palliative modalities including chemotherapy, laser debridement, dilation, and electrocautery. The duration of response was generally longer than with these techniques.
Case series	All patients completed therapy, and tolerance was excellent.
Case series	Intraluminal irradiation is an attractive, effectual therapeutic alternative, especially in patients with advanced local or distant disease unlikely to tolerate 5 to 7 weeks of external beam therapy.
Case series	Effective palliation for inoperable esophageal cancer using intensive intracavitary radiation
Case series	From September 1987 to December 1989, 36 patients with advanced esophageal cancer entered a study in order to determine the efficacy of palliation by a single session of intraluminal irradiation.
Case series	A dose of 15 Gy was administered at 1 cm distance from the central axis of the applicator. In 22 of 32 patients alive at least 6 weeks after treatment dysphagia improved, in 14 this relief was complete.
Case series	Re-obstruction occurred in 8 of the 22 responders, but a second treatment with intraluminal irradiation gave improvement in six. Intraesophageal prostheses were needed in only 6 of the 36 patients.
Case series	Intraluminal irradiation is easy to administer and safe, it forms a useful addition to the therapeutic possibilities for the palliation of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Palliation in esophageal cancer with a single session of intraluminal irradiation
randomized controlled trial	Background: Previous studies from South Africa have established that fractionated high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy gives the best results in terms of palliation and survival in advanced esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	A multicenter, prospective randomized study was therefore conducted under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency to evaluate two HDR regimens.
randomized controlled trial	Methods and materials: Surgically inoperable patients with histologically proven squamous cell cancer of the esophagus, tumor >5 cm in length on barium swallow and/or endoscopy, Karnofsky performance score >50, age 17-70 years, primary disease in the thoracic esophagus, no prior malignancy within the past 5 years, and any N or M status were included in the study.
randomized controlled trial	Exclusion criteria included cervical esophagus location, tumor extending <1 cm from the gastroesophageal junction, tracheoesophageal fistula, Karnofsky performance score <50, altered mental status, and extension to great vessels on CT.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomized to receive 18 Gy in 3 fractions on alternate days (6 Gy per fraction, Group A) or 16 Gy in 2 fractions on alternate days (8 Gy per fraction, Group B).
randomized controlled trial	The HDR dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the center of the source axis after dose optimization. A margin of 2 cm was included proximally and distally.
randomized controlled trial	The respective hospital and university committees gave approval for the study, and all patients provided informed consent. Results: A total of 232 patients were entered into the study (112 in Group A and 120 in Group B).
randomized controlled trial	There was no difference between the groups for any of the prognostic variables. All patients were followed until death. The dysphagia-free survival for the whole group was 7. 1 months (Group A, 7. 8 months; Group B, 6. 3 months; p >0. 05).
randomized controlled trial	The overall survival was 7. 9 months for the whole group (Group A, 9. 1 months; Group B, 6. 9 months; p >0. 05). On univariate analysis, the presenting weight (p = 0. 0083), gender (p = 0. 0038), race (p = 0.
randomized controlled trial	0105), the presenting dysphagia score (p = 0. 0083), the treatment center (p = 0. 0029), and tumor grade (p = 0. 0029) had an impact on the dysphagia-free survival, and gender (p = 0. 0011) and performance score (p = 0.
randomized controlled trial	0060) had an impact on dysphagia-free survival on multivariate analysis. Only age had an impact on overall survival on both univariate (p = 0. 0430) and multivariate (p = 0. 0331) analysis.
randomized controlled trial	The incidence of strictures (Group A, n = 12; Group B, n = 13; p >0. 05) and fistulas (Group A, n = 11; Group B, n = 12; p >0. 05) was similar in both groups.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Fractionated HDR brachytherapy alone is an effective method of palliating advanced esophageal cancers, surpassing the results of any other modality of treatment presently available.
randomized controlled trial	Dose fractions of 6 Gy x 3 and 8 Gy x 2 give similar results for dysphagia-free survival, overall survival, strictures, and fistulas and are equally effective in palliation of advanced esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Prospective randomized trial of HDR brachytherapy as a sole modality in palliation of advanced esophageal carcinoma--an International Atomic Energy Agency study
randomized controlled trial	Background: Both single-dose brachytherapy and self-expanding metal stent placement are commonly used for palliation of oesophageal obstruction due to inoperable cancer, but their relative merits are unknown.
randomized controlled trial	We undertook a randomised trial to compare the outcomes of brachytherapy and stent placement in patients with oesophageal cancer. Methods: Nine hospitals in the Netherlands participated in our study.
randomized controlled trial	Between December, 1999, and June, 2002, 209 patients with dysphagia from inoperable carcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction were randomly assigned to stent placement (n=108) or single-dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101), and were followed up after treatment.
randomized controlled trial	Primary outcome was relief of dysphagia during follow-up, and secondary outcomes were complications, treatment for persistent or recurrent dysphagia, health-related quality of life, and costs. Analysis was by intention to treat.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Nine patients (six [brachytherapy] vs three [stent placement]) did not receive their allocated treatments. None was lost to follow-up.
randomized controlled trial	Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. Stent placement had more complications than brachytherapy (36 [33%] of 108 vs 21 [21%] of 101; p=0.
randomized controlled trial	02), which was mainly due to an increased incidence of late haemorrhage (14 [13%] of 108 vs five [5%] of 101; p=0. 05). Groups did not differ for persistent or recurrent dysphagia (p=0. 81), or for median survival (p=0. 23).
randomized controlled trial	Quality-of-life scores were in favour of brachytherapy compared with stent placement. Total medical costs were also much the same for stent placement (8215) and brachytherapy (8135).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Despite slow improvement, single-dose brachytherapy gave better long-term relief of dysphagia than metal stent placement.
randomized controlled trial	Since brachytherapy was also associated with fewer complications than stent placement, we recommend it as the primary treatment for palliation of dysphagia from oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Single-dose brachytherapy versus metal stent placement for the palliation of dysphagia from oesophageal cancer: multicentre randomised trial
randomized controlled trial	Esophageal cancer often presents as advanced stage disease with a dismal prognosis, with only 10-15% of patients surviving 5 years. Therefore, in a large proportion of patients, palliative treatment is the only option available.
randomized controlled trial	The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the palliative effect of self-expandable stent placement with that of endoluminal brachytherapy regarding the effect on quality of life and on specific symptoms.
randomized controlled trial	Sixty-five patients with advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction were randomized to treatment with either an Ultraflex expandable stent or high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy with 7 Gy x 3 given in 2-4 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Clinical assessment and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were measured at inclusion and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later.
randomized controlled trial	The HRQL was measured with standardized questionnaires (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Oesophageal Module and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).
randomized controlled trial	Twenty-eight patients completed the stent treatment and 24 patients the brachytherapy. The group of patients treated with stent reported significantly better HRQL scores for dysphagia (P < 0.
randomized controlled trial	05) at the 1-month follow-up, but most other HRQL scores, including functioning and symptom scales, deteriorated.
randomized controlled trial	Among brachytherapy-treated patients, improvement was found for the dysphagia-related scores at the 3-months follow-up, whereas other significant changes of scores were few. The median survival time was comparable in the two groups (around 120 days).
randomized controlled trial	In conclusion, insertion of self-expandable metal stents offered a more instant relief of dysphagia compared to endoluminal brachytherapy, but HRQL was more stable in the brachytherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	Stent insertion or endoluminal brachytherapy as palliation of patients with advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial
Case series	We reviewed the records of 732 patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma to determine the efficacy of palliative therapy. Palliative resection was performed in 156 patients. Hospital mortality was 9. 6%, 1-year survival was 29.
Case series	1%, and median survival was 7. 8 months. Excellent or good palliative results were obtained in 78% of operative survivors. Bypass procedures were performed in 49 patients: hospital mortality was 20. 4%, with a median survival of 6. 2 months.
Case series	Excellent or good palliative results were obtained in 71% of operative survivors. Intubation of the tumor was performed in 254 patients. Thirty-day mortality was 10. 2%, and median survival was 4. 0 months. No patient received excellent palliation.
Case series	Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy or photodynamic therapy was performed in 50 patients. No procedure-related deaths were recorded, and median survival was 4. 1 months. Excellent or good results were obtained in 83% of patients.
Case series	Lesser procedures were performed in 106 patients, and 117 had only staging examinations. Although surgical palliation of esophageal cancer with resection or bypass provides good results, the cost is high.
Case series	Improvements in palliative results require reduction in operative mortality, increased accuracy of preoperative staging, continuing use of laser therapy, and increased use of chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiotherapy and operation.
Case series	Surgical and endoscopic palliation of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Substernal gastric bypass of the excluded thoracic esophagus for palliation of esophageal carcinoma was proposed as a method of providing maximum patient comfort with minimum morbidity.
Case series	Our results with this operation in 37 patients are reviewed and indicate that the procedure carries unacceptable complication and mortality rates.
Case series	Among our patients, there have been nine (24%) hospital deaths, seven (19%) anastomotic leaks, and six (17%) disruptions of the divided distal thoracic esophagus. Major postoperative complications have occurred in 59% of these patients.
Case series	Only 15 (54%) of the 28 survivors were discharged swallowing within 3 weeks of operation, and 10 (36%) required hospitalization for 1 month or longer after operation. The average survival time in those leaving the hospital alive has been only 5.
Case series	9 months. Only seven patients (25% of the survivors) have achieved good palliation with the bypass procedure.
Case series	It is concluded that substernal gastric bypass of the excluded thoracic esophagus is too much of an operation for patients with unresectable tumors who have a life expectancy of only several months.
Case series	Substernal gastric bypass of the excluded esophagus--results of an ill-advised operation
Case series	From 1973 to 1987, 235 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were treated at Hiroshima University. Of these patients, 121 (51. 5 per cent) were submitted to esophagectomy, 93 (39. 6 per cent) to bypass surgery and 21 (8.
Case series	9 per cent) to either exploratory or no surgery. In this report, the 93 cases who underwent bypass surgery were analysed. Ten patients died within thirty days after their operation (10. 8 per cent) and there were 33 cases of hospital death (35.
Case series	5 per cent). Following the bypass surgery, 49 (59. 0 per cent) cases were able to tolerate over 50 per cent of their normal oral intake and 22 cases (26. 5 per cent) were able to tolerate between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. For twelve cases (14.
Case series	6 per cent), however, oral ingestion proved impossible up until the time of death due to such complications as leakage. The overall survival rates were 44. 3 per cent at 6 months, 12. 7 per cent at 1 year and 2. 8 per cent at 5 years, respectively.
Case series	Two cases survived for over 5 years. Hyperthermia was applied in combination with chemotherapy from 1981, however, no case survived for over one year without radiation therapy.
Case series	Recently, radiation plus hyperthermia is being performed in combination with immunochemotherapy.
Case series	Bypass operation for advanced esophageal cancer--an analysis of 93 cases
review	Surgery and radiotherapy yield equivalent results for patients with carcinoma of the cervical esophagus, with long-term survival of less than one in four patients.
review	The advantages of radiotherapy are lower rates of acute morbidity and mortality compared with surgery, and potential for larynx preservation.
review	The advantage of surgery is that the transposed stomach may function better over the long term than an irradiated esophagus, which tends to become stenotic over time.
review	Patients with resectable cancers who are in good general medical condition may be treated with preoperative irradiation and surgery in an effort to improve the likelihood of local control and obtain a good functional result.
review	Patients with relatively early lesions who are not good surgical candidates can be treated with high-dose radiation therapy. Patients with very advanced local disease and those with distant metastases are treated with palliative irradiation.
review	Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been shown to be superior to radiotherapy alone in managing esophageal cancer.
review	Although relatively few patients with cervical esophageal cancer have been treated with this combination, some studies suggest it may be curative for patients with early lesions of the cervical esophagus, without the need for esophagectomy.
review	Adjuvant chemotherapy is usually not used outside of a study setting.
review	Management of Cervical Esophageal Carcinoma
Case series	Carcinoma of the cervical esophagus is a lethal tumor because of its advanced stage at the time of diagnosis.
Case series	The records of 71 patients with this disease treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1965 through 1980 have been reviewed herein.
Case series	Epidermoid carcinoma was the prevailing histologic finding, and extramural penetration was present in 77 percent of the evaluable patients.
Case series	Tracheal invasion and vocal cord paralysis were noted in 35 and 24 percent of the patients, respectively and were predictive of significantly decreased survival.
Case series	Primary radiotherapy in doses greater than 5,000 rads produced short lived responses in 13 of 21 patients (62 percent).
Case series	Surgery was performed in 45 patients (63 percent), including 35 esophagectomies for cure and palliative procedures in the 10 other patients. There were five operative deaths (11 percent), but only two followed esophageal resection (5. 6 percent).
Case series	Locoregional treatment failure, present in 46 of 52 evaluable patients (88 percent) at last follow-up, continues to be a major problem. Overall, the 5 year survival rate was 9. 6 percent.
Case series	The longest survival and best palliation was achieved with aggressive resection and immediate reconstruction using the transposed stomach (gastric pullup).
Case series	Carcinoma of the cervical esophagus: changing therapeutic trends
review	Background: The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the diagnosis, treatment options and treatment-related complications of cervical esophageal carcinoma (CEC) and to subsequently provide recommendations to improve quality of care.
review	Design: Studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. A total of 107 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included. Results: CEC is uncommon, accounting for 2%-10% of all esophageal carcinomas.
review	These tumors are often locally advanced at presentation and have a poor prognosis, with a 5-year overall survival of 30%. Tobacco and alcohol consumption seem to be the major risk factors for developing CEC.
review	Surgery is usually not possible due to the very close relationship to other organs such as the larynx, trachea and thyroid gland. Therefore, the current standard of care is definitive chemoradiation (dCRT) with curative intent.
review	Treatment regimens used to treat CEC are adapted by established regimens in lower esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, dCRT may be accompanied by severe side-effects and complications.
review	Several diagnostic and predictive markers have been studied, but currently, there is no other biomarker than clinical stage to determine patient management.
review	Suggestions to improve patient outcomes are to determine the exact radiation dose needed for adequate locoregional control and to combine radiotherapy with optimal systemic therapy backbone.
review	Conclusion: CEC remains unchartered territory for many practising physicians and patients with CEC have a poor prognosis.
review	To improve the outcome for CEC patients, future studies should focus on the identification of new diagnostic biomarkers or targets for radiosensitizers, amelioration of radiation schedules, optimal combination of chemotherapeutic agents and/or new therapeutic targets.
review	Cervical esophageal cancer: a gap in cancer knowledge
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: The effects of multimodality treatment on the survival of patients with esophageal carcinoma are unclear.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The authors performed a prospective, Phase II study to assess the long-term results of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (RT) on patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Of 106 consecutive patients who were recruited between 1985 and 1992, 101 patients were evaluable.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Cisplatin (100 mg/m2 per day) on Day 1 and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day) on Days 1-4 were given for two cycles, with concomitant RT (30 grays [Gy] in 15 fractions) over 19 days.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with potentially resectable tumors were then assessed for curative surgery; the other patients received two more courses of chemotherapy and further RT (20 Gy in 10 fractions).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 40 patients who were candidates for surgery, 32 patients underwent surgery, and 24 patients had complete resection; 8 patients (25%) had no residual tumor in the specimen, and 12 patients (37%) had microscopic foci only.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Surgical mortality was high (22%). Of 61 nonsurgical patients, 37 patients (61%) achieved complete clinical remission, and 14 patients (23%) achieved partial remission. The median survival for the entire series was 15 months (range, 1-136 months).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The overall survival rate was 22% at 5 years and 12% at 10 years. At 10 years, freedom from disease progression was similar in the two groups (24%), whereas the median survival (22 months vs. 12 months) and the overall survival rates (17% vs.
Non-randomized controlled trial	9%) were better in nonsurgical patients compared with surgical patients, respectively, probably in relation to high surgical mortality.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The larynx was preserved in 28% of 32 patients with cervical disease sites, with a 10-year disease free survival rate of 31%. Three deaths were attributed to nonsurgical treatments.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Careful multidisciplinary pretreatment evaluation can identify patients who are ineligible for surgery without compromising long-term results.
Non-randomized controlled trial	For patients with inoperable disease, chemoradiotherapy can produce relatively good long-term results. The combined approach without surgery can permit laryngeal preservation in a useful fraction of patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Ten-year survival with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	Background: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the pharyngoesophageal junction (PEJ) with concomitant involvement of both the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus occurs rarely and poses a challenge in treatment.
Case series	Data regarding the long-term result of aggressive surgical management was lacking. Methods: Forty-one consecutive patients were treated with total pharyngolaryngo-esophagectomy (PLE) and reconstruction between 1984 and 2002.
Case series	The clinicopathological parameters and prognostic data were analyzed. Results: The surgery carried a postoperative mortality rate of 9. 8%. The overall median survival was 18. 5 months, with a 31. 5% 5-year survival rate.
Case series	By multivariate analysis, patients with major tumor localization in the hypopharynx had significantly favorable prognosis (median survivals for hypopharyngeal versus esophageal localization, 37. 2 versus 7. 1 months, P = 0. 043).
Case series	The administration of adjuvant radiotherapy and tumor size less than 5 cm also contributed to a better outcome (P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 037, respectively).
Case series	Conclusions: An aggressive surgical approach with total PLE in conjunction with adjuvant radiotherapy represents a feasible option for treatment of advanced SCC simultaneously involving the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus, given the major tumor localization in the hypopharynx.
Case series	On the other hand, radical surgery for those with major esophageal localization or with tumor size larger than 5 cm yielded ominous results and warrants further justification.
Case series	A reappraisal of surgical management for squamous cell carcinoma in the pharyngoesophageal junction
Cohort study	Forty-seven patients with malignancy of the cervical oesophagus are described and compared with a group of 647 patients with hypopharyngeal malignancy.
Cohort study	There was a higher proportion of non-squamous malignancy in cervical oesophageal cancer compared with hypopharyngeal cancer.
Cohort study	Cervical oesophageal malignancy tended to present earlier with significantly lower T stage and neck node metastases were relatively unusual at presentation.
Cohort study	Patients with cervical oesophageal malignancy were frequently incurable at the time they are first seen and 21 had palliative treatment only, 26 patients had curative treatment, 12 underwent radical radiotherapy and 14 had surgery.
Cohort study	Cervical oesophageal malignancy had a significantly worse prognosis than hypopharyngeal malignancy with an 18% 3 year survival compared with a 33% 3 year survival (chi (1)2 = 7. 1089, P < 0. 01).
Cohort study	Those patients with oesophageal malignancy who were treated fared considerably better than the whole group with 30% being alive at 3 years (chi (1)2 = 10. 5185, P < 0. 01).
Cohort study	Malignant tumours of the cervical oesophagus
Case series	The efficacy and toxicity of combined radiochemotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the cervical oesophagus was evaluated retrospectively.
Case series	Induction chemotherapy consisted of three courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, etoposide and cisplatin (FLEP) or two courses weekly six times of 5-FU and leucovorin combined with biweekly cisplatin.
Case series	This induction regimen was followed by high-dose external beam radiotherapy up to 60-66 Gy and concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. Median follow-up of the recruited 17 patients was 37 months (13-73 months).
Case series	Long-term survival was 24% at 2 and 3 years. The probabilities of locoregional tumour recurrences and distant metastases as sites of first relapse were 67 and 39% at 2 years. Acute and late toxicity of this schedule was moderate.
Case series	The protocol offers a definitive chance of long-term survival for patients with locally advanced carcinomas of the cervical oesophagus, but local in-field recurrences remain the predominant risk after treatment.
Case series	Intensification of the regimen seems possible because no dose-limiting late toxicities were observed.
Case series	Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose radiotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical oesophagus
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objective: To review the experience of 2 institutions in the management of localized carcinoma of the cervical esophagus with chemoradiation therapy. Design: A series of 34 patients received chemoradiation therapy for a 5-year period.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All patients were treated with curative intent. Three different regimens were used, all involving concomitant chemotherapy and high-dose radiation therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Data relating to toxic effects, local control of disease, and disease-free and overall survival were prospectively collected.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Setting: Two combined clinics at separate major hospitals where multidisciplinary care is the standard practice for this disease. Patients: Patients with biopsy-proved carcinoma of the cervical esophagus.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Patients received 3 different chemotherapy regimens. Two of the regimens used a combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The high-dose cisplatin regimen was a large dose of cisplatin (80 mg/m2) given on days 1 and 22 followed by a 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m2) from days 2 to 5 and from days 23 to 26.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The low-dose cisplatin regimen was cisplatin, 20 mg/m2, from days 1 to 5 and from days 22 to 26 and the same 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil. The third regimen used fluorouracil alone. The mean radiation dose administered was 61. 2 Gy in 29.
Non-randomized controlled trial	6 fractions during 41. 8 days using 4- or 6-mV photons and a shrinking field technique. Results: The results of treatment have shown a high rate of local control, although some patients developed metastases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The local complete response rate following treatment was 91%, and the rate of local control of disease was 88%. The projected actuarial 5-year survival rate was 55%. Death from other causes was common.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The acute toxic effects of the treatment were acceptable, with only 5 patients requiring nasogastric feeding or gavage. Two patients died of complications related to strictures.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Concomitant chemoradiation therapy, should be the treatment of choice for carcinoma of the cervical esophagus.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thirty-four patients with carcinoma of the cervical esophagus treated with chemoradiation therapy
Cohort study	Purpose: To determine whether a change in treatment policy to conformal, elective nodal radiotherapy and concurrent high-dose cisplatin improved survival for cervical esophageal cancer patients.
Cohort study	Methods and materials: All cervical esophageal cancer patients treated between 1997 and 2005 were restaged (1983 American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria).
Cohort study	Patients treated before 2001 (previous cohort [PC]) were compared with those treated from 2001 onward (recent cohort [RC]).
Cohort study	The PC institutional chemoradiotherapy protocol was 54 Gy in 20 fractions within 4 weeks, with 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m(2)) on Days 1-4 and either mitomycin C (10 mg/m(2)) or cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) on Day 1.
Cohort study	The RC institutional chemoradiotherapy protocol was conformal radiotherapy, 70 Gy in 35 fractions within 7 weeks, to the primary tumor and elective nodes, with high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) on Days 1, 22, and 43.
Cohort study	Results: The median follow-up was 3. 1 years (PC, 8. 1 and RC, 2. 3). Of 71 patients (25 women and 46 men), 21 of 29 in the PC and 29 of 42 in the RC were treated curatively (curative subgroup, n = 50).
Cohort study	Between the two groups, no differences in overall survival or locoregional relapse-free survival were seen.
Cohort study	The overall survival rate at 2 and 5 years was 35% (range, 24-47%) and 21% (range, 12-32%) in the whole group and 46% (range 32-60%) and 28% (range, 15-42%) in the curative group, respectively.
Cohort study	In the curative group, no statistically significant prognostic factors were found. Trends toward better locoregional relapse-free survival were seen in women (2-year rate, 73% vs. for men, 36%; p = 0.
Cohort study	08) and in patients aged >64 years (2-year rate, 68% vs. age < or =64 years, 34%; p = 0. 10).
Cohort study	Conclusion: No survival improvement could be demonstrated after changing the treatment policy to high-dose cisplatin-based, conventionally fractionated conformal chemoradiotherapy. Female gender and older age might predict for better outcomes.
Cohort study	Effect of concurrent high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy and conformal radiotherapy on cervical esophageal cancer survival
Cohort study	Background: Pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy (PLE) has been regarded as a standard treatment for cervical esophageal cancer, but the morbidity and mortality rates associated with PLE are substantial.
Cohort study	Chemoradiation (CTRT) is widely used to treat esophageal cancer; however, its role in managing cervical esophageal cancer has not been fully elucidated. It was hypothesized that up-front CTRT could be an effective alternative treatment option to PLE.
Cohort study	The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with cervical esophageal cancer treated with these two methods. Methods: Patients with cervical esophageal cancer from 1995 to 2008 were studied.
Cohort study	Three main groups were identified: those treated with PLE, those managed with up-front concurrent chemoradiation, and those not suitable for either PLE or chemoradiation but to whom palliative treatment was offered.
Cohort study	The demographics, management strategies, and outcomes of these patients were studied and analyzed. Results: A total of 107 patients were studied: 87 (81. 3%) were men, and the median age was 64 years (range 17-92 years).
Cohort study	There were 62 patients who underwent PLE as the primary treatment, 21 had up-front chemoradiation, and the others had palliative treatment. In the PLE group, curative resection was achieved in 37 (59.
Cohort study	7%) patients, 20 of whom had either adjuvant chemoradiation or radiotherapy. The hospital mortality rate was 7. 1%. In the chemoradiation group, 10 (47. 6%) had tumor down-staging, 6 of whom achieved a clinically complete response.
Cohort study	Among the 11 patients with poor response, 5 required salvage PLE for palliation.
Cohort study	Chemoradiation-associated morbidities included oral mucositis, bilateral vocal cord palsy, esophageal stricture, carotid artery blowout, and permanent hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism.
Cohort study	The median survival durations of patients in the PLE and chemoradiation groups were 20 and 25 months respectively (P = 0. 39). Conclusions: Up-front chemoradiation can be an alternative therapeutic strategy to PLE.
Cohort study	However, this method is not without drawbacks. A significant proportion also requires salvage surgery.
Cohort study	Both PLE and chemoradiation have significant curative as well as palliative role in the management of cervical esophageal cancer and treatment should be individualized.
Cohort study	Current management of cervical esophageal cancer
Cohort study	Importance: The management of cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) is controversial. The advantages of radiotherapy (RT) for CEC are lower rates of acute morbidity and mortality compared with surgery and potential for larynx preservation.
Cohort study	The advantage of surgery is that the transposed stomach may function better over the long term than an irradiated esophagus, which tends to become stenotic over time.
Cohort study	Which one is the primary treatment of CEC? Objective: To evaluate treatment outcomes of primary RT and primary surgery in patients with CEC.
Cohort study	Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective study conducted in a university hospital included 224 patients treated for CEC between 2001 and 2012.
Cohort study	Interventions: One hundred and sixty-one patients who received primary RT with or without subsequent surgery were assigned to the RT group, including 133 patients who received RT alone or RT with concurrent chemotherapy and 28 patients who received preoperative RT plus surgery.
Cohort study	Sixty-three patients who received primary surgery with or without subsequent RT were assigned to the primary surgery group, including 27 patients who received surgery alone and 36 patients who received surgery plus postoperative RT.
Cohort study	Main outcomes and measures: The rates of overall 2-year local failure-free survival (FFS), regional FFS, distant FFS, and overall survival for patients undergoing primary RT and primary surgery were compared.
Cohort study	A separate analysis using matched cases between the primary RT group and primary surgery group was conducted. Results: The median follow-up time was 15. 1 months.
Cohort study	The rates of overall 2-year local FFS, regional FFS, distant FFS, and overall survival for patients undergoing primary RT and primary surgery were 69. 9% and 68. 6%, 79. 5% and 69. 8%, 74. 3% and 62. 5%, 49. 3% and 50. 7%, respectively (P >.
Cohort study	05 for all). Matched-case analyses did not show any significant differences in measured survival rates between the treatment groups.
Cohort study	Conclusions and relevance: Given the similarities in rates of local FFS, regional FFS, distant FFS, and overall survival between the primary RT and primary surgery CEC treatment groups, we recommend primary RT for larynx preservation, with surgery offered subsequently for patients who do not respond to RT.
Cohort study	Primary radiotherapy compared with primary surgery in cervical esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: The role of contemporary radiotherapy (RT) has not yet been elucidated, mainly because of the low incidence of cervical esophageal cancer.
Case series	The purpose of this study was to analyze the outcome in patients with cervical esophageal cancer treated with definitive RT.
Case series	Methods: A total of 115 patients with cervical esophageal cancer treated with definitive RT during January 2001 through April 2012 in our center were analyzed.
Case series	Eighty patients received RT alone and 35 patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin administered either weekly (30 mg/m2) or every 3 weeks (80 mg/m2). Results: The median follow-up time was 17. 1 months.
Case series	For all patients, the overall 2-year local failure-free survival (LFFS), regional failure-free survival (RFFS), distant failure-free survival (DFFS), and overall survival (OS) rate was 68. 3%, 83. 3%, 75. 7%, and 47. 6%, respectively.
Case series	Conclusion: Definitive RT accomplished a satisfactory local control rate and contributed to organ preservation for patients with cervical esophageal cancer. 2015.
Case series	Definitive radiotherapy for cervical esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Data on cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) based on modern radiotherapy technique are rare. We aimed to analyze the clinical efficacy and failure pattern of patients with CEC who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Methods: Between February 2002 and October 2013, 102 patients with CEC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed.
Case series	All patients received concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy with conformal radiotherapy (50-70 Gy in 25-35 fractions, 5 fractions per week over 5-7 weeks).
Case series	Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and loco-regional failure-free survival (LRFFS) were calculated. Results: The 3-year OS, PFS and LRFFS rates for the entire sample were 39. 3%, 33. 6% and 35. 3%, respectively.
Case series	During follow-up, 32, 26, and 41 patients had developed local, regional, and distant failure, respectively. Sex and hoarseness were independent prognostic indicators for OS (P=0. 011, P<0. 001; respectively) and PFS (P=0. 008, P=0. 001; respectively).
Case series	Hoarseness was the only independent prognostic factor for LRFFS (P=0. 002). Conclusions: Distant metastasis was the most common failure pattern in CEC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Hoarseness was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, and LRFFS.
Case series	Clinical efficacy and failure pattern in patients with cervical esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy
Cohort study	Background: Few studies have examined optimal treatment specifically for cervical esophageal carcinoma. This study evaluated the outcome of three common treatment strategies with a focus on the debated role of surgery.
Cohort study	Methods: All patients with cervical esophageal cancer treated at a single center were identified and their outcomes analyzed in terms of morbidity, mortality, and recurrence according to the treatment they received, i. e.
Cohort study	surgery alone, definitive platinum-based chemoradiation (CRT), or CRT followed by surgery. Results: The study population included 148 patients with cervical esophageal cancer from a prospective database of 3445 patients.
Cohort study	Primary surgery was the treatment of choice for 56 (37. 83%) patients, definitive CRT was the treatment of choice for 52 (35. 13%) patients, and CRT followed by surgery was the treatment of choice for 40 (27. 02%) patients.
Cohort study	CRT-treated patients obtained 36. 96% complete clinical response, with overall morbidity and mortality rates of 36. 95 and 2. 17%, respectively. Surgical complete resection was achieved in 71.
Cohort study	88% of surgically treated cases, with morbidity and mortality rates of 52. 17 and 6. 25%, respectively.
Cohort study	No significant survival difference existed among the three treatments, but patients who underwent surgery alone had a significantly lower stage of disease (p = 0. 031).
Cohort study	Compared with patients with complete response after CRT, surgery did not confer any significant survival benefit, and overall 5-year survival was lower than definitive CRT alone.
Cohort study	In contrast, surgery improved survival significantly in patients with non-complete response after definitive CRT (p = 0. 023). Conclusions: Definitive platinum-based CRT should be the treatment of choice for cervical esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Surgery has a role for patients with non-complete response as it adds significant survival benefit, with acceptable morbidity and mortality.
Cohort study	Cervical Esophageal Cancer Treatment Strategies: A Cohort Study Appraising the Debated Role of Surgery
meta analysis	Esophageal cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although patients often present with apparently resectable disease, systemic spread frequently occurs before the development of symptoms and detection of tumor.
meta analysis	The use of combined chemoradiation therapy, particularly before resection, appears to prolong survival and increase cure rates in certain histologic subtypes.
meta analysis	Four randomized phase III trials compared preoperative chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with surgery alone.
meta analysis	In trials including only patients with squamous histology, no improvement in survival was observed with preoperative chemoradiation therapy; however, in a trial including only patients with adenocarcinoma histology, improved median and overall survival were observed.
meta analysis	Paclitaxel has been evaluated as a single agent in a phase II trial in previously untreated patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer; the overall response rate was 32% and median survival was 13. 2 months.
meta analysis	Paclitaxel-based combinations also have been evaluated in esophageal cancer; particularly encouraging preliminary results have been achieved with paclitaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil.
meta analysis	Because paclitaxel is a potent radiosensitizer, it also has been evaluated in combination with radiation therapy for esophageal and other thoracic cancers, alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
meta analysis	Preliminary results suggest that neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxel-based combinations (including 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) and radiation is highly active, with variable toxicity.
meta analysis	A goal of future trials is to assess paclitaxel-based combined modality therapy in combination with other new chemotherapeutic agents.
meta analysis	Concurrent paclitaxel and thoracic irradiation for locally advanced esophageal cancer
review	Esophageal cancer is a virulent malignancy associated with a 5-year overall survival of approximately 5%.
review	Treatment remains controversial-despite the results of prospective, randomized trials of combined-modality therapy-because results are poor with all strategies. The role of surgical resection in patients with esophageal cancer is controversial.
review	The fact that most patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis makes surgery futile in the majority of cases.
review	Nevertheless, surgery is the best option for cure in early-stage esophageal cancer and remains the superior modality for local control in locally advanced disease. The benefits and drawbacks of several surgical approaches are discussed in this review.
review	Multiple factors are implicated in the etiology of postesophagectomy complications, the rate of which is quite high. Perhaps the most important contributor to morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy is the development of pulmonary complications.
review	Over the past decade, there has been a trend toward the increased use of trimodality therapy in potentially operable patients-induction chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by surgery.
review	The rationale for using induction therapy is that it allows simultaneous delivery of local (radiation therapy) and systemic (chemotherapy) modalities, provides for early tumor regression and symptom control, results in improved subsequent local control, and identifies responding patients who might benefit from adjuvant therapy.
review	Thus, on the basis of recent studies and meta-analyses, there may be a modest survival advantage for patients who receive induction chemotherapy followed by surgery, compared with surgery alone.
review	There is also an apparent increase in treatment-related mortality, mainly for patients receiving induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
review	Currently, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines support the use of induction therapy only in established clinical trial protocols.
review	Outcomes after surgery for esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy is the mainstay of curative treatment for localized esophageal cancer. However, what constitutes cure is not well defined.
Case series	This study was undertaken to characterize actual 5-year survivors following esophagectomy and to determine prognostic factors for disease-specific survival (DSS) from 60 months.
Case series	Materials and methods: Between 1987 and 2004, 398 consecutive patients underwent esophagectomy and had potential for 5 years follow-up. Clinicopathological factors associated with DSS from 5 years onward were analyzed.
Case series	Results: Median DSS was 25 months. Neoadjuvant therapy was administered to 159 of 398 (40%). There were 114 of 398 (29%) actual 5-year survivors.
Case series	On multivariate analysis, 5-year survivors were significantly more likely to have lower T classification, N classification, and R0 resections compared with patients who died less than 5 years after surgery.
Case series	There were 66 of 398 patients (17%) with positive margins, and 6 of these were 5-year survivors. Of the 114 5-year survivors, 17 (15%) subsequently died of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Prognostic factors for DSS after surviving 5 years were age and T classification for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy and surgery alone, respectively.
Case series	Powerful prognostic factors from time of treatment, including nodal status, were no longer prognostic factors after surviving to 5 years. Conclusions: No single clinicopathological variable negated survival to 5 years.
Case series	Prognostication once surviving 5 years is difficult. The majority of 5-year survivors can be considered cured of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Defining cure for esophageal cancer: analysis of actual 5-year survivors following esophagectomy
review	Surgical resection has been traditionally the mainstay of treatment for localized esophageal cancers. However, survival after surgery alone for advanced esophageal cancer is not satisfactory.
review	In Japan, the development of multimodal therapy for esophageal cancers has centered mainly on systemic chemotherapy plus surgery to control distant metastasis.
review	Based on the results of the recent Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) 9907 study, preoperative chemotherapy (consisting of 5-FU and cisplatin) followed by surgery has emerged as the standard treatment.
review	In Western countries, where chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery has been mainly explored for patients with resectable esophageal cancers, two large controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy reported conflicting results.
review	However, a recent meta-analysis reported significant survival benefits for preoperative chemotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
review	We need to find new effective preoperative chemotherapeutic regimens, including molecular target agents, with response rates higher than that of the conventional chemotherapy of 5-FU and cisplatin.
review	However, we also must compare the survival benefits of preoperative chemotherapy with preoperative chemoradiotherapy.
review	Multimodal treatment for resectable esophageal cancer
review	The patterns of esophageal cancer are dramatically changing in the United States. Three decades ago the large majority of these cancers were squamous cell carcinomas, but the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been steadily increasing.
review	By the early 1990s, adenocarcinoma had become the most common cell type of esophageal cancer among white patients, although squamous cell cancers still predominated among black patients.
review	The trends are not simply due to gastric cardia cancers now being called esophageal adenocarcinomas, because the rates of tumors appearing just below the esophageal-gastric junction are also increasing.
review	Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the primary causes of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus. The causes of esophageal adenocarcinoma are not well known; thus, reasons for the increasing incidence are not clear.
review	Tobacco smoking has now been established as a risk factor, but there appears to be little link to alcohol consumption. One of the strongest emerging risk factors, however, is obesity.
review	Increases in the prevalence of obesity and the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma are parallel, and several epidemiologic studies have shown upwards of threefold excess risks among overweight individuals.
review	Further research into the causes of these usually fatal cancers may help identify other potential determinants and provide needed information to help stem their increase.
review	The changing epidemiology of esophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: The aim of this study is to provide a contemporary quantitative analysis of the existing literature examining the relationship between surgical caseload and outcome following esophageal resection.
meta analysis	Methods: Medline, Embase, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists were searched for trials comparing clinical outcome following esophagectomy from high- and low-volume hospitals since 2000.
meta analysis	Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and post-operative complications.
meta analysis	Results: Nine appropriate publications comprising 27,843 esophagectomy operations were included, 12,130 and 15,713 operations were performed in low- and high-volume surgical units, respectively.
meta analysis	Esophagectomy at low-volume hospitals was associated with a significant increase in incidence of in-hospital (8. 48% vs. 2. 82%; pooled odds ratio (POR) = 0. 29; P < 0. 0001) and 30-day mortality (2. 09% vs. 0. 73%; POR = 0. 31; P < 0. 0001).
meta analysis	There was insufficient data for conclusive statistical analysis of length of hospital stay or post-operative complications.
meta analysis	Conclusions: This meta-analysis does suggest a benefit in the centralization of esophageal cancer surgery to high-volume institutions with respect to mortality.
meta analysis	The outcomes of this study are of interest to patients, healthcare providers and payers, particularly regarding service reconfiguration and more specifically centralization of services.
meta analysis	Future studies that look at long-term survival will help improve understanding of any late consequences such as survival and quality of life following esophageal surgery at low- and high-volume hospitals.
meta analysis	Volume-outcome relationship in surgery for esophageal malignancy: systematic review and meta-analysis 2000-2011
review	Loco-regionally advanced esophageal cancer is a lethal disease with poor outcomes despite aggressive multimodality therapy. The appropriate management of these patients is contentious and no single standard of care has been defined.
review	Literature suggests that preoperative chemoradiotherapy may be superior to preoperative chemotherapy. Recently, several developments have impacted the care of these patients.
review	The 2010 AJCC TNM staging system now recognizes the biologic heterogeneity of the disease and stages adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma separately.
review	Studies suggest potentially less toxic chemotherapeutic agents including oxaliplatin may be useful in the management of this disease. FDG-PET imaging appears to have prognostic value and may predict for pathologic response.
review	In addition, several trials have explored inhibition of the ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 (Her2) receptors.
review	The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab appears to extend survival for patients with metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and is under investigation for use in patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.
review	Current developments in the management of locally advanced esophageal cancer
review	The management of localized esophageal cancer has traditionally been surgical resection; yet, despite improvements in outcomes and techniques, survival for patients with esophageal cancer, especially those with evidence of nodal involvement, remains poor.
review	In this article, we have used an evidence-based approach to define optimal therapy based on clinical stage for esophageal cancer.
review	We review the currently available evidence supporting the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies for locally advanced esophageal cancer.
review	Additionally, we review the evidence supporting the role of endoscopic therapies, rather than resection, for early-stage esophageal cancer.
review	Evidence-based review of the management of cancers of the gastroesophageal junction
Cross-sectional study	Background: Incidence rates for esophageal adenocarcinoma previously were reported to be increasing rapidly, especially among white males. Rates for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma also were observed to be rising, although less rapidly.
Cross-sectional study	In this article, the authors update the incidence trends through 1994 and further consider the trends by age group.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data were used to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates for esophageal carcinoma by histologic type and gastric adenocarcinoma by anatomic subsite.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Among white males, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus rose > 350% since the mid-1970s, surpassing squamous cell carcinoma around 1990. Rates also rose among black males, but remained at much lower levels.
Cross-sectional study	To a lesser extent, there were continuing increases in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma among white and black males, which nearly equaled the rates for noncardia tumors of the stomach in white men.
Cross-sectional study	The upward trend for both tumors was much greater among older than younger men. Although the incidence also rose among females, rates remained much lower than among males.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Previously reported increases of esophageal adenocarcinoma are continuing, most notably among white males.
Cross-sectional study	Cigarette smoking may contribute to the trend through an early stage carcinogenic effect, along with obesity, which may increase intraabdominal pressure and predispose to gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Cross-sectional study	Further research into esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is needed to clarify the risk factors and mechanisms responsible for the upward trends as well as the racial and gender disparities in incidence.

review	Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) is a well-established treatment for esophageal cancer, but disease recurrence is common and many patients do not achieve initial remission with CRT alone.
review	Predictors of outcome with CRT are needed to guide prognosis and further treatment decisions, in particular the need for post-CRT surgery.
review	We review the role of baseline clinical factors, such as histology and tumor bulk, in predicting response to CRT.
review	Post-CRT assessments, particularly PET imaging, may provide further information about the likelihood of complete response and survival, but the predictive power of clinical assessments remains limited.
review	Emerging research on biomarkers holds promise for more tailored and accurate prediction of outcome with definitive CRT.
review	Clinical tools to predict outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation: are we there yet?
Case series	Background: Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer is associated with improved outcomes.
Case series	We evaluated whether a nomogram designed to predict who would have a pCR after trimodality therapy could also predict outcome after definitive chemoradiation.
Case series	Methods: Patients in this retrospective, single-institution analysis had received chemoradiation without surgery for esophageal cancer from 1998 through 2010; 333 such patients had complete information on all variables required for the pCR nomogram: sex; T status (by endoscopic sonography); tumor grade; tumor avidity on positron emission tomography (PET); and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)-directed biopsy results after chemoradiation.
Case series	We used multivariate Cox regression to test potential associations between clinical outcomes [overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence, and distant metastasis] and patient or treatment factors and the pCR nomogram score; the component variables of the nomogram were not reintroduced into the multivariate analysis.
Case series	Results: The median follow-up time for all patients (median age 66 years) was 18. 2 months (30. 7 months for those alive at the time of analysis).
Case series	Patients with nomogram scores ≤125 (median for all patients) had significantly worse outcomes than patients with scores >125: median OS time 19. 7 vs. 48. 2 months; disease-free survival (DFS) time 6. 1 vs. 31.
Case series	1 months; locoregional failure-free survival time 17. 7 months vs. not reached; and distant metastasis-free survival time 11. 7 months vs. not reached (all P<0. 001).
Case series	Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that nomogram score independently predicted each survival outcome, along with other patient and disease factors.
Case series	Conclusions: The pCR nomogram score predicted survival outcomes in patients receiving definitive chemoradiation for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Although this nomogram requires further validation, it may prove useful for stratifying patients for clinical trials designed to intensify treatments for patients at the highest risk of relapse.
Case series	A nomogram that predicts pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation also predicts survival outcomes after definitive chemoradiation for esophageal cancer
Cohort study	Background: After neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CXRT) for esophageal cancer, surgery has traditionally been recommended to be performed within 8 weeks. However, surgery is often delayed for various reasons.
Cohort study	Data from other cancers suggest that delaying surgery may increase the pathologic complete response rate. However, there are theoretical concerns that waiting longer after radiation may lead to a more difficult operation and more complications.
Cohort study	The optimal timing of esophagectomy after CXRT is unknown. Methods: From a prospective database, we analyzed 266 patients with resected esophageal cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant CXRT from 2002 to 2008.
Cohort study	Salvage resections were excluded from this analysis. We compared patients who had surgery within 8 weeks of CXRT and those who had surgery after 8 weeks.
Cohort study	We used multivariable analysis to determine whether increased interval between chemoradiation and surgery was independently associated with perioperative complication, pathologic response, or overall survival.
Cohort study	Results: One hundred fifty patients were resected within 8 weeks and 116 were resected greater than 8 weeks after completing CXRT.
Cohort study	Mean length of operation, intraoperative blood loss, anastomotic leak rate, and perioperative complication rate were similar for the two groups.
Cohort study	Pathologic complete response rate and overall survival were also similar for the two groups (p=not significant).
Cohort study	In multivariable analysis, timing of surgery was not an independent predictor of perioperative complication, pathologic complete response, or overall survival.
Cohort study	Conclusions: The timing of esophagectomy after neoadjuvant CXRT is not associated with perioperative complication, pathologic response, or overall survival.
Cohort study	It may be reasonable to delay esophagectomy beyond 8 weeks for patients who have not yet recovered from chemoradiation.
Cohort study	Does the timing of esophagectomy after chemoradiation affect outcome?
Case series	Importance: Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may be a clinical prognostic marker of superior outcomes. In patients with esophageal cancer, pCR is associated with increased survival.
Case series	While mechanisms for increasing the likelihood of pCR remain unknown, in other solid tumors, higher rates of pCR have been associated with longer time intervals between CRT completion and surgical procedures.
Case series	Objective: To determine the association between time intervals from the completion of CRT to surgical procedure with rates of pCR in patients with esophageal cancer.
Case series	Design, setting, and participants: A prospectively maintained multidisciplinary foregut database was reviewed for consecutively enrolled patients with esophageal cancer from January 2000 to July 2015 presenting for surgical evaluation at a single National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center within a quaternary academic medical center.
Case series	Interventions: Included patients successfully completed neoadjuvant CRT followed by esophagectomy.
Case series	Main outcomes and measures: Rate of pCR by logistic regression based on a categorized time interval (ie, 0 to 42, 43 to 56, 57 to 70, 71 to 84, 85 to 98, and 99 or more days) from the completion of CRT to surgical resection, adjusted for clinical stage, demographic information, and CRT regimen.
Case series	Results: Of the 234 patients who met inclusion criteria, 191 (81. 6%) were male, and the median (range) age was 64 (58-70) years; 206 (88. 0%) were diagnosed as having adenocarcinoma, and 65 (27. 9%) had a pCR.
Case series	Patients in the 85 to 98-day group had significantly increased odds of a pCR compared with other groups (odds ratio, 5. 46; 95% CI, 1. 16-25. 68; P =. 03).
Case series	No significant differences in survival were seen between time groups overall or among patients with residual tumor.
Case series	Conclusions and relevance: This study suggests that a time interval of 85 to 98 days between CRT completion and surgical resection is associated with significantly increased odds of a pCR in patients with esophageal cancer.
Case series	No adverse association with survival was detected as a result of delaying resection, even in patients with residual tumor.
Case series	Association of Intervals Between Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation and Surgical Resection With Pathologic Complete Response and Survival in Patients With Esophageal Cancer
meta analysis	Background: The long-term survival benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and chemoradiotherapy (NACR) for oesophageal carcinoma are well established.
meta analysis	Both are burdened, however, by toxicity that could contribute to perioperative morbidity and mortality.
meta analysis	Methods: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched to capture the incidence of any postoperative complications, cardiac complications, respiratory complications, anastomotic leakage, postoperative 30-day mortality, total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality in randomized clinical trials comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, or NAC versus NACR.
meta analysis	Meta-analyses comparing NAC and NACR were conducted by using adjusted indirect comparison. Results: Twenty-three relevant studies were identified.
meta analysis	Comparing NAC or NACR with surgery alone, there was no increase in morbidity or mortality attributable to neoadjuvant therapy.
meta analysis	Subgroup analysis of NACR for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) suggested an increased risk of total postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality compared with surgery alone: risk ratio 1·95 (95 per cent confidence interval 1·06 to 3·60; P = 0·032) and 1·97 (1·07 to 3·64; P = 0·030) respectively.
meta analysis	A combination of direct comparison and adjusted indirect comparison showed no difference between NACR and NAC regarding morbidity or mortality.
meta analysis	Conclusion: Neither NAC nor NACR for oesophageal carcinoma increases the risk of postoperative morbidity or perioperative mortality compared with surgery alone. There was no clear difference between NAC and NACR.
meta analysis	Care should be taken with NACR in oesophageal SCC, where an increased risk of postoperative mortality and treatment-related mortality was apparent.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis of postoperative morbidity and perioperative mortality in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for resectable oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junctional cancers
Cohort study	Purpose: There is no consensus about the impact of a high BMI on postoperative morbidity and survival after esophagectomy.
Cohort study	The aim of this study was to determine the influence of a high BMI on postoperative complications and survival in a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients.
Cohort study	Methods: From January 2006 to December 2012, 1,342 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups: 950 patients were classified as normal BMI (BMI 18. 5-24.
Cohort study	9 kg/m(2)), 279 were classified as high BMI (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2)), and 113 as low BMI (BMI < 18. 5 kg/m(2)). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify confounding factors associated with postoperative complications.
Cohort study	The impact of BMI on overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: The predominance of pathological type was esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1,280, 95. 4 %).
Cohort study	Overall morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay did not differ among groups. The incidence of pneumonia was higher in patients with high BMI compared with those with normal BMI (14. 7 vs. 9. 9 %, P = 0. 025).
Cohort study	However, chylothorax was less frequent in high-BMI group (0. 4 % in high-BMI group, 3. 1 % in normal group, and 3. 5 % in low group, P = 0. 011).
Cohort study	Logistic regression analysis revealed high BMI was independently associated with decreased incidence of chylothorax [HR 0. 86; 95 % confidence interval 0. 76-0. 97].
Cohort study	Overweight and obese patients had significantly better overall survival than underweight patients (median OS 55. 6 vs. 32. 5 months, P = 0. 013), while the pathological stage was significantly higher in underweight patients (P = 0. 001).
Cohort study	In multivariate analysis, T status, N status, differentiation grade, and tumor length were identified as independent prognostic factors.
Cohort study	Conclusion: A high BMI is not associated with increased overall morbidity following esophagectomy; moreover, it is associated with decreased incidence of chylothorax.
Cohort study	The better overall survival in patients with high BMI compared with those with low BMI might be due to a relatively low pathological stage. A high BMI should therefore not be a relative contraindication for esophagectomy.
Cohort study	A high body mass index in esophageal cancer patients is not associated with adverse outcomes following esophagectomy
randomized controlled trial	Importance: Preserving functional capacity is a key element in the care continuum for patients with esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Prehabilitation, a preoperative conditioning intervention aiming to optimize physical status, has not been tested in upper gastrointestinal surgery to date.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To investigate whether prehabilitation is effective in improving functional status in patients undergoing esophagogastric cancer resection.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: A randomized clinical trial (available-case analysis based on completed assessments) was conducted at McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) comparing prehabilitation with a control group.
randomized controlled trial	Intervention consisted of preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization. Participants were adults awaiting elective esophagogastric resection for cancer. The study dates were February 13, 2013, to February 10, 2017.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was change in functional capacity, measured with absolute change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).
randomized controlled trial	Preoperative (end of the prehabilitation period) and postoperative (from 4 to 8 weeks after surgery) data were compared between groups. Results: Sixty-eight patients were randomized, and 51 were included in the primary analysis.
randomized controlled trial	The control group were a mean (SD) age, 68. 0 (11. 6) years and 20 (80%) men. Patients in the prehabilitation group were a mean (SD) age, 67. 3 (7. 4) years and 18 (69%) men.
randomized controlled trial	Compared with the control group, the prehabilitation group had improved functional capacity both before surgery (mean [SD] 6MWD change, 36. 9 [51. 4] vs -22. 8 [52. 5] m; P <. 001) and after surgery (mean [SD] 6MWD change, 15. 4 [65. 6] vs -81. 8 [87.
randomized controlled trial	0] m; P <. 001). Conclusions and relevance: Prehabilitation improves perioperative functional capacity in esophagogastric surgery.
randomized controlled trial	Keeping patients from physical and nutritional status decline could have a significant effect on the cancer care continuum. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT01666158.

Cohort study	Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) after esophagectomy have been reported to occur in 15. 9-30% of patients and lead to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, prolonged duration of hospital stay, and additional medical costs.
Cohort study	The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the possible prevention of PPCs by intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation in esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy.
Cohort study	The subjects included 100 patients (87 males and 13 females with mean age 66. 5 ± 8. 6 years) who underwent esophagectomy. They were divided into two groups: 63 patients (53 males and 10 females with mean age 67. 4 ± 9.
Cohort study	0 years) in the preoperative rehabilitation (PR) group and 37 patients (34 males and 3 females with mean age 65. 0 ± 7. 8 years) in the non-PR (NPR) group.
Cohort study	The PR group received sufficient preoperative respiratory rehabilitation for >7 days, and the NPR group insufficiently received preoperative respiratory rehabilitation or none at all.
Cohort study	The results of the logistic regression analysis and multivariate analysis to correct for all considerable confounding factors revealed the rates of PPCs of 6. 4% and 24. 3% in the PR group and NPR group, respectively.
Cohort study	The PR group demonstrated a significantly less incidence rate of PPCs than the NPR group (odds ratio: 0. 14, 95% confidential interval: 0. 02~0. 64).
Cohort study	[Correction added after online publication 25 June 2012: confidence interval has been changed from -1. 86~ -0.
Cohort study	22] This study showed that the intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation reduced PPCs in esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy.
Cohort study	Prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications through intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation in patients with esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Surgical resection of the larynx, hypopharynx and cervical esophagus, or pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy (PLE), with pharyngogastric anastomosis (PGA) offers a means of controlling local and regional carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT).
Case series	We reviewed our experience with PLE for carcinoma of the UADT to evaluate functional outcome and survival. Methods: Patients undergoing PLE from 1986 through 1999 were reviewed.
Case series	Survivors completed questionnaires which graded their level of function and voice rehabilitation. Gastric emptying studies were performed with rates compared with normal controls. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Case series	Results: Thirty-one patients underwent PLE during the study period. Twenty-nine patients had squamous cell carcinoma. Operative mortality was 0%. Thirty-day mortality was 9. 6%. There were 2 anastomotic leaks (6. 4%).
Case series	All survivors reported normal ability to complete activities of daily living. Voice rehabilitation was acceptable in 7 of 10 survivors. Positive surgical margins resulted in decreased survival (P = 0. 03).
Case series	No other patient demographic or management variable altered survival. One-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 67%, 40%, and 18%, respectively.
Case series	Conclusion: PLE with PGA for carcinoma of the UADT may be performed with low morbidity and mortality. Functional patient outcomes including gastric emptying, activities of daily living, and voice rehabilitation are acceptable.
Case series	Functional outcome and survival after pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy for cancer
Case series	Background: Free jejunal transfer has become the standard technique for reconstruction of the pharynx and hypopharynx, especially with proximal neoplastic lesions, whereas gastric tube interposition is the technique of choice for reconstruction of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus when resection extends below the thoracic inlet.
Case series	Hypothesis: Surgical ablation is a viable option for advanced hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal neoplasms, with stomach interposition a safe and preferred method of reconstruction. Design: Retrospective analysis.
Case series	Setting: University hospital that is a regional referral institution for esophageal cancer treatment and complex digestive reconstructions after esophagectomy.
Case series	Patients: We reviewed the records of 209 patients who underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy between May 1982 and July 1999. The majority of patients had advanced cancer: hypopharyngeal in 131 cases and cervical esophageal in 78 cases.
Case series	Interventions: Pharyngolaryngectomy and total esophagectomy with pharyngogastric anastomoses (n = 127); pharyngolaryngectomy, cervical esophagectomy, and reconstruction with free jejunal transplant (n = 77); and pharyngolaryngectomy and total esophagectomy with pharyngocolic anastomoses (n = 5).
Case series	Main outcome measures: Postoperative mortality and morbidity, long-term survival, and prognostic factors influencing survival. Results: The postoperative in-hospital mortality rate was 4. 8% (10 patients), with a postoperative morbidity rate of 38.
Case series	3%. Alimentary continuity was achieved using the stomach (127 patients), colon (5 patients), or free jejunal autograft (77 patients). The 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 62% and 24%, respectively.
Case series	There was no significant difference with regard to the survival between gastric transposition and free jejunal autograft, but there were fewer complications in the gastric pull-up group (33% vs 47%, P<. 05).
Case series	The significant adverse factors affecting survival were tumor cervical localization, postoperative complications, disease stages pT3 and pT4 for the cervical esophageal tumors, microscopic pharyngeal penetration, or incomplete resection.
Case series	The significant beneficial factors were tumor hypopharyngeal localization and postoperative radiotherapy.
Case series	Conclusions: Surgical ablation is a viable option for advanced hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal neoplasms, with stomach interposition the preferred method of reconstruction.
Case series	Although the prognosis is poor, satisfactory short-term palliation can be achieved. The significant adverse factors affecting survival should be taken into account to select the candidates for surgery.
Case series	Surgical management of carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus: analysis of 209 cases
Case series	Background: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the pharyngoesophageal junction (PEJ) with concomitant involvement of both the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus occurs rarely and poses a challenge in treatment.
Case series	Data regarding the long-term result of aggressive surgical management was lacking. Methods: Forty-one consecutive patients were treated with total pharyngolaryngo-esophagectomy (PLE) and reconstruction between 1984 and 2002.
Case series	The clinicopathological parameters and prognostic data were analyzed. Results: The surgery carried a postoperative mortality rate of 9. 8%. The overall median survival was 18. 5 months, with a 31. 5% 5-year survival rate.
Case series	By multivariate analysis, patients with major tumor localization in the hypopharynx had significantly favorable prognosis (median survivals for hypopharyngeal versus esophageal localization, 37. 2 versus 7. 1 months, P = 0. 043).
Case series	The administration of adjuvant radiotherapy and tumor size less than 5 cm also contributed to a better outcome (P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 037, respectively).
Case series	Conclusions: An aggressive surgical approach with total PLE in conjunction with adjuvant radiotherapy represents a feasible option for treatment of advanced SCC simultaneously involving the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus, given the major tumor localization in the hypopharynx.
Case series	On the other hand, radical surgery for those with major esophageal localization or with tumor size larger than 5 cm yielded ominous results and warrants further justification.
Case series	A reappraisal of surgical management for squamous cell carcinoma in the pharyngoesophageal junction
review	Hypopharynx and cervical esophagus represent a critical location for a squamous cell carcinoma, a neoplasm that usually requires extensive surgery.
review	Although morbidity and mortality of resection have markedly decreased over the past decade, the major issue in these patients remains quality of life owing to the need for combination with a laryngectomy to provide radical treatment.
review	Chemoradiation therapy has the potential to downstage and even cure the disease without altering quality of life dramatically.
review	Today, in the absence of randomized trials, the choice between surgery and definitive chemoradiotherapy should be based on clear information and the patient's preference. Salvage surgery is feasible and effective in selected patients.
review	Current status of surgery for carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus
Case series	Objective: We studied optimum surgery for carcinoma of the cervical esophagus extending to the thoracic esophagus (Ce-Ut carcinoma).
Case series	Methods: Subjects were 13 patients diagnosed with Ce-Ut carcinoma treated at our institute from January 1989 to December 1998.
Case series	Clinicopathologic information such as surgical procedures, pathologic findings, and postoperative complications were analyzed. Results: In 10, laryngoesophagectomy was conducted due to tracheal invasion by the tumor.
Case series	In 7, mediastinal tracheostomy was done because of the extended resection of the proximal trachea. In 3, the larynx was preserved and, in 2, cricopharyngeal myotomy was added.
Case series	Lymph node metastasis was found only in the neck and the upper mediastinum at surgery and recurrences were all lung metastasis. The incidence of postoperative complications was very high (76.
Case series	9%), and 1 patient died due to widespread tracheal necrosis. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for the group was 33.
Case series	3% and that for the 9 curative cases was 50%, but most of the cases who underwent noncurative resection and/or who received preoperative therapy for widespread invasion to surrounding organs died within a year.
Case series	Conclusion: The prognosis of patients who undergoing curative extended resection of the proximal trachea and suitable lymph node dissection in the neck and upper mediastinum may improve, and larynx-preserving surgery is recommended for patients without tracheal invasion.
Case series	Despite preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the prognosis of patients with widespread invasion to surrounding organs was very poor, and clinical studies on new therapeutic strategies for these advanced cases are needed to improve the prognosis of Ce-Ut carcinoma patients.
Case series	A clinical study of surgical treatment of patients with carcinoma of the cervical esophagus extending to the thoracic esophagus
Cohort study	Objectives: To clarify the efficacy of dissection of retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RPLNs) in the surgical treatment of carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus.
Cohort study	Study design: We started planned dissection of the RPLN during initial radical surgery in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx or the cervical esophagus in 1988.
Cohort study	Until 1997, we performed this procedure as a standard operation in 82 consecutive patients.
Cohort study	Methods: Mortality resulting from RPLN metastasis was compared between 82 patients who underwent RPLN dissection and 69 patients who did not undergo the procedure. Results: Of 82 patients, 16 patients (20%) had positive RPLNs.
Cohort study	These patients were at high risk of recurrence unless the node(s) were dissected. Although RPLN dissection did not improve the cumulative 5-year survival rate, it significantly decreased the number of patients who died of RPLN metastasis (chi2 = 3.
Cohort study	68, P <. 1). Four of the 16 patients who had positive RPLNs survived without any recurrence.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Bilateral dissection of the RPLN during initial surgery is highly recommended in every surgical case of carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus.
Cohort study	Significance of retropharyngeal node dissection at radical surgery for carcinoma of the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus
Case series	Background: The survival of patients with carcinoma of the cervical esophagus remains poor in spite of multimodality treatment and technical improvements in surgical resection and reconstruction.
Case series	This study was undertaken to update our experience with cervical esophageal carcinoma and to identify factors that had an impact on patient survival and quality of life.
Case series	Patients and methods: Clinical data encompassing 132 variables were collected on 67 patients with cervical esophageal carcinoma from 1980 to 1993.
Case series	Statistical analysis was performed: independent Student's t-tests, Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, and log rank analyses were used in the statistical evaluation. The mean age of the patients was 63 years (range 31 to 88).
Case series	Dysphagia was the primary symptom in 86% of patients; 80% had received no prior treatment. The most common abnormal finding (21%) on physical examination was a neck mass.
Case series	Results: Curative resection was performed in 22 patients, 7 had palliative procedures, and 7 were found to be inoperable at exploration and received palliative treatment.
Case series	Radiation with or without chemotherapy was definitive treatment for 10 patients, whereas 4 patients were treated with chemotherapy alone for cure, and 17 patients received palliative treatment.
Case series	The mean survival following diagnosis was 17 months (range 1 to 96). Cumulative 5-year survival was 12%.
Case series	Conclusions: Persistent disease, chemotherapy prior to presentation, and chemotherapy for cure remained as statistically significant parameters associated with decreased survival by multivariate analysis.
Case series	There was a trend toward improved survival in patients treated with surgical resection.
Case series	Impact of clinicopathologic parameters on patient survival in carcinoma of the cervical esophagus
Case series	Objectives: The aim of the present study was to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics, reconstruction methods after resection, and prognosis of cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Case series	Methods: Seventy-four with squamous cell carcinomas of the cervical esophagus not previously treated who underwent cervical esophagectomy or total esophagectomy with or without laryngectomy were retrospectively analyzed.
Case series	Results: The operative morbidity and in-hospital mortality rates were 34% (25 patients) and 4% (3 patients), respectively.
Case series	Alimentary continuity was achieved with free jejunal transfer (50 patients), gastric pull-up (19 patients), and other procedures (5 patients).
Case series	The frequencies of postoperative complications and death did not differ between free jejunal transfer and gastric pull-up. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates were 42% and 33%, respectively.
Case series	The significant clinicopathological factors affecting survival were patient gender, high T factor, lymph node involvement, palpable cervical lymph nodes, vocal cord paralysis, lymphatic invasion, and extracapsular invasion.
Case series	The pattern of first failure was most often locoregional (82%, 36 patients).
Case series	Conclusion: The choice of free jejunal transfer or gastric pull-up for reconstruction after surgical resection of cervical esophageal carcinoma depends on the degree of tumor extension.
Case series	Adverse factors affecting survival should be considered when candidates for the surgery are selected.
Case series	Surgical management of carcinoma of the cervical esophagus
Case series	Background: Therapeutic strategies for cervical oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are controversial. Treatment options range from definitive radiotherapy to multimodal treatment.
Case series	Outcome after limited resection and reconstruction with a free jejunal graft interposition was evaluated retrospectively. Methods: Patients with clinical T1-4 Nx M0 tumours treated between 1986 and 2006 were included.
Case series	Results: Of 109 patients, 94 underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 15 had a primary resection. Complete or partial preservation of the larynx was achieved in 93 patients (85. 3 per cent). Minor and major complications occurred in 74.
Case series	3 per cent, with 44. 0 per cent of all patients having more than one complication. Reoperation was necessary in 29. 4 per cent. The 30-day mortality rate was 1. 8 per cent, and the in-hospital mortality rate 2. 8 per cent.
Case series	The complete R0 resection rate was 72. 5 per cent. Median overall survival was 34. 3 months; 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 83. 8, 47. 0 and 47. 0 per cent respectively. Survival was not influenced by complications (P = 0.
Case series	401) or reoperation (P = 0. 428). Conclusion: Despite high complication and reoperation rates, the mortality rate was low, even after preoperative chemoradiation.
Case series	This complex surgical strategy is a treatment option for cervical SCC in oncological centres with an infrastructure providing multidisciplinary management.
Case series	Limited resection and free jejunal graft interposition for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical oesophagus
Case series	Background: Salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy for cervical esophageal cancer and hypopharyngeal cancer remains a challenge because of the high rate of complications.
Case series	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of free jejunal transfer as salvage surgery for cervical esophageal cancer and hypopharyngeal cancer after definitive chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Methods: We enrolled eight patients with cervical esophageal cancer and 11 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer who underwent free jejunal transfer as salvage surgery following radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	In this study, we reviewed the surgical procedures, perioperative complications, and survival rates. Results: The median duration of surgery was 514 min, and the median blood loss was 439 ml.
Case series	In surgical procedures, the recipient vessels for the anastomosis of the free jejunum consisted of one artery and one vein (63 %), one artery and two veins (5 %), and two arteries and two veins (31 %). The postoperative morbidity rate was 57.
Case series	9 % (11 patients), with six cases of partial necrosis of the tracheal margin and no cases of graft necrosis or postoperative in-hospital death. The overall 5-year survival rate after surgery was 58. 1 %.
Case series	Conclusions: Our findings suggest that with careful attention to the potential development of necrosis of the tracheal margin, pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy and free jejunal transfer can be safely performed, even in patients who received radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	The use of short segment free jejunal transfer as salvage surgery for cervical esophageal and hypopharyngeal cancer
Case series	In the period between 1 January 1978 and 1 January 2004, 85 patients with hypopharyngeal squamocellular carcinoma were admitted at the Department of Esophagogastric Surgery in Belgrade. Among them, only 46 patients (54.
Case series	1%) had radical surgical en-block resection and functional neck dissection, and they were included into an historical cohort study.
Case series	In 40 patients a pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy was performed using for reconstruction, stomach tissue in 29 and colon tissue in 11 patients.
Case series	Since 1996, in six patients with localized hypopharyngeal carcinoma pharyngolaryngectomy was performed with resection of cervical esophagus and free jejunal graft interposition. The overall incidence of morbidity was 50.
Case series	0% and the overall mortality rate was 13. 0% (6 patients). Mean hospital stay was 35 days (range, 18-78 days). The median survival of patients was 26 months, and overall 5-year survival rate was 26. 5%.
Case series	At present, surgery seems to be the appropriate therapeutic choice for patients with advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma, providing a definitive palliation of dysphagia and relatively good long-term survival.
Case series	At our Institution, after pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy, reconstructive method of choice is gastric 'pull-up', and the colon is used only when stomach tissue is not available, that is, previous gastric resections, inappropriate blood supply, synchronous gastric carcinoma and so on.
Case series	Recently, pharyngolaryngectomy and free jejunal transfer has become the standard technique in patients with small carcinomas (up to 3 cm) confined to the hypopharynx in the absence of synchronous esophageal and/or gastric carcinoma.
Case series	Surgical treatment and clinical course of patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma
Case series	Purpose: Data on skip metastases and their significance are lacking for esophageal cancer. This issue is important to determine the extent of lymphadenectomy for esophageal resection.
Case series	In this study we examined the lymphatic spread in esophageal cancer by routine histopathology and by immunohistochemistry.
Case series	Patients and methods: A total of 1,584 resected lymph nodes were obtained from 86 patients with resected esophageal carcinoma and evaluated by routine histopathology.
Case series	Additionally, frozen tissue sections of 540 lymph nodes classified as tumor-free by routine histopathology were screened for micrometastases by immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody Ber-EP4.
Case series	The lymph nodes were mapped according to the mapping scheme of the American Thoracic Society modified by Casson et al.
Case series	Results: Forty-four patients (51%) had pN1 disease, and 61 patients (71%) harbored lymphatic micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry. Skip metastases detected by routine histopathology were present in 34% of pN1 patients.
Case series	Skipping of micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry was found in 66%. The presence of micrometastases was associated with a significantly decreased relapse-free and overall survival (56. 0 v 10. 0 months and > 64 v 15 months, P <.
Case series	0001 and P =. 004, respectively). Cox regression analysis revealed the independent prognostic influence of micrometastases in lymph nodes. Lymph node skipping had no significant independent prognostic influence on survival.
Case series	Conclusion: Histopathologically and immunohistochemically detectable skip metastases are a frequent event in esophageal cancer. Only extensive lymph node sampling, in conjunction with immunohistochemical evaluation, will lead to accurate staging.
Case series	An improved staging system is essential for more individualized adjuvant therapy.
Case series	Esophageal cancer: the mode of lymphatic tumor cell spread and its prognostic significance
Case series	Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the prevalence and location of regional lymph node metastases in adenocarcinoma confined to the esophagal wall, to determine the extent of dissection required, and to investigate the applicability of nonoperative therapy.
Case series	Methods: Histologic evaluation of the resected specimens after en bloc esophagogastrectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy was performed on 37 patients with adenocarcinoma confined to the esophageal wall.
Case series	Follow-up was complete in all patients (median 24 months). Results: Fifteen patients (41%) had intramucosal tumors. Twelve (32%) had submucosal tumors and 10 (27%) had muscular invasion.
Case series	The prevalence of regional lymph node metastases (15/37 patients, 41%) increased progressively with depth of tumor invasion, with involved nodes identified in 80% of patients with muscular invasion.
Case series	Lymph node metastases were also more common at distant node stations in intramuscular tumors (5/10, 50%). Actuarial survival for the entire group was 63% at 5 years.
Case series	Recurrence was identified in 6 of the 37 patients (16%), with the risk of recurrence correlating with tumor depth.
Case series	Conclusions: Tumor depth is a strong predictor of the probabilities of regional lymph node metastases, the likelihood of involvement of distant node groups, and the risk of recurrence.
Case series	Patients with invasion of the muscular wall are at particularly high risk. En bloc esophagectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy has the highest likelihood of achieving an R0 resection.
Case series	The long-term survival and low recurrence rate achieved with an en bloc esophagectomy emphasizes the importance of an aggressive lymph node dissection to remove all potentially involved nodes.
Case series	Prevalence and location of nodal metastases in distal esophageal adenocarcinoma confined to the wall: implications for therapy
Cohort study	Of 393 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma in the thoracic esophagus, 60 were found by histologic examination to have intramural metastasis. Metastases in 50 of these were identified by gross inspection.
Cohort study	There appeared to be no preference for location proximal to the primary lesion. Eighteen patients had metastasis to the gastric wall, which suggested the existence of communicating lymphatic channels between the wall of the esophagus and the stomach.
Cohort study	All 60 primary tumors invaded beyond the submucosa. These 60 patients (group A) were compared with a group of matched control patients without intramural metastasis (group B).
Cohort study	The tumor size in group A was significantly larger than in group B (p less than 0. 01). The number of patients with lymph-node metastasis was significantly higher in group A (p less than 0.
Cohort study	01), and the average number of positive nodes in group A was greater than in group B (p less than 0. 01). Recurrent disease in the mediastinal lymph nodes and in the liver is characteristic of group A.
Cohort study	The survival curve for patients in group A was significantly lower than that for group B (p less than 0. 001). Conventional radiotherapy or chemotherapy after surgery were ineffective in improving prognosis.
Cohort study	These results indicate that the presence of intramural metastasis is an important factor to consider when evaluating the prognosis of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Cohort study	Intramural metastasis of thoracic esophageal carcinoma
review	The need for radical resection and extensive lymphadenectomy for early adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus has recently been challenged.
review	Limited surgical resection and endoscopic mucosal ablation techniques are increasingly proposed and used as less invasive alternatives.
review	Available data indicate that a limited resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction with jejunal interposition is associated with less morbidity and mortality, provides similar oncologic results, and offers a better quality of life as compared with radical esophagectomy.
review	In contrast, endoscopic ablation and mucosectomy techniques are still plagued by high tumor recurrence rates, particularly in patients with incomplete removal of the underlying Barrett's mucosa, multicentric tumors, or tumors invading into the submucosa.
review	Attention to technical details of limited resection and jejunal interposition is, however, required to avoid complications, poor functional results, and the need for reintervention.
review	Limited surgical resection and jejunal interposition for early adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus
review	The recognition of Barrett's esophagus as a premalignant condition has led to aggressive endoscopic screening protocols aimed at detecting adenocarcinoma in this organ.
review	This policy has resulted in an increasing number of patients who present with 'early Barrett's cancer'.
review	In the existing literature, very little data address patients with these lesions and, therefore, no consistent definition of early Barrett's cancer currently exists.
review	Additionally, the extent of resection and lymphadenectomy that should be performed is not known. We define early Barrett's cancer as clinical T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma.
review	We perform en bloc esophagectomy with radical lymphadenectomy for these lesions because current data suggest that a more radical operation may improve survival in patients with esophageal cancer.
review	It is also the only way to stage adequately the tumour and is associated with morbidity and mortality rates comparable to less radical, 'standard' resections in experienced hands.
review	Barrett's esophagus is associated with invasive adenocarcinoma in 40% of patients who undergo esophagectomy for the preoperative diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia.
review	The existing literature suggests these lesions may represent the earliest subset of Barrett's cancer and that a standard, less radical resection may suffice for these patients.
review	Extent of resection and lymphadenectomy in early Barrett's cancer
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection is the best way to give Barrett's patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma a good chance of cure.
Case series	Material and methods: Fifty-five patients underwent subtotal (n = 47) or distal (n = 8) esophagectomy for Barrett's adenocarcinoma (n = 43) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) (n = 12). Thirteen patients (23.
Case series	6%) never had had any reflux symptom before disclosure of the neoplastic lesion, and 20 patients (36. 4%) had esophageal shortening. Ro resections (n = 50) included removal of the esophageal tube en bloc with the locoregional lymph nodes.
Case series	Results: An invasive carcinoma was found in the resected specimen of 4 of the 12 patients operated on for HGD.
Case series	Two of the 5 patients whose metaplasia was surveyed endoscopically were operated on for an advanced lesion (T2N1, T3N1) because they had not strictly complied with the proposed schedule.
Case series	One of the 4 patients whose HGD was followed up endoscopically until disclosure of deeper mucosal invasion had positive lymph nodes at operation. The prevalence of early lesions (Tis, T1, T2, No) was 7.
Case series	4% in patients with tumor-related symptoms versus 85. 7% in those having unrelated symptoms (P = 0. 0000), which resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 33. 8% and 82. 4%, respectively (P = 0. 0012).
Case series	Five-year survival rate after Ro resection made for invasive carcinoma was 59. 3% (all cases), 73. 1% (No), 61. 5% (< or =5 positive lymph nodes), and 0% (>5 positive lymph nodes).
Case series	Conclusions: High-grade dysplasia is an indication for esophageal resection. Early detection of the neoplastic transformation of Barrett's metaplasia prior to the onset of obstructive symptoms gives the best chance of cure.
Case series	Esophagectomy with radical lymph node clearance is capable of curing a large proportion of the patients having no or a limited number of metastatic lymph nodes.
Case series	Radical esophageal resection for adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus
Case series	Objective: The efficacy of esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection in surgical treatment for patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the lower thoracic esophagus remains controversial.
Case series	This report documents the outcomes of this surgical procedure for a large series.
Case series	Methods: From February 1986 to November 1998, 437 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection.
Case series	One hundred and sixteen of these had cancer of the lower thoracic esophagus.
Case series	To avoid the influence of adjuvant therapy on survival, 20 who also received radiation and/or chemotherapy were excluded, leaving 96 patients who were retrospectively analyzed.
Case series	Results: The operative morbidity, and 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 62, 0, and 3%, respectively. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 89, 65, and 59%, with a median survival of 76 months.
Case series	In those with lymph node metastases (66% of cases), the values were 87, 56, and 48%, as compared with 94, 84, and 79%, respectively (P=0. 005) for patients without lymph node metastasis.
Case series	Factors significantly influencing the overall survival rates were patient age (> or = 65 vs. <65), clinical N status (cN1 vs. cN0), clinical M status (cM1 vs. cM0), longitudinal tumor length of resected specimen (> or =5 vs.
Case series	<5 cm), pathologic T status (pT3 vs. pT1, 2), pathologic N status (pN1 vs. pN0), lymphatic invasion (positive vs. negative), vascular invasion (positive vs. negative) and intramural metastasis (present vs. absent).
Case series	Independent prognostic factors for survival determined by multivariate analysis were pathologic T status (P=0. 02), pathologic N status (P=0. 03), and presence of intramural metastasis (P=0. 04).
Case series	Additional pathologic M1 status, cervical or celiac lymph node metastasis, was without significant influence.
Case series	Conclusions: Patients with pathologic T3 tumors with both pathologic N1 status and the presence of intramural metastasis in the lower thoracic esophagus had a poor prognosis.
Case series	Cervical or celiac lymph node metastasis in patients with carcinomas of the lower thoracic esophagus should be distinguished from pathologic M1 status in the UICC-TNM staging system.
Case series	Prognostic evaluation for squamous cell carcinomas of the lower thoracic esophagus treated with three-field lymph node dissection
Case series	Purpose: The authors evaluated the efficacy of extended radical (three-field) lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer compared with less radical (two-field) lymphadenectomy.
Case series	STUDY SUBJECTS AND ANALYTIC METHODS: The mortality and morbidity rates, postoperative courses, and survival rates were compared between 63 patients who underwent three-field lymph node dissection and 65 who underwent two-field lymph node dissection at Kurume University Hospital from 1986 to 1991.
Case series	Long-term quality of life after surgery was compared between 37 patients who underwent three-field dissection and 35 who underwent two-field dissection from 1980 to 1991.
Case series	Results: Three-field dissection resulted in better survival for patients with positive lymph node metastasis from a carcinoma in the upper thoracic or midthoracic esophagus compared with two-field dissection.
Case series	The mortality rates, postoperative courses and quality of life were the same for both procedures.
Case series	Conclusions: Three-field dissection is preferred for upper thoracic or midthoracic esophageal cancer because of improved survival, acceptable mortality and morbidity rates, and good postoperative course and quality of life.
Case series	Mortality and morbidity rates, postoperative course, quality of life, and prognosis after extended radical lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer. Comparison of three-field lymphadenectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy
Case series	Background: The prognosis of patients without nodal metastasis of oesophageal cancer is generally good, but recurrence develops in some cases.
Case series	Methods: Data on 88 consecutive patients with squamous oesophageal cancer who underwent three-field lymph node dissection from 1986 to September 1998 and who had no evidence of nodal disease were reviewed retrospectively.
Case series	Disease status was based on histological examination of the section of each node with the largest surface area, stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
Case series	Results: The 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients without lymph node metastasis were 85 and 81 per cent respectively, better than in patients with metastasis. Twelve patients died from recurrence.
Case series	Recurrence was haematogenous in nine patients and locoregional in three. Survival was worse in men, for patients with lesions located in the upper thoracic oesophagus, and in those with lymphatic or blood vessel invasion.
Case series	Only the presence of lymphatic invasion correlated with survival on multivariate analysis (P = 0. 04).
Case series	Conclusion: Although survival was generally good in patients without nodal metastasis from oesophageal cancer following three-field lymph node dissection, patients with lymphatic invasion remained at risk for haematogenous dissemination.
Case series	Prognostic factors after oesophagectomy and extended lymphadenectomy for squamous oesophageal cancer
Case series	In 1986, several institutions in Japan began to employ extensive lymphadenectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer.
Case series	The aim of this article is to point out several confusing factors concerning the use of the terms "tow-field" and "three-field" lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal cancer.
Case series	In two-field nodal dissection, two components are included with (modern two-field) or without (traditional two-field) nodal dissection around both recurrent laryngeal nerve chains in the upper mediastinum.
Case series	We studied a series of 353 patients resected for thoracic esophageal cancer in our institution. The patients were divided into three groups.
Case series	Group A was the traditional two-field group of patients who underwent thoracoabdominal lymphadenectomy without upper mediastinal lymph node dissection after preoperative irradiation; group B was the modern two-field group, with additional upper mediastinal lymph node dissection; and group C was the three-field group with additional neck lymph node dissection.
Case series	Groups B and C were operated on during the same period and did not received preoperative irradiation. The 5-year survival rate in group B was 54. 9%, which was better than the 47. 6% rate after three-field dissection (group C).
Case series	The key to extensive lymphadenectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer does not lie in "cervical dissection" but in the meticulous dissection of the lymph nodes around the right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves.
Case series	Significance of extended systemic lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal carcinoma in Japan
Case series	Objective: Opinions are conflicting about 3-field lymph node dissection (3FLND) during esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
Case series	In the current study, we sought to determine the prevalence of cervical and upper thoracic lymph node metastasis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus and to determine the impact of 3FLND on mortality, morbidity, survival, and recurrence rate.
Case series	Materials and methods: Among 287 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus seen between November 1985 and December 2001, 141 (49%) underwent extended esophagectomy with 3FLND (cervical, mediastinal, and abdominal lymph node dissection).
Case series	Patients were observed and clinicopathologic information collected prospectively on all patients until death or August 2002. The median follow-up was 41 months, ranging from 10 to 173 months. Results: Hospital mortality and morbidity rates were 6.
Case series	4% and 80%, respectively. Thirty-four of 70 node-positive patients had cervicothoracic nodal involvement.
Case series	Sixteen patients (11%) had nodal involvement confined only to the cervicothoracic nodes, and no patients with lower thoracic esophageal carcinoma showed cervicothoracic involvement alone.
Case series	The frequency of cervical nodal disease was correlated with nodal status within the mediastinum (P <0. 01). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates for all 141 patients were 76%, 58%, and 48%, respectively.
Case series	Among significant variables verified by univariate analysis, independent prognostic factors for overall survival determined by multivariate analysis were number of lymph node metastasis (P <0. 01), amount of blood transfusion (P <0.
Case series	05), length of operation (P <0. 05), and presence of pulmonary complications (P <0. 05). Conclusions: Extended esophagectomy with 3FLND can be performed with an acceptable mortality.
Case series	Metastases frequently involved the upper thoracic and cervical lesions, and cervical nodal disease was correlated with thoracic nodal status. 3FLND proved to be an important staging system in 11% of patients.
Case series	An excellent overall survival suggests a superiority of 3FLND when performed at experienced centers.
Case series	Clinical outcomes of extended esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Introduction: It is controversial to routinely perform three-field lymph node dissection in patients with upper thoracic esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The objective of this study was to compare survival and recurrence according to the extent of lymph node dissection in patients with upper thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer.
Case series	Methods: Between 1995 and 2007, 91 patients underwent R0 esophagectomy (with no residual tumor) for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper thoracic esophagus at our institution.
Case series	Of these, 57 patients received three-field (cervical, mediastinal, and abdominal stations) lymph node dissection (3 FL group), whereas 34 received two-field (mediastinal and abdominal stations) lymph node dissection (2 FL group).
Case series	We retrospectively compared the early and late postoperative outcomes between the two groups. Results: No differences were observed between the two groups with regard to age, gender, and pathologic stage.
Case series	There was no in-hospital mortality in either group. The 5-year survival rate was 52% for the 2 FL group and 44% for the 3 FL group (p = 0. 65). The disease-free 5-year survival rate was 39% for the 2 FL group and 38% for the 3 FL group (p = 0. 97).
Case series	The overall recurrence rate and the incidence of cervical nodal recurrence were not significantly different between the two groups.
Case series	Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there was no survival benefit from the addition of cervical nodal dissection in patients with upper thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had no evidence of cervical lymph node metastasis.
Case series	Comparison of survival and recurrence pattern between two-field and three-field lymph node dissections for upper thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Background: The total number of resected lymph nodes (TLN) has been shown to predict survival in esophageal cancer, but its relationship with recurrence has been rarely reported.
Case series	We aim to study the prognostic factors in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, with a particular focus on the role of TLN.
Case series	Methods: Two hundred sixty-eight ESCC patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy were selected for the study. A Cox regression model was used to identify prognostic factors. Results: Recurrence occurred in 115 of 268 patients.
Case series	The median time to recurrence was 10 months (range, 1-58). The recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 62. 3%, 32. 1%, and 28. 5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified age (P = 0. 001), N stage (N1-3 vs. N0, P = 0.
Case series	001), tumor length (P = 0. 019), and development of recurrence (P < 0. 001) as independent prognostic factors for overall survival, whereas T (T3/4 vs. T1/2, P = 0. 029) and N stage (N1-3 vs. N0, P = 0.
Case series	017) were independent prognostic factors for recurrence. TLN was a significant factor only when predicting overall survival in N0 patients (HR, 0. 976; 95% CI, 0. 953-0. 999; P = 0. 042).
Case series	Conclusion: The TLN is not a prognostic factor for recurrence in ESCC patients undergone transthoracic esophagectomy.
Case series	The total number of resected lymph node is not a prognostic factor for recurrence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients undergone transthoracic esophagectomy
Case series	Background: After esophagectomy for cancer, the first choice for reconstruction of the gastrointestinal continuity is by gastric tube. When this is not feasible, a reconstruction by colon interposition can be performed.
Case series	The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life in patients at least 6 months after esophageal cancer resection and colon interposition without signs of recurrent disease.
Case series	The results were compared with previously published data of patients after esophageal cancer resection and gastric tube reconstruction.
Case series	Patients and methods: Between January 1993 and January 2002, 36 patients underwent esophageal cancer resection and gastrointestinal reconstruction by colon interposition.
Case series	A one-time Quality of Life assessment was carried out in 14 patients who were still disease free after a median follow-up of 21 months (mean 35, range 7-97).
Case series	The patients were visited at home and asked to fill in questionnaires which consisted of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey to assess general quality of life, an adapted Rotterdam Symptom Checklist to assess disease-specific quality of life, a visual analogue scale, and an additional questionnaire concerning other specific effects of the operation.
Case series	Results: All 14 patients returned the completed set of questionnaires. Compared to the previously published results of patients after gastric tube reconstruction patients with a colon interposition scored significantly (P < or = 0.
Case series	05) lower in five of the eight subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire (i. e. general health, physical role, vitality, social functioning, and mental health).
Case series	The most frequent symptoms measured by the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist were early satiety after a meal, dysphagia, diarrhea, loss of sexual interest, and fatigue.
Case series	Six patients could not independently run their housekeeping and four patients still needed artificial enteral nutrition. Conclusion: Based on the SF-36 questionnaire, patients after colon interposition by necessity have a poor general quality of life.
Case series	Even long after the operation they have a broad spectrum of persisting symptoms. Prior to surgery, patients should be informed about the disabling long-term functional outcome of a colon interposition.
Case series	Quality of life after colon interposition by necessity for esophageal cancer replacement
Case series	Background: From 1972 to 1996, bowel interposition reconstruction after esophagectomy for benign and malignant conditions was performed in 129 of 131 patients. The indication for operation was benign disease in 94 patients (72.
Case series	9%) and malignant disease in 35 patients (27. 1%). Benign stricture was the most common presentation in the benign group (41 patients), and adenocarcinoma was the most common indication in the malignant group (19 patients).
Case series	Methods: One hundred thirty-three conduits were performed in the 129 patients. Four patients (3. 1%) required reoperative reconstruction.
Case series	Of the 97 conduits employed for reconstruction of benign disease, the right colon was used in 70 patients, the left colon in 9 patients, and the transverse colon in 4 patients.
Case series	A jejunal interposition graft was employed in 11 patients and a free jejunal autograft in 3 patients. The right colon was used in 15 patients with malignant disease, the left colon in 9 patients, and the jejunum in 12 patients.
Case series	Results: The mean age of the population was 54. 5 years (range, 14 to 72 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 1. 3:1. The average number of prior thoracic or abdominal procedures was 2. 9 (range, 1 to 8) with 50.
Case series	9% of patients undergoing reoperation. The mean length of stay was 21. 7 days (range, 8 to 290 days). Complications occurred in 37. 1% of patients with anastomotic leak occurring in 14. 8% and ischemic colitis in 3. 0% of conduits performed.
Case series	The in-hospital mortality was 5. 9%.
Case series	Conclusions: Bowel interposition reconstruction after esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease can be performed with an acceptable morbidity and mortality, despite prior operative procedures in the abdomen or chest.
Case series	Colonic and jejunal conduits, employed alone or in combination, can effectively restore gastrointestinal continuity.
Case series	Bowel interposition for esophageal replacement: twenty-five-year experience
Case series	Hypothesis: The use of colonic interposition in esophageal replacement after esophagectomy for cancer results in similar morbidity, mortality, and long-term outcome compared with gastric transposition.
Case series	Design: Prospectively collected database on patients with esophageal cancer from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2000. Setting: Academic university hospital department of surgery.
Case series	Patients: We compared 42 patients who underwent colonic interposition (colon group) with 959 patients who underwent gastric transposition (stomach group) after esophagectomy. Main outcome measures: Morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival.
Case series	Results: Greater blood loss (median, 1000 vs 700 mL; P<. 001) and longer operation duration (median, 270 vs 225 minutes; P<. 001) were encountered in the colon group.
Case series	We found no difference in cardiopulmonary complications, but we found significantly greater incidences of anastomotic leakage (14. 3% vs 3. 9%; P =. 007) and intra-abdominal septic complications (9. 5% vs 0. 2%; P<. 001) in the colon group.
Case series	Conduit ischemia developed in 5 patients (0. 5%) in the stomach group, 3 of whom underwent successful staged reconstruction with colon. One patient (2. 4%) in the colon group was found to have conduit ischemia and died.
Case series	Hospital mortality rates included 7 patients (16. 7%) from the colon group and 102 (10. 6%) from the stomach group (P =. 21). These figures improved to 0 and 27 (5. 5%), respectively, in the second half of the study period (P>. 99).
Case series	Median survival was 12. 8 and 10. 4 months in the stomach and colon groups, respectively (P =. 4). Conclusions: Colonic interposition is a more complex procedure with increased morbidity, compared with gastric transposition.
Case series	Overall mortality and survival, however, were similar to those for gastric transposition.
Case series	Colonic interposition after esophagectomy for cancer
review	In a distinct subset of patients, traditional gastric conduits are not available as esophageal replacements, due to either intrinsic disease, tumor involvement, or previous surgery. Esophageal reconstruction in this group can prove daunting.
review	Colonic interposition can be considered as an alternative conduit, but the "supercharged" jejunum (SPJ) may also serve as another option for total esophageal reconstruction.
review	With an experienced hospital team familiar with esophageal surgery and microvascular reconstruction, morbidity is acceptable and long-term functional benefits may exist with this conduit.
review	This article will review the indications and potential problems with the SPJ and will try to impart some of the important technical points that have been identified to minimize the risk of this complex but useful esophageal reconstruction.
review	The supercharged microvascular jejunal interposition
Case series	Background: Experience with transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) for both benign and malignant diseases of the esophagus as practiced over an 18-year period is presented.
Case series	Methods: Between 1982 and 2000, 411 consecutive patients underwent THE for both benign (n = 44) and malignant (n = 367) diseases of esophagus. Surviving patients were followed up for a mean of 30. 4 months.
Case series	Results: The overall operative mortality was 11% which had reduced to 6% for the last 111 patients. Operative mortality in the benign group was less than 5%. Respiratory complications were the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality.
Case series	Nonfatal anastomotic leaks occurred in 14%. The overall actuarial survival rates at 2, 5, and 10 years for carcinoma patients were 54%, 38%, and 18% respectively.
Case series	The 2- and 5-year actuarial survival rates for postcricoid cancers were 83% and 64%, respectively. Conclusions: Transhiatal esophagectomy is safe and effective, and its results including long-term outcome are comparable with most published series.
Case series	Transhiatal esophagectomy for benign and malignant conditions
Case series	Of 262 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or cardia seen at the Lahey Clinic between January 1970 and January 1983, 209 (79. 8%) underwent surgical exploration.
Case series	This report is confined to the 167 operations performed in the division of the senior author.
Case series	Half of the tumors involved the esophagogastric junction with nearly equal numbers being located in the lower and upper halves of the thoracic esophagus and a relatively small number involving the cervical esophagus.
Case series	The majority were adenocarcinomas of which 20 developed in a Barrett esophagus. Three of the squamous cell cancers developed in an achalasic esophagus. Of the resected tumors, 94 were classified as Stage III, 18 as Stage II, and 37 as Stage I.
Case series	Esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy is the procedure of choice regardless of the level of the lesion. Of the 167 patients, 149 (89. 2%) underwent resection with two deaths within 30 days of operation for a hospital mortality rate of 1. 3%.
Case series	There were 22 major complications (14. 9%), which prolonged the hospital stay, and 14 minor complications (9. 5%). Satisfactory palliation of dysphagia was achieved in 82. 7% of the patients. The overall adjusted survival rate at 5 years was 21.
Case series	7% +/- 7. 5% (SEM) with a median survival time of 17. 3 months. The 5-year adjusted survival rate according to stage was 43. 4% for patients with Stage I lesions, 23. 6% for Stage II lesions, and 12. 8% for Stage III lesions (p = 0. 0004).
Case series	A multivariate analysis of risk factors involved in survival disclosed that neither age, sex, site of tumor, duration of symptoms, or cell type influenced survival, but stage of the disease had a profound effect.
Case series	It is concluded that long-term survival of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or cardia will probably not improve until early diagnosis is possible and that esophagogastrectomy by conventional techniques should be the treatment of choice until other forms of therapy prove superior to it both in terms of palliation and long-term survival.
Case series	Esophagogastrectomy. A safe, widely applicable, and expeditious form of palliation for patients with carcinoma of the esophagus and cardia
Case series	Objective: "Rediscovered" in 1976, transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) has been applicable in most situations requiring esophageal resection and reconstruction.
Case series	The objective of this study was to review the authors' 30-year experience with THE and changing trends in its use.
Case series	Methods: Using the authors' prospective Esophagectomy Database, this single institution experience with THE was analyzed retrospectively.
Case series	Results: Two thousand and seven THEs were performed-1063 (previously reported) between 1976 and 1998 (group I) and 944 from 1998 to 2006 (group II), 24% for benign disease, 76%, cancer. THE was possible in 98%.
Case series	Stomach was the esophageal substitute in 97%. Comparing outcomes between group I and group II, statistically significant differences (P < 0. 001) were observed in hospital mortality (4% vs. 1%); adenocarcinoma histology (69% vs.
Case series	86%); use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (28% vs. 52%); mean blood loss (677 vs. 368 mL); anastomotic leak (14% vs. 9%); and discharge within 10 days (52% vs. 78%).
Case series	Major complications remain infrequent: wound infection/dehiscence, 3%, atelectasis/pneumonia, 2%, intrathoracic hemorrhage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, chylothorax, and tracheal laceration, <1% each.
Case series	Late functional results have been good or excellent in 73%. Aggressive preoperative conditioning, avoiding the ICU, improved pain management, and early ambulation reduce length of stay, with 50% in group II discharged within 1 week.
Case series	Conclusion: THE refinements have reduced the historic morbidity and mortality of esophageal resection.
Case series	This largest reported THE experience reinforces the value of consistent technique and a clinical pathway in managing these high acuity esophageal patients.
Case series	Two thousand transhiatal esophagectomies: changing trends, lessons learned
Case series	Objective: To review the authors' clinical experience with transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) and the refinements in this procedure that have evolved.
Case series	Background: Increased use of THE during the past two decades has generated controversy about the merits and safety of this approach compared with transthoracic esophageal resection.
Case series	The authors' large THE experience provides a valuable basis for benchmarking data regarding the procedure.
Case series	Methods: The results of THE were analyzed retrospectively using the authors' prospectively established esophageal resection database and follow-up information on these patients.
Case series	Results: From 1976 to 1998, THE was performed in 1085 patients, 26% with benign disease and 74% with cancer. The procedure was possible in 98. 6% of cases. Stomach was the esophageal substitute in 96%. The hospital mortality rate was 4%.
Case series	Blood loss averaged 689 cc. Major complications were anastomotic leak (13%), atelectasis/pneumonia (2%), intrathoracic hemorrhage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, chylothorax, and tracheal laceration (<1% each).
Case series	Actuarial survival of patients with carcinoma equaled or exceeded that reported after transthoracic esophagectomy. Late functional results were good or excellent in 70%.
Case series	With preoperative pulmonary and physical conditioning, a side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis (<3% incidence of leak), and postoperative epidural anesthesia, the need for an intensive care unit stay has been eliminated and the length of stay reduced to 7 days.
Case series	Conclusion: THE is possible in most patients requiring esophageal resection and can be performed with greater safety and fewer complications than the traditional transthoracic approaches.
Case series	Transhiatal esophagectomy: clinical experience and refinements
review	Transhiatal esophagectomy is gaining increasing use as the preferred technique for esophagectomy. In this article, the indications, diagnostic evaluation, and technical details of the operative procedure for transhiatal esophagectomy are reviewed.
review	Results of large clinical series are discussed and the potential pitfalls and risks of the procedure are reviewed. Current controversies and future trends are also discussed.
review	The current role of transhiatal esophagectomy
Case series	Background: Various techniques have been described for the surgical treatment of esophageal cancer. The transhiatal approach has been debated for its safety and oncologic results.
Case series	Study design: Between January 1993 and September 1996, 115 patients underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy with curative intent for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the middle or distal esophagus or esophagogastric junction.
Case series	Procedure-related hazards, pathologic results, and prognostic factors for survival were evaluated.
Case series	Median duration of postoperative followup was 27 months (range 1 to 74 months) for all patients and 45 months (range 30 to 74 months) for those alive at final followup. Results: No emergency thoracotomies were experienced. In-hospital mortality was 3.
Case series	5%. Vocal cord dysfunction (24%) and pulmonary complications (23%) were the most frequent early postoperative complications. A microscopically radical resection was achieved in 73% of patients. Overall survival was 45% at 3 years.
Case series	In univariate analysis, the most pronounced indicators of longterm survival (p < 0. 0001) were radicality of the resection, lymph node involvement, lymph node ratio (ie, the ratio of invaded to removed lymph nodes), and pathologic tumor stage.
Case series	Multivariate analysis identified the lymph node ratio (p < 0. 0001) as the strongest independent predictor of long-term survival, followed by radicality of the resection (p = 0. 0064) and duration of ICU stay (p = 0. 027).
Case series	Conclusion: Transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy can be considered a safe procedure for resectable cancer of the midesophagus, distal esophagus, or esophagogastric junction.
Case series	Radicality and survival results were in line with the data reported for traditional transthoracic approaches. A prognostic value of the lymph node ratio was observed.
Case series	It emphasizes the need for controlled trials aimed at delineating the prognostic impact of an extended lymph node dissection.
Case series	Indicators of prognosis after transhiatal esophageal resection without thoracotomy for cancer
Case series	We retrospectively analyzed 238 patients with esophageal carcinoma treated between 1983 and 1991; 120 underwent transthoracic esophagectomy, and 118 underwent transhiatal esophagectomy.
Case series	The two groups were statistically similar in preoperative characteristics, except that upper esophageal cancer was more frequent in the transhiatal esophagectomy group than in the transthoracic esophagectomy group (p < 0. 01).
Case series	The rate of postoperative complications differed significantly in wound infection (21% in patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy, 10% in those who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy; p < 0.
Case series	05) and empyema (11% with transthoracic esophagectomy, 1% with transhiatal esophagectomy; p < 0. 01). Pneumothorax was detected in 24% of the transhiatal esophagectomy cases.
Case series	Intraoperative blood loss was 1340 +/- 490 ml in the transthoracic esophagectomy group and 930 +/- 340 ml in the transhiatal esophagectomy group (p < 0. 001). Hospital mortality was 11% in the transthoracic esophagectomy group and 6.
Case series	7% in the transhiatal esophagectomy group. Late complication rate was lower with transhiatal esophagectomy than with transthoracic esophagectomy (11% and 51%, respectively).
Case series	There was no significant difference in actuarial survival of patients in both groups. Transhiatal esophagectomy, which can be performed in almost all levels of the esophagus, is the safer of the two operations.
Case series	Transhiatal versus transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Although single-center series evaluating esophagectomy for cancer have demonstrated that this operation can be performed safely and with excellent outcomes, controversy remains regarding the comparable oncologic efficacy of the transhiatal and transthoracic approaches.
Case series	This study was performed to determine outcomes after transhiatal and transthoracic esophagectomy for patients undergoing resection nationwide.
Case series	Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database (1992 to 2002), we identified registered patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
Case series	We evaluated operative mortality, late survival, and length of stay while adjusting for patient characteristics, tumor grade, and stage. As a surrogate for postoperative quality of life, we also assessed subsequent need for anastomotic dilation.
Case series	Results: Of 868 patients undergoing either approach, for whom distinct Current Procedural Technology codes could be identified, 225 underwent transhiatal and 643 received transthoracic esophagectomy.
Case series	Lower operative mortality rate was observed after a transhiatal than transthoracic approach (6. 7% versus 13. 1%, p = 0. 009). Observed 5-year survival was higher for patients undergoing transhiatal rather than transthoracic esophagectomy (30.
Case series	5% versus 22. 7%, p = 0. 02). After adjusting for differences in tumor stage, patient, and provider factors, this survival advantage was no longer statistically significant (adjusted hazard ratio for mortality, 0. 95, 95% confidence interval: 0.
Case series	75 to 1. 20). Patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy were more likely to require endoscopic dilatation within 6 months of surgery (43. 1% versus 34. 5% for transthoracic operations, p = 0. 02).
Case series	Conclusions: In the largest population-based study to date assessing long-term outcome after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, transhiatal esophagectomy confers an early survival advantage, but long-term survival does not appear to differ according to surgical approach.
Case series	Outcomes after transhiatal and transthoracic esophagectomy for cancer
Case series	Characteristics of 10-year survival after esophagectomy for carcinoma were studied retrospectively in 161 patients who underwent curative operation between 1973 and 1984. Of the 161 patients, 44 (27.
Case series	3%) survived for 10 years after operation (right transthoracic approach with cervical anastomosis in 36 patients and left thoracoabdominal approach with jejunoesophagostomy in 8 patients).
Case series	Females survived significantly longer than males; 10-year survival was observed in 10 (50%) of 20 females and 34 (24. 1%) of 141 males. TNM factors were significantly linked to the 10-year survival for 25 patients (56.
Case series	8%) whose tumors invaded the adventitia and 20 patients (45. 5%) who had lymph node metastases, where the total number of involved nodes was less than eight.
Case series	A questionnaire mailed 10 years after operation revealed that about one-fifth of the 10-year survivors could not go up one flight of stairs without taking a rest, and that the daily activity significantly deteriorated if the patient's age at the time of surgery was more than 66 years.
Case series	One-third of the 10-year survivors were not satisfied with the daily quantity of food intake, resulting in no gain of body weight after discharge from the hospital.
Case series	This complaint was significantly correlated with either weekly reflux or heartburn, resulting in the increasing number of nonmalignancy deaths. Of 13 ten-year survivors who were alive at 10 years but died after that, 11 (84.
Case series	6%) died of pneumonia or malnutrition. Duodenogastroesophageal reflux may eventually cause nonmalignancy death 10 years after esophagectomy for carcinoma.
Case series	Appraisal of ten-year survival following esophagectomy for carcinoma of the esophagus with emphasis on quality of life
review	Purpose: To summarize the most current information about the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of esophagogastrostomy leaks following esophagectomy.
review	Method: The English language literature was searched by manual methods and MEDLINE for original articles reporting results and complications of esophagectomy.
review	Results: Esophagogastrostomy anastomotic leaks cause considerable morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy. Their major etiologic factors are ischemia of the gastric fundus and errors in surgical technique.
review	The clinical presentation of postoperative anastomotic leak ranges from an asymptomatic radiographic finding to a necrotizing thoracic infection.
review	Severity of illness is largely dependent on four factors: gastric viability, the site (thorax or neck) and time of the leak, and its containment by surrounding tissues.
review	Cervical anastomoses have a higher leak rate than thoracic anastomoses, but leaks from thoracic anastomoses are more morbid. Conclusion: Leaks from thoracic anastomoses require aggressive surgical treatment.
review	Cervical anastomotic leaks that are truly confined to the neck can usually be managed at the bedside with wound drainage and packing. However, the seriousness of cervical anastomotic leaks should not be underestimated.
review	Some leaks from anastomoses constructed in the neck are, in reality, mediastinal leaks. Selected patients with radiologically detected asymptomatic leaks can be managed conservatively.
review	Esophagogastrostomy anastomotic leaks complicating esophagectomy: a review
Case series	During the past 10 years, postoperative mortality associated with surgical treatment of oesophageal carcinoma has been reduced by one-half.
Case series	However, it appears that all efforts to improve long-term survival with extensive excisional procedures and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have failed.
Case series	Fifty-six of 100 patients presenting to the surgeon with an oesophageal carcinoma have resectable disease.
Case series	Recent studies suggest that seven of them will die from postoperative complications and 49 patients will be discharged from the hospital after an average of 3 weeks. Of these patients, 27 will survive the first, 12 the second, and ten the fifth year.
Case series	Although it may be possible to further reduce postoperative complications and mortality, the chances of improving the long-term prognosis of patients with oesophageal carcinoma seem small.
Case series	Surgical therapy of oesophageal carcinoma
Case series	An esophagogastric anastomotic leak, especially in the mediastinum or the chest, is a life-threatening complication of surgery for cancer of the esophagus.
Case series	Of 617 patients who underwent esophageal resection and esophagogastric anastomosis between January 1980 and December 1989, 39 (6. 32%) had anastomotic leakage; of these, 25 (64. 10%) died.
Case series	Various biologic parameters, operative techniques, and the management of leaks were analysed. Albumin concentration below 3 gm/dL (chi 2 = 3. 9; P = 0. 047), neoplastic permeation of the anastomotic cut margin (chi 2 = 4. 7; P = 0.
Case series	04), and cervical anastomosis (chi 2 = 12. 32; P = 0. 0004) were associated with a higher incidence of anastomotic leakage.
Case series	Hemoglobin level, type of suture material used for the anastomosis, preoperative radiotherapy, and the experience of the operating surgeon under supervision were found to be statistically insignificant factors and did not influence anastomotic leakage.
Case series	Mortality due to leak in the first postoperative week was 85% and was statistically significant as compared to the mortality occurring in the second postoperative week (chi 2 = 6. 04; P = 0. 013).
Case series	Surgical or conservative management of the leak did not influence mortality (chi 2 = 1. 2; P = 0. 27). The salvage rates for cervical and intrathoracic anastomotic leakage were 80% and 29. 4%, respectively.
Case series	This difference is statistically significant (chi 2 = 29; P = 0. 088).
Case series	Cancer of the esophagus: esophagogastric anastomotic leak--a retrospective study of predisposing factors
Case series	Cervical anastomosis has been advocated to avoid the pulmonary complications and life-threatening anastomotic disruptions following intrathoracic oesophagogastric anastomosis.
Case series	This is a retrospective review of 111 oesophageal resections followed by an intrathoracic anastomosis. These resections were performed between September 1993 and August 1994 within a residency training program.
Case series	The left thoracoabdominal approach was used for distal tumours and the Ivor Lewis technique for more proximal tumours. Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 72% patients (n = 80), adenocarcinoma for 25% (n = 28), and others for 2. 7% patients (n = 3).
Case series	Of the patients, 69% had pathologic Stage III tumours. Operative mortality rate was 1. 8% (two patients). Perioperative complications occurred in 39 patients, including anastomotic leak in 10 patients and myocardial infarction in 2 patients.
Case series	In the absence of a leak, there were no major pulmonary complications requiring intensive care or ventilatory support. Of those patients with anastomotic disruption, 80% were salvaged by early clinical diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
Case series	We conclude that transthoracic oesophagectomy with an intrathoracic anastomosis is a safe procedure that can be performed with low mortality and acceptable morbidity.
Case series	Intrathoracic anastomosis after oesophageal resection for cancer
Case series	Background: Leakage from esophageal anastomoses is higher than that for other gastrointestinal anastomoses. An intrathoracic anastomotic leak is a potentially catastrophic event.
Case series	Methods: Patients with and without thoracic anastomotic leakage were compared for predisposing factors. Leak-related mortality was analyzed. Results: Of 475 patients, there were 17 leaks (3. 5%).
Case series	Predisposing technical factors occurred significantly more frequently in patients who leaked. Sixteen such events were identified as contributory in 11 patients.
Case series	The hospital mortality for patients who leaked was significantly higher (35% versus 9%, P = 0. 005). Inadequate drainage and persistent sepsis accounted for 4 of the 6 deaths.
Case series	The need for inotropic support postoperatively correlated with leak-related mortality (66% versus 0%, P = 0. 006), while leak size, time to diagnosis, or method of drainage did not. Conclusions: Thoracic anastomotic leaks are largely preventable.
Case series	Leak-related mortality for the series was 1% and was most commonly related to inadequate drainage.
Case series	Critical appraisal of the significance of intrathoracic anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy for cancer
Case series	Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnosis, management and outcome of mediastinal leaks following radical oesophagectomy with a stapled intrathoracic anastomosis.
Case series	Methods: Some 291 consecutive patients underwent two-phase subtotal oesophagectomy with gastric interposition for malignancy.
Case series	Patients with clinical suspicion of a leak were investigated with contrast radiology and flexible upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Results: Nineteen patients (6.
Case series	5 per cent) developed a proven mediastinal leak at a median of 8 (range 3-30) days following surgery.
Case series	Contrast radiology and flexible upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified that 13 patients had an isolated leak from the oesophagogastric anastomosis and two had widespread leakage secondary to gastrotomy-line dehiscence.
Case series	Endoscopy revealed a further four patients with gastric necrosis in whom contrast radiology was normal. In six patients the diagnosis of leakage followed an apparently normal routine contrast examination on day 5-8.
Case series	All 13 isolated anastomotic leaks were managed non-operatively with targeted mediastinal drainage, intravenous antibiotics and antifungal therapy, nasogastric decompression and enteral nutrition; the mortality rate was 15 per cent (two of 13).
Case series	Patients with gastrotomy dehiscence or gastric necrosis had a more severe clinical picture; they were managed with repeat thoracotomy and either revision of the conduit or resection and exclusion.
Case series	Despite early intervention four of the six patients died. Conclusion: Routine postoperative contrast radiology cannot be recommended. On clinical suspicion of a leak patients require both contrast radiology and endoscopic evaluation.
Case series	Isolated anastomotic leaks can be managed successfully with non-operative treatment, whereas more extensive leaks from the gastric conduit require revisional surgery which carries a high mortality rate.
Case series	Diagnosis and management of a mediastinal leak following radical oesophagectomy
Case series	Background: Little consensus exists and varying outcomes are reported when the 4 most common esophagogastric anastomotic techniques are compared: circular stapled (CS), hand sewn (HS), linear stapled (LS) (longitudinally stapled anastomosis), and modified Collard (MC) (combined linear and transverse stapled anastomosis).
Case series	This report analyzes outcomes of these anastomotic techniques. Methods: From July 2004 through December 2008, all intrathoracic and cervical esophagogastric anastomoses at our institution were reviewed.
Case series	Results: There were 432 patients (358 men, 74 women) who underwent primary esophagogastric operations. Median age was 64 years (range, 23-90 years).
Case series	The approach was an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy in 254 patients (59%), transhiatal esophagectomy in 115 patients (27%), McKeown (3-hole) esophagectomy in 49 (11%) patients, minimally invasive esophagectomy in 9 (2.
Case series	1%) patients, and thoracoabdominal esophagectomy in 6 (1. 4%) patients. There were 268 intrathoracic (62%) and 164 cervical (38%) anastomoses.
Case series	Anastomotic techniques included LS in 260 (60%) patients MC in 67 (16%) patients, HS in 57 (13%) patients, and CS in 48 (11%) patients. Operative mortality was 3. 7%. Anastomotic leak occurred in 50 patients (11%).
Case series	Grade III or IV leaks occurred in 21 patients (4. 9%), including 13 in the chest (4. 8%) and 8 in the neck (4. 9%). Grade III or IV leaks occurred in 12 patients (4. 6%) with LS anastomoses, in 4 (7. 0%) patients with HS anastomoses, in 3 (6.
Case series	2%) patients with CS anastomoses, and in 2 (3. 0%) patients with MC anastomoses. HS anastomoses had the highest odds of leakage (p=0. 01) and LS anastomoses had the lowest risk of stricture (p=0. 006).
Case series	Conclusions: When performing an esophagogastric anastomosis, clinically significant leaks occur with similar frequency in both cervical and intrathoracic locations.
Case series	The HS technique has the highest leak rate and the LS technique had the lowest rate of stricture formation.
Case series	A comprehensive review of anastomotic technique in 432 esophagectomies
Case series	Transthoracic esophagogastrectomy is a safe operation. Mechanical staplers and a cervical anastomosis have been emphasized to avoid catastrophic consequences of anastomotic leaks in the chest.
Case series	Transhiatal esophagectomy has been proposed to bring the anastomosis into the neck. It is meant to be a palliative procedure and consequently denies the patient the best chance for surgical cure.
Case series	The emphasis should be on anastomotic technique and sound principles of surgical oncology. Since 1980, we have performed 104 esophagectomies for carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	We used a left thoracoabdominal incision for distal tumors (64) and the Ivor Lewis technique (40) for more proximal tumors. A two-layer inverting interrupted silk suture technique was used for all anastomoses.
Case series	More than 90% of the procedures were performed by resident staff. The operative mortality was 2. 9% (3 patients). There were no anastomotic leaks. Five patients required between one dilation and three dilations postoperatively.
Case series	A positive smoking history was present in 83 patients and substantial alcohol use, in 33. Median estimated blood loss was 500 ml, and 60% of patients required no transfusions.
Case series	Major complications included pneumonia (12 patients) and reexploration for bleeding (2).
Case series	Minor complications included atelectasis (71 patients), atrial fibrillation (9), ventricular arrhythmias (9), urinary tract infection (3), and wound infection (2). Squamous cancer was present in 31 patients and adenocarcinoma, in 73.
Case series	Positive lymph node metastases were present in 75%. Anastomotic recurrence was documented in 6 patients. Standard techniques of esophagogastrectomy and a two-layer anastomosis will give excellent results with low mortality and acceptable morbidity.
Case series	Transthoracic esophagectomy: a safe approach to carcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	Objective: A review of findings and results after standard resection for carcinoma of the esophagus and cardia without neoadjuvant therapy was done to provide a basis for comparison with current reports of radical resection and neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Methods: A 24-year experience on one surgical service with 454 operations for carcinoma of the esophagus and cardia was reviewed.
Case series	A comparison of findings and results in three consecutive 8-year intervals was analyzed, and new staging criteria were developed and compared with those currently favored by the American Joint Committee on Cancer.
Case series	Results: From January 1, 1970, to January 1, 1994, 454 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or cardia underwent operation, of whom 408 (90%) had esophagogastrectomy with a 30-day mortality rate of 2.
Case series	5% and an additional hospital mortality rate of 1. 2%. Of the 121 complications (30. 7%), 71 (18%) were major and 50 (12. 7%) were minor. Cardiovascular complications predominated. The overall 5-year survival was 24. 7%, with a 33.
Case series	7% survival after complete resections in the most recent interval under study. Palliation of dysphagia was achieved in nearly 80% of patients who survived the operation.
Case series	During the three intervals under review, resectability, mortality, and complication rates remained constant. The percentages of left thoracotomies and transhiatal resections increased, and there was a decrease in thoracoabdominal incisions.
Case series	The percentages of patients with Barrett's esophagus and stage 0 and I tumors increased.
Case series	The percentage of complete resections (R0) increased, whereas that for resections with residual microscopic tumor (R1) decreased, and there was no change in the percentage of patients with residual gross tumor after resection (R2).
Case series	Modified WNM staging criteria are proposed that provide better prognostic stratification of the disease than those currently favored by The American Joint Committee on Cancer.
Case series	Conclusions: Standard esophagogastrectomy is applicable in 90% of patients with operable carcinoma of the esophagus or cardia, with consistently low mortality and morbidity rates and satisfactory palliation of dysphagia. The 5-year survival (24.
Case series	7% overall) remains suboptimal, but the current figure for complete resections (33. 7%) is encouraging. There is a need for revision of the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria.
Case series	Esophagogastrectomy for carcinoma of the esophagus and cardia: a comparison of findings and results after standard resection in three consecutive eight-year intervals with improved staging criteria
Case series	During the period from October 1972 to January 1983, 462 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were admitted to Toranomon Hospital.
Case series	Those patients with carcinoma of the hypopharynx, cervical esophagus, or cardia extending to the esophagus were excluded from the study. Resection and reconstruction were carried out in 295 patients with a resectability rate of 63.
Case series	9 percent and an operative mortality rate of 1. 7 percent. The 5 year survival rate for 101 patients who had resection with minimum 5 year follow-up was 34. 7 percent.
Case series	Although the ultimate outcome is largely influenced by the tumor type representing malignancy, it is worthwhile to make all efforts to resect the tumor with a negative surgical margin and to resect concomitant lesions if there are any.
Case series	Surgeons should not be discouraged by the length or size of a tumor. The extent of positive lymph node is closely related to long-term results.
Case series	However, systemic lymph node dissection should be carried out because 5 year survival can then be expected, even when positive nodes are dissected from various areas.

review	Options in the surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: To examine the efficacy of the Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal carcinoma prior to the widespread use of preoperative chemotherapy and irradiation, we reviewed our experience.
Case series	Methods: We reexamined the cases of 220 consecutive patients who underwent an Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer from January 1992 through December 1995. Results: There were 196 men (89. 1%) and 24 women.
Case series	Median age was 65 years (range, 29 to 85 years). The results of pathological study showed adenocarcinoma in 188 patients (85. 5%), squamous cell carcinoma in 31 (14. 1%), and leiomyosarcoma in 1 patient (0. 5%).
Case series	Postsurgical staging was as follows: stage 0 in 10 patients, stage I in 19, stage IIa in 38, stage IIb in 28, stage III in 111, and stage IV in 14. The operative mortality rate was 1. 4% (3 patients), and complications occurred in 83 patients (37.
Case series	7%). Follow-up was 98. 6% complete. Median survival for operative survivors was 1. 9 years (range, 32 days to 8. 7 years). The overall 5-year survival rate was 25. 2%; it was 80% for patients in stage 0, 94. 4% for those in stage I, 36.
Case series	0% for those in stage IIa, 14. 3% for patients in stage IIb, 10% for those in stage III and 0% for patients in stage IV. Conclusions: Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer is a safe operation. Long-term survival is stage dependent.
Case series	The low survival associated with advanced cancers should stimulate the search for effective neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: Esophageal resection represents a major surgical and physiologic insult carrying major morbidity and mortality. We present the results of esophagectomy in a specialist unit with emphasis on early complications and their management.
Case series	Study design: From January 4, 1990 through January 6, 2000, 228 patients have undergone Ivor Lewis subtotal esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy for malignancy under the care of one surgeon.
Case series	The median age was 64 years (range 39 to 77 years), with a male to female ratio of 2. 3:1 and a predominance of adenocarcinoma (n = 146) compared with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 75) and other tumors (n = 7).
Case series	Detailed prospective data were collected on preoperative status, operative parameters, and postoperative complications.
Case series	Results: Median ICU stay was 1 day (range 1 to 47 days) and the median postoperative hospital stay in patients surviving surgery (n= 219) was 13 days (range 9 to 159 days).
Case series	There were 119 separate postoperative complications occurring in 45% of patients (102 of 228), comprising predominantly pulmonary morbidity. Major respiratory complications (17%) were significantly associated with poor preoperative spirometry (p = 0.
Case series	002) and a history of smoking (p = 0. 03). Seven percent of patients (16 of 228) suffered cardiovascular or thromboembolic complications. Major surgical complications occurred in 10% of patients (22 of 228) including mediastinal leaks in 4%.
Case series	Isolated anastomotic leaks (2%) were successfully treated conservatively in all cases; extensive leaks from ischemic gastric conduits (1%) or gastrotomy dehiscence (1%) underwent further exploration and either local repair or resection and exclusion.
Case series	Reoperation for hemostasis was required in 3% (6 of 228) and only 1% of patients (2 of 228) developed chyle leaks. Thirty-day mortality was 2%, rising to 4% for in-hospital mortality. The nine fatalities were significantly older (p = 0.
Case series	02) than those who survived and 67% (6 of 9) had suffered primary surgical complications.
Case series	Conclusions: Overall morbidity after radical esophagectomy is high, but early recognition and aggressive management of complications can minimize subsequent mortality.
Case series	Concentration of facilities and surgical expertise in specialist units together with more careful patient selection can decrease mortality further.
Case series	Early complications after Ivor Lewis subtotal esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy: risk factors and management
Case series	The classic approach for esophagectomy is via a combined thoracic and abdominal approach. Concerns persist regarding the adequacy of this approach as a cancer operation.
Case series	A study was carried out to compare these approaches, with particular reference to complication rates and long-term survival.
Case series	The charts of all adult patients undergoing esophagectomy for carcinoma at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital between July 1991 and June 1996 were reviewed.
Case series	Patients who had transabdominal resections alone or colon interpositions were excluded. Of 65 esophageal resections, 38 (58%) were performed transhiatally (THE) and 27 (42%) were performed via the transthoracic (TTE) route.
Case series	Treatment groups were matched for age and site, stage, and histology of tumor. Similarly, the treatment groups were homogeneous with respect to distribution of neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation.
Case series	The number of patients experiencing any postoperative complication was similar in both treatment groups, occurring in 22 THE (58%) and 17 TTE (63%) patients (P>0. 05). Anastomotic leak occurred in five THE patients (13%) and one TTE patient (4%) (P>0.
Case series	05). The single TTE patient with a leak died within 3 months without leaving the hospital. All five THE patients who developed a leak left the hospital.
Case series	Although there was a tendency toward a higher percentage of patients in the TTE group to suffer respiratory failure and sepsis and a higher percentage of THE patients to experience anastomotic leak, these did not reach statistical significance.
Case series	Again, although perioperative mortality tended to be higher in the TTE group, this did not reach statistical significance. Four and 5-year survival rates were similar in both groups.
Case series	Whereas a 4-year cumulative survival difference of 42% for THE patients and 31% in TTE patients extended at 58 months to 28% and 8%, respectively, these did not reach statistical significance.
Case series	Similarly, analysis by stage and preoperative treatment type (+/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation) failed to demonstrate any survival difference between the two groups.
Case series	These findings demonstrate that there is little difference in operative morbidity and mortality between THE and TTE routes. Anastomotic leaks that occur after cervical anastomosis tend to run a more benign course.
Case series	Survival data do not support routine TTE as a superior oncological operation, despite the theoretical benefit of better lymphatic clearance.
Case series	We continue to advocate THE because it allows a cervical anastomosis without thoracotomy and we feel it is better tolerated by patients.
Case series	Transhiatal versus transthoracic esophagectomy: complication and survival rates
Case series	Background: Transhiatal esophagectomy is a popular method of resection because of its reported lower morbidity and mortality and similar survival rates compared to transthoracic esophagectomy.
Case series	A review of recent experience with these two procedures for resection of distal esophageal and cardia adenocarcinoma is reported.
Case series	Methods: From 1988 to 1994, 48 patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and gastric cardia were resected with intent to cure, 32 by transhiatal esophagectomy (group 1) and 16 by transthoracic esophagectomy (group II).
Case series	The two groups were comparable in terms of patient demographics, preoperative risk factors, tumor stage, tumor differentiation, and involvement of resection margins (all not significant [NS]).
Case series	Results: There was no significant difference in median intensive care unit stay, median hospital stay, incidence of postoperative anastomotic leak, and stricture. Respiratory complications were higher in group I (41% versus 6%, P = 0. 01).
Case series	Hospital mortality was not significantly different for the two groups (group I 3. 1% versus group II 0%, NS). Actuarial 5-year survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) were 12% for group I and 39% for group II (NS).
Case series	Conclusions: These results suggest that when compared with transhiatal esophagectomy, the transthoracic approach is at least as safe, has comparable complication and survival rates, and remains an acceptable procedure for resection of adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastric cardia.
Case series	Transhiatal versus transthoracic esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and cardia
randomized controlled trial	Background: The question whether transhiatal (TH) or transthoracic (TT) resection is most suited for the extirpation of an esophageal cancer remains unresolved. The present study compared the two approaches in a prospective randomized manner.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Thirty-nine patients with carcinoma of the lower third of the esophagus who were clinically fit for either TH or TT resection were prospectively randomized to TH (20 patients) and TT (19 patients) resection.
randomized controlled trial	Patients of the two groups were comparable in age, sex, preoperative tumor staging, and pulmonary and cardiac risks for surgery.
randomized controlled trial	Results: There was no significant difference in the amount of blood loss between the two groups although intraoperative hypotension (systolic <80 mm Hg) occurred more frequently in the TH group (P <0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	The mean operating time for the TH and TT groups were 174 minutes and 210 minutes, respectively (P <0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	There was no difference in postoperative ventilatory requirements, cardiopulmonary complication rates, and, mean hospital stay between the two groups.
randomized controlled trial	There was no 30-day mortality in either group but there were 3 hospital deaths in the TH group from bronchopneumonia (2 patients) and disseminated malignancy (1 patient). The median survival rates were 16 and 13.
randomized controlled trial	5 months, respectively, for the TH and TT groups (P = NS). Conclusions: Although there was no demonstrable statistical difference in results between TH and TT approaches, the TT approach is preferred as it allowed for a more controlled operation.
randomized controlled trial	A prospective randomized comparison of transhiatal and transthoracic resection for lower-third esophageal carcinoma
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To determine whether extended transthoracic esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of the mid/distal esophagus improves long-term survival. Background: A randomized trial was performed to compare surgical techniques.
randomized controlled trial	Complete 5-year survival data are now available.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A total of 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (type I) or gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus (type II) were randomly assigned to limited transhiatal esophagectomy or to extended transthoracic esophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with peroperatively irresectable/incurable cancer were excluded from this analysis (n = 15). A total of 95 patients underwent transhiatal esophagectomy and 110 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Results: After transhiatal and transthoracic resection, 5-year survival was 34% and 36%, respectively (P = 0. 71, per protocol analysis).
randomized controlled trial	In a subgroup analysis, based on the location of the primary tumor according to the resection specimen, no overall survival benefit for either surgical approach was seen in 115 patients with a type II tumor (P = 0. 81).
randomized controlled trial	In 90 patients with a type I tumor, a survival benefit of 14% was seen with the transthoracic approach (51% vs. 37%, P = 0. 33).
randomized controlled trial	There was evidence that the treatment effect differed depending on the number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (test for interaction P = 0. 06).
randomized controlled trial	In patients (n = 55) without positive nodes locoregional disease-free survival after transhiatal esophagectomy was comparable to that after transthoracic esophagectomy (86% and 89%, respectively).
randomized controlled trial	The same was true for patients (n = 46) with more than 8 positive nodes (0% in both groups).
randomized controlled trial	Patients (n = 104) with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen showed a 5-year locoregional disease-free survival advantage if operated via the transthoracic route (23% vs. 64%, P = 0. 02).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: There is no significant overall survival benefit for either approach.
randomized controlled trial	However, compared with limited transhiatal resection extended transthoracic esophagectomy for type I esophageal adenocarcinoma shows an ongoing trend towards better 5-year survival.
randomized controlled trial	Moreover, patients with a limited number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen seem to benefit from an extended transthoracic esophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Extended transthoracic resection compared with limited transhiatal resection for adenocarcinoma of the mid/distal esophagus: five-year survival of a randomized clinical trial
randomized controlled trial	A prospective randomized trial of 67 patients undergoing oesophagectomy by either a transhiatal approach or right-sided thoracotomy was conducted over a 40-month period.
randomized controlled trial	In 32 patients the approach was transhiatal and 35 had a thoracotomy; the groups were well matched before operation. There were two hospital deaths in patients having the transhiatal oesophagectomy and three in those undergoing thoracotomy.
randomized controlled trial	Blood transfusion, intensive care stay and overall time of hospitalization were not significantly different between the two groups.
randomized controlled trial	There was no difference in the postoperative morbidity rate and, in particular, the incidences of pulmonary complications were similar (19 per cent for transhiatal oesophagectomy, 20 per cent for thoracotomy) with anastomotic fistula in 6 and 9 per cent respectively.
randomized controlled trial	The median (range) operating time was significantly longer in patients having thoracotomy (6 (3. 5-9. 5) versus 4 (3-8) h). Long-term survival was unaffected by the type of operation performed or addition of preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Nodal status was a significant prognostic factor within but not between the two groups.
randomized controlled trial	It is concluded that oesophagectomy by a transhiatal route or right thoracotomy are equally effective surgical options for treatment of squamous cell oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Oesophagectomy by a transhiatal approach or thoracotomy: a prospective randomized trial
Case series	Objective: Debate continues as to whether transhiatal esophagectomy results in lower morbidity and mortality than transthoracic esophagectomy. Most data addressing this issue are derived from single-institution studies.
Case series	To investigate this question from a nationwide multicenter perspective, we used the Veterans Administration National Surgical Quality Improvement Program to prospectively analyze risk factors for morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy or transhiatal esophagectomy from 1991 to 2000.
Case series	Methods: Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on 945 patients (mean age, 63 +/- 10 years). There were 562 transthoracic esophagectomies and 383 transhiatal esophagectomies in 105 hospitals, with complete 30-day outcomes recorded.
Case series	Results: There were no differences in recorded preoperative variables between the groups that might bias any comparisons. Overall mortality was 10. 0% (56/562) for transthoracic esophagectomy and 9. 9% (38/383) for transhiatal esophagectomy (P =.
Case series	983). Morbidity occurred in 47% (266/562) of patients after transthoracic esophagectomy and in 49% (188/383) of patients after transhiatal esophagectomy (P =. 596).
Case series	Risk factors for mortality common to both groups included a serum albumin value of less than 3. 5 g/dL, age greater than 65 years, and blood transfusion of greater than 4 units (P <. 05).
Case series	When comparing transthoracic esophagectomy with transhiatal esophagectomy, there was no difference in the incidence of respiratory failure, renal failure, bleeding, infection, sepsis, anastomotic complications, or mediastinitis.
Case series	Wound dehiscence occurred in 5% (18/383) of patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy and only 2% (12/562) of patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy (P =. 036).
Case series	Conclusions: These data demonstrate no significant differences in preoperative variables and postoperative mortality or morbidity between transthoracic esophagectomy and transhiatal esophagectomy on the basis of a 10-year, prospective, multi-institutional, nationwide study.
Case series	Transthoracic versus transhiatal esophagectomy: a prospective study of 945 patients
meta analysis	There is much controversy about the surgical approach to esophageal carcinoma: should an extensive resection be done to optimize long-term survival or should the extent of the operation be limited to obtain lower perioperative morbidity and mortality rates? We systematically reviewed the English-language literature published during the past decade, with emphasis on the differences between transthoracic and transhiatal resections regarding early morbidity, in-hospital mortality rates, and 3- and 5-year survival.
meta analysis	Although transthoracic resections had significantly higher early (pulmonary) morbidity and mortality rates, 5-year survival was approximately 20% after both transthoracic and transhiatal resections.

review	Left transthoracic esophagectomy
Case series	Background: Several techniques for esophageal resection have been reported.
Case series	This study examines the morbidity, mortality, and early survival of patients after transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma using current staging techniques and neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	The technique includes right thoracotomy, laparotomy, and cervical esophagogastrostomy (total thoracic esophagectomy) with radical mediastinal and abdominal lymph node dissection.
Case series	Methods: Three hundred forty-two patients had surgery for esophageal carcinoma between 1989 and 2000 at our institution. Two hundred fifty consecutive patients had esophagectomy using this technique.
Case series	Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by postsurgical pathologic stage. Results: Median age was 62. 7 years (31 to 86 years). Fifty-nine were female.
Case series	Eighty-one percent (202) had induction chemotherapy (all patients with clinical T3/4 or N1). Early postoperative complications included recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (14% [35]), chylothorax (9%, [22]), and leak (8%, [19]).
Case series	Median length of stay was 13 days (5 to 330 days). In-hospital or 30-day mortality was 3. 6% (9).
Case series	Overall survival at 3 years was 44%; median survival was 25 months, and 3-year survival by posttreatment pathologic stage was: stage 0 (complete response) (n = 60), 56%; stage I (n = 32), 65%; stage IIA (n = 67), 41%; stage IIB (n = 30), 46%; and stage III (n = 49), 17%.
Case series	Mean follow-up was 24 months (SEM 1. 6, 0 to 138 months). Five patients with tumor in situ, 6 patients with stage IV disease, and 1 patient who could not be staged (12 pts) were excluded from survival and multivariate calculations.
Case series	In univariate and different models of multivariate analysis, age more than 65 years, posttreatment T3, and nodal involvement were predictive of poor survival. For univariate analysis, p = 0. 002, p = 0. 004, p = 0.
Case series	02, respectively; for multivariate analysis, p = 0. 001, p = 0. 003, p = 0. 02, respectively.
Case series	Conclusions: Total thoracic esophagectomy with node dissection for esophageal cancer appears to have acceptable morbidity and mortality with encouraging survival results in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Patients who show complete response after induction chemoradiotherapy appear to have improved long-term survival.

review	Total three-stage oesophagectomy for cancer of the oesophagus
Case series	Background: The frequency and causes of gastrointestinal complications following esophagectomy for malignancy are unknown.
Case series	Patients and methods: We reviewed 295 esophagectomies performed for malignancy between January 1980 and September 1994 in order to determine the frequency and causes of early and late gastrointestinal complications.
Case series	Results: Compared to transhiatal and left thoracoabdominal esophagectomies, esophagectomies carried out through a right posterolateral thoracotomy with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis had a higher incidence of delayed gastric emptying (11%), pneumonia (26%), and hospital death (9%).
Case series	The same operation had a higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (20%) and dysphagia requiring esophageal dilatation (53%).
Case series	We found no independent effect of gastric drainage procedures, feeding jejunostomy, preoperative radiotherapy, pathology, or age on these outcomes.
Case series	Women had no operative mortality, but a higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux and diarrhea following esophagectomy.
Case series	Conclusions: Surgical techniques aimed at improving gastric emptying following esophagectomy for cancer should improve operative morbidity and mortality.
Case series	Gastrointestinal function following esophagectomy for malignancy
Case series	One hundred thirty-one patients (107 men and 24 women) underwent transhiatal esophagectomy for carcinoma of the esophagus. Median age was 65. 3 years (range, 30 to 89 years).
Case series	Signs and symptoms were present in 130 patients, which included dysphagia in 96 (73. 3%) and weight loss (median, 7. 7 kg) in 52 (39. 7%).
Case series	The cancer involved the gastroesophageal junction in 94 patients, the lower half of the intrathoracic esophagus in 25, the upper half in 10, and multiple sites in 2. An adenocarcinoma was present in 101 patients (77.
Case series	1%), squamous cell carcinoma in 29 (22. 1%), and adenosquamous cell in 1 (0. 8%). The cancer was classified as stage 0 in 4 patients, stage I in 16, stage IIA in 26, stage IIB in 18, stage III in 65, and stage IV in 1.
Case series	The stomach was used to replace the esophagus in all patients. Operative mortality was 2. 3%.
Case series	Anastomotic leak developed in 32 patients; 6 leaks were not clinically significant, 12 healed with drainage alone, and 14 required further surgical intervention. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 6. 7 years (median, 1. 4 years).
Case series	Currently, 42 patients are alive, 34 without evidence of recurrence. Overall 5-year survival was 20. 8% and varied according to stage. Five-year survival was 47. 5% for patients with stage I disease compared with 37.
Case series	7% for patients in stage II and only 5. 8% 4-year survival for patients in stage III. Cell type also influenced survival. Five-year survival for patients with adenocarcinoma was 27.
Case series	1% compared with zero for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0. 03). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).
Case series	Transhiatal esophagectomy for carcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	Background: The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia is rising in Western countries. This study evaluates prognostic factors associated with surgical management of this cancer.
Case series	Study design: Medical records of consecutive patients with gastric cardial cancer treated by surgical resection from 1991 through 2001 were reviewed. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Case series	Prognostic factors were evaluated using log-rank test and Cox regression. Mean followup period was 34 months. Results: Eighty-two patients met study inclusion criteria. Median patient age was 65 years (range 86 to 22).
Case series	Fifty-nine (72%) patients had type II tumors and 23 (28%) patients had type III tumors, according to the Siewert classification for gastroesophageal junction tumors.
Case series	Twenty-seven (33%) patients underwent total esophagectomy, 24 (29%) patients underwent extended gastrectomy with thoracotomy, and 31 (38%) patients underwent extended gastrectomy without thoracotomy. Overall postoperative 5-year survival rate was 30%.
Case series	On multivariate analysis, patient age 65 years and older, absence of lymph node metastasis, and R0 resection emerged as factors independently associated with improved postoperative survival.
Case series	Frequency with which proximal resection margin was infiltrated with cancer was a function of gross margin length and T stage.
Case series	Proximal gross margin length of at least 6 cm was required to achieve a microscopically negative proximal margin for T3 and T4 cancers. Conclusions: Achieving R0 resection should be the goal of surgical therapy for the gastric cardial cancer.
Case series	The surgical approach should be tailored to individual patients to achieve this goal.
Case series	Adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia: what is the optimal surgical approach?
Cohort study	Objective: To determine whether the length of esophageal resection or the operative approach influences outcome for patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).
Cohort study	Summary background data: While R0 resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment of patients with GEJ cancer, the optimal length of esophageal resection remains controversial.
Cohort study	Methods: Patients with Siewert I, II, or III adenocarcinoma who underwent complete gross resection without neoadjuvant therapy were identified from a prospectively maintained database.
Cohort study	Proximal margin lengths were recorded ex vivo as the distance from the gross tumor edge to the esophageal transection line. Operative approaches were grouped into gastrectomy (limited esophagectomy) or esophagectomy (extended esophagectomy).
Cohort study	Results: From 1985 through 2003, 505 patients underwent R0/R1 gastrectomy (n = 153) or esophagectomy (n = 352) without neoadjuvant treatment.
Cohort study	There were no differences in R1 resection rate, number of nodes examined or operative mortality between gastrectomy and esophagectomy. Univariate analysis found >3.
Cohort study	8 cm to be the ex vivo proximal margin length (approximately 5 cm in situ) most predictive of improved survival.
Cohort study	Multivariable analysis in patients who underwent R0 resection with >or=15 lymph nodes examined (n = 275) found the number of positive lymph nodes, T stage, tumor grade, and ex vivo proximal margin length >3. 8 cm to be independent prognostic factors.
Cohort study	Subset analysis found that the benefit associated with >3. 8 cm margin was limited to patients with T2 or greater tumors and <or=6 positive lymph nodes.
Cohort study	Conclusions: In patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy, the goal for patients with adenocarcinoma of the GEJ should be R0 resection including at least 15 lymph nodes, preferably with 5 cm of grossly normal in situ proximal esophagus for those with <or=6 positive lymph nodes.
Cohort study	The operative approach may be individualized to achieve these goals.
Cohort study	Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction: influence of esophageal resection margin and operative approach on outcome
randomized controlled trial	Background: Controversy exists about the best surgical treatment for esophageal carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We randomly assigned 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the mid-to-distal esophagus or adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus either to transhiatal esophagectomy or to transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Principal end points were overall survival and disease-free survival. Early morbidity and mortality, the number of quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cost effectiveness were also determined.
randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 106 patients were assigned to undergo transhiatal esophagectomy, and 114 to undergo transthoracic esophagectomy. Demographic characteristics and characteristics of the tumor were similar in the two groups.
randomized controlled trial	Perioperative morbidity was higher after transthoracic esophagectomy, but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (P=0. 45). After a median follow-up of 4.
randomized controlled trial	7 years, 142 patients had died--74 (70 percent) after transhiatal resection and 68 (60 percent) after transthoracic resection (P=0. 12).
randomized controlled trial	Although the difference in survival was not statistically significant, there was a trend toward a survival benefit with the extended approach at five years: disease-free survival was 27 percent in the transhiatal-esophagectomy group, as compared with 39 percent in the transthoracic-esophagectomy group (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1 to 24 percent [the negative value indicates better survival with transhiatal resection]), whereas overall survival was 29 percent as compared with 39 percent (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -3 to 23 percent).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Transhiatal esophagectomy was associated with lower morbidity than transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Although median overall, disease-free, and quality-adjusted survival did not differ statistically between the groups, there was a trend toward improved long-term survival at five years with the extended transthoracic approach.
randomized controlled trial	Extended transthoracic resection compared with limited transhiatal resection for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Background: Because of the inaccessibility of mediastinal nodal metastases, the left thoracoabdominal approach (LTA) has often been used to treat gastric cancer of the cardia or subcardia.
randomized controlled trial	In a randomised phase III study, we aimed to compare LTA with the abdominal-transhiatal approach (TH) in the treatment of these tumours.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Between July, 1995, and December, 2003, 167 patients were enrolled from 27 Japanese hospitals and randomly assigned to TH (n=82) or LTA (n=85).
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, postoperative morbidity and hospital mortality, and postoperative symptoms and change of respiratory function. The projected sample size was 302.
randomized controlled trial	After the first interim analysis, the predicted probability of LTA having a significantly better overall survival than TH at the final analysis was only 3. 65%, and the trial was closed immediately. Analysis was by intention to treat.
randomized controlled trial	This study is registered with , number NCT00149266. Findings: 5-year overall survival was 52. 3% (95% CI 40. 4-64. 1) in the TH group and 37. 9% (26. 1-49. 6) in the LTA group. The hazard ratio of death for LTA compared with TH was 1. 36 (0. 89-2.
randomized controlled trial	08, p=0. 92). Three patients died in hospital after LTA but none after TH. Morbidity was worse after LTA than after TH.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Because LTA does not improve survival after TH and leads to increased morbidity in patients with cancer of the cardia or subcardia, LTA cannot be justified to treat these tumours.

review	This chapter summarizes the surgical strategies for adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus, gastric cardia, and subcardial gastric cancer invading the cardia+/-distal esophagus known as adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (AEG).
review	The different surgical approaches according to the tumor origin, localization, and tumor stage are addressed with particular attention to the extent and type of resection and appropriate lymphadenectomy (LAD).
review	The classification of AEG according to Siewert is helpful for the selection of the surgical strategy.
review	While type I tumors benefit from a transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy including a two-field LAD, type II and III tumors can be treated by an extended total gastrectomy with a transhiatal resection of the distal esophagus and LAD of the lower mediastinum and the abdominal D2 compartment.
review	Limited resections appear to be -possible for early tumor stages in selected cases of type I-III tumors.
review	Surgical strategies for adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction
randomized controlled trial	Background: The optimal surgical approach for treatment of oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) cancer is controversial.
randomized controlled trial	A randomized clinical trial (JCOG9502) comparing transhiatal (TH) and left thoracoabdominal (LTA) approaches was stopped after the first interim analysis owing to limited efficacy for LTA resections. Complete 10-year follow-up data are now available.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the OGJ or gastric cardia with oesophageal invasion of 3 cm or less were randomized to a TH or LTA approach.
randomized controlled trial	Both groups underwent total gastrectomy and splenectomy with D2 nodal dissection plus para-aortic lymphadenectomy above the left renal vein. For LTA, a thorough mediastinal lymphadenectomy below the left inferior pulmonary vein was also mandatory.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival. Results: A total of 167 patients (82 TH, 85 LTA) were enrolled. The 10-year overall survival rate was 37 (95 per cent c. i.
randomized controlled trial	26 to 47) per cent for the TH approach and 24 (15 to 34) per cent for the LTA technique (P = 0·060). The hazard ratio for death was 1·42 (0·98 to 2·05) for the LTA technique.
randomized controlled trial	Subgroup analysis based on the Siewert classification indicated non-significant survival advantages in favour of the TH approach. Conclusion: LTA resections should be avoided in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the OGJ or gastric cardia.

review	Esophageal cancer represents a major public health problem worldwide.
review	Several minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) techniques have been described and represent a safe alternative for the surgical management of esophageal cancer in selected centers with high volume and expertise in them.
review	This article reviews the most recent and largest series evaluating MIE techniques. Recent larger series have shown MIE to be equivalent in postoperative morbidity and mortality rates to conventional surgery.
review	MIE has been associated with less blood loss, less postoperative pain, and decreased intensive care unit and hospital length of stay compared with conventional surgery.
review	Despite limited data, conventional surgery and MIE have shown no significant difference in survival, stage for stage. The myriad of MIE techniques complicates the debate of defining the optimal surgical approach for treating esophageal cancer.
review	Randomized controlled trials comparing MIE with conventional open esophagectomy are needed to clarify the ideal procedure with the lowest postoperative morbidity, best quality of life after surgery, and long-term survival.
review	Minimally invasive surgery for esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: To evaluate whether thoracoscopic and video-assisted dissections are appropriate modalities, we assessed the mortality, morbidity, and survival of patients who underwent a thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: Between November 1995 and December 2004, thoracoscopic and video-assisted esophagectomies were performed on 112 (72. 7%) patients out of 154 who underwent surgical resection for thoracic and abdominal esophageal cancer.
Case series	The histologic type of cancer was squamous cell carcinoma in 109 (97. 4%) patients and adenocarcinoma in 3 (2. 6%). Results: Intraoperative complications occurred in 4 (3. 6%) patients: tracheal injury in 3 (2. 7%) and azygos vein injury in 1 (0. 8%).
Case series	The 30-day mortality rate was 0. 8%. Early postoperative complications occurred in 29 (25. 9%) patients including the following: recurrent nerve palsy in 10 (8. 9%), respiratory complication in 7 (6. 3%), anastomotic leakage in 9 (8.
Case series	0%) with major leakage requiring reanastomosis in 4 (3. 6%) of these 9, and chylothorax in 3 (2. 7%). Induction chemoradiotherapy, preoperative concomitant disease, and reconstruction using the colon did not increase morbidity.
Case series	Port site recurrence occurred in 3 (2. 7%) patients. The overall 5-year survival rate was 52%. For stage I disease, the 5-year survival rate of patients was 87. 2%. In stage II disease, it was 70. 2%.
Case series	Conclusions: Thoracoscopic and video-assisted esophagectomy are considered feasible and safe options for the treatment of esophageal cancer, but further investigation is necessary.
Case series	The survival of patients with stage I and II disease is satisfactory at the present time.
Case series	Minimally invasive esophagectomy for stage I and II esophageal cancer
Cohort study	Background: A direct comparison of open operation and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for radical oesophagectomy has yet to be published.
Cohort study	Methods: Medical records of 149 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent oesophagectomy and three-field lymphadenectomy were reviewed.
Cohort study	Seventy-seven patients had the thoracic procedure performed via a 5-cm minithoracotomy and four ports (VATS group); the others were operated on by conventional posterolateral thoracotomy (open group).
Cohort study	Results: The mean number of retrieved mediastinal nodes, blood loss and morbidity were similar in the VATS and open groups (33. 9 versus 32. 8 nodes, 284 versus 310 g, and 32 versus 38 per cent respectively).
Cohort study	The thoracic procedure took longer in patients having VATS than in the control group (227 versus 186 min; P = 0. 031). Vital capacity reduction was less with VATS than in the open group (15 versus 22 per cent; P = 0. 016).
Cohort study	The 3- and 5-year survival rates were similar: 70 and 55 per cent respectively for VATS compared with 60 and 57 per cent for the open procedure. Conclusion: VATS provides comparable results to open radical oesophagectomy, with less surgical trauma.
Cohort study	A comparison of video-assisted thoracoscopic oesophagectomy and radical lymph node dissection for squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus with open operation
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO; thoracoscopy, laparoscopy, cervical anastomosis) is a complex procedure and few substantial series have been published.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This study documented the morbidity, mortality and challenges of adopting MIO in a specialist unit in the UK. Methods: A prospective group of 77 patients was listed consecutively with the intention of performing MIO.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Three other patients underwent open oesophagectomy during the study period.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: MIO was attempted in 77 patients, completed successfully in 70, abandoned in six patients (8 per cent) with unsuspected metastatic disease, and converted to a thoracoscopic anastomosis in one patient.
Non-randomized controlled trial	There was one in-hospital death (1 per cent). Complications occurred in 33 patients (47 per cent), including nine gastric conduit-related complications (13 per cent). Median lymph node harvest was 21 (range 7-48) nodes.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Mean overall and disease-free survival times were 35 and 33 months respectively. Median disease-free survival for patients with stage III disease was 26 months.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: MIO can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates in an unselected series of patients. There was more morbidity related to gastric tube ischaemia than was expected.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Short-term outcomes following total minimally invasive oesophagectomy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Introduction: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) can reduce surgical aggression and cardiopulmonary complications while maintaining basic oncological principles.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We present the results of our initial experience with this technique in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Patients and method: Fifty patients with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer were selected to undergo MIE.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In 18 patients the tumour was located in supracarinal esophagus, in 24 in subcarinal esophagus and in 8 patients in the cardial region.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The surgical procedures were: three-field esophagectomy (laparoscopy, thoracostomy and cervicotomy), transhiatal esophagectomy and Ivor Lewis procedure (thoracoscopy and laparoscopy).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: The laparoscopy approach was used in 48 patients and 13 by the thoracoscopy approach. Transhiatal esophagectomy was performed on 13 patients. The mean duration of intervention was 281 minutes. Morbidity was 48% and mortality was 8%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The mean hospital stay was 13. 2 days. Survival analysis showed: 82% in stage I, 38% in stage II and 24% in stage III. The mean follow-up was 19 months.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Minimally invasive techniques to resect the esophagus in patients with cancer were confirmed to be safe and comparable to an open approach with respect to postoperative recovery and cancer survival.
Non-randomized controlled trial	[Transthoracic and transhiatal esophagectomy using minimally invasive techniques. Experience in 50 patients]
meta analysis	Introduction: Open esophagectomy for cancer is a major oncological procedure, associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
meta analysis	Recently, thoracoscopic procedures have offered a potentially advantageous alternative because of less operative trauma compared with thoracotomy.
meta analysis	The aim of this study was to utilize meta-analysis to compare outcomes of open esophagectomy with those of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) and hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (HMIE).
meta analysis	Methods: Literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for comparative studies assessing different techniques of esophagectomy.
meta analysis	A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed. Primary outcomes of interest were 30-day mortality and anastomotic leak.
meta analysis	Secondary outcomes included operative outcomes, other postoperative outcomes, and oncological outcomes in terms of lymph nodes retrieved. Results: A total of 12 studies were included in the analysis.
meta analysis	Studies included a total of 672 patients for MIE and HMIE, and 612 for open esophagectomy.
meta analysis	There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality; however, MIE had lower blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and reduced total morbidity and respiratory complications.
meta analysis	For all other outcomes, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is a safe alternative to the open technique.
meta analysis	Patients undergoing MIE may benefit from shorter hospital stay, and lower respiratory complications and total morbidity compared with open esophagectomy.
meta analysis	Multicenter, prospective large randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings in order to base practice on sound clinical evidence.
meta analysis	Is minimally invasive surgery beneficial in the management of esophageal cancer? A meta-analysis
meta analysis	Objective: To use meta-analysis to compare oncologic outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) with open techniques (thoracoscopic and/or laparoscopic).
meta analysis	Analysis includes the extent of lymph node (LN) clearance, number of LNs retrieved, staging, geographic variance, and mortality.
meta analysis	Data sources: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases (1950-2012).
meta analysis	We evaluated all comparative studies. Study selection: All eligible published studies with adequate oncologic data comparing MIE with open resection for carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction.
meta analysis	Data extraction: Two investigators independently selected studies for inclusion and exclusion by article abstraction and quality assessment.
meta analysis	Data synthesis: After careful review, we included 16 case-control studies with 1212 patients undergoing esophagectomy. The median (range) number of LNs found in the MIE and open groups were 16 (5. 7-33. 9) and 10 (3. 0-32.
meta analysis	8), respectively, with a significant difference favoring MIE (P =. 04). In comparing LN retrieval in Eastern vs Western studies, we found a significant difference in Western centers favoring MIE (P <. 001).
meta analysis	No statistical significance in pathologic staging was found between the open and MIE groups.
meta analysis	Generally, no statistically significant difference was found between the open and MIE groups for survival within each time interval (30 days and 1, 2, 3, and 5 years), although the difference favored the MIE group.
meta analysis	In comparing survival outcomes in Eastern vs Western centers, a nonsignificant survival advantage (across all time intervals) was found for MIE in the Eastern (P =. 28) and Western (P =. 44) centers.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is a viable alternative to open techniques. Meta-analytic evidence finds equivalent oncologic outcomes to conventional open esophagectomy.
meta analysis	Evidence to support the use of minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis
Cohort study	Objective: To compare short-term outcomes of open and minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) for cancer. Background data: Numerous studies have demonstrated the safety and possible advantages of MIE in selected cohorts of patients.
Cohort study	The increasing use of MIE is not coupled with conclusive evidence of its benefits over "open" esophagectomy, especially in the absence of randomized trials. Methods: Hospital Episode Statistics data were analyzed from April 2005 to March 2010.
Cohort study	This is a routinely collected database of all English National Health Service Trusts.
Cohort study	Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures, 4th revision (OPCS-4), procedure codes were used to identify index resections and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), diagnostic codes were used to ascertain comorbidity status and complications.
Cohort study	Thirty-day in-hospital mortality, medical complications, and surgical reinterventions were analyzed. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted regression analyses were undertaken.
Cohort study	Results: Seven thousand five hundred and two esophagectomies were undertaken; of these, 1155 (15. 4%) were MIE. In 2009-2010, 24. 7% of resections were MIE. There was no difference in 30-day mortality (4. 3% vs 4. 0%; P = 0.
Cohort study	605) and overall medical morbidity (38. 0% vs 39. 2%; P = 0. 457) rates between open and MIE groups, respectively. A higher reintervention rate was associated with the MIE group than with the open group (21% vs 17. 6%, P = 0. 006; odds ratio, 1.
Cohort study	17; 95% confidence interval, 1. 00-1. 38; P = 0. 040). Conclusions: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is increasingly performed in the United Kingdom.
Cohort study	Although the study confirmed the safety of MIE in a population-based national data, there are no significant benefits demonstrated in mortality and overall morbidity. Minimally invasive esophagectomy is associated with higher reintervention rate.
Cohort study	Further evidence is needed to establish the long-term survival of MIE.
Cohort study	Short-term outcomes following open versus minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer in England: a population-based national study
meta analysis	Objective: Evaluate the existing literature comparing long-term survival after minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) and open esophagectomy (OE), and conduct a meta-analysis based on relevant studies.
meta analysis	Background: It is unknown whether the choice between MIE and OE influences the long-term survival in esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: A systematic electronic search for articles was performed in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for studies comparing long-term survival after MIE and OE. Additionally, an extensive hand-search was conducted.
meta analysis	The I test and χ test were used to test for statistical heterogeneity. Publication bias and small-study effects were assessed using Egger test.
meta analysis	A random-effects meta-analysis was performed for all-cause 5-year (main outcome) and 3-year mortality, and disease-specific 5-year and 3-year mortality.
meta analysis	Meta-regression was performed for the 5-year mortality outcomes with adjustment for the covariates age, physical status, tumor stage, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
meta analysis	The results were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The review identified 55 relevant studies. Among all 14,592 patients, 7358 (50. 4%) underwent MIE and 7234 (49. 6%) underwent OE.
meta analysis	The statistical heterogeneity was limited [I = 12%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0%-41%, and χ = 0. 26] and the funnel plot was symmetrical both according to visual and statistical testing (Egger test = 0. 32).
meta analysis	Pooled analysis revealed 18% lower 5-year all-cause mortality after MIE compared with OE (HR 0. 82, 95% CI 0. 76-0. 88). The meta-regression indicated no confounding.
meta analysis	Conclusions: The long-term survival after MIE compares well with OE and may even be better. Thus, MIE can be recommended as a standard surgical approach for esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Long-term Survival in Esophageal Cancer After Minimally Invasive Compared to Open Esophagectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Cohort study	Background: Our objective was to determine how surgical approach impacts overall survival and postoperative outcomes when comparing robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE), minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE), and open esophagectomy (OE).
Cohort study	Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with pathologic Stage 0 to III esophageal cancer from 2010 to 2015.
Cohort study	Primary outcome measures evaluated were length of stay, 30-day unplanned readmissions, mortality rates at 30 and 90 days, and overall survival rates.
Cohort study	The surgical cohorts underwent 1:1 propensity score matching, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were compared by surgical approach. Cox proportional hazards regression was utilized to estimate factors associated with overall survival.
Cohort study	Results: Of 5,553 patients that met criteria, 28. 4% were MIE, 7. 8% RAMIE, and 63. 8% OE. From 2010 to 2015, an increasing trend was seen for both minimally invasive approaches, with MIE surpassing the number of OEs.
Cohort study	Unplanned 30-day readmissions and 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were not significantly different between the different groups.
Cohort study	Median length of stay was significantly shorter in MIE (9 [interquartile range (IQR), 8 to 14] days) and RAMIE (9 [IQR, 7 to 14] days), compared with OE (10 [IQR, 8 to 15] days; p < 0. 001).
Cohort study	MIE and RAMIE had comparable survival rates compared with OE, with no significant differences in median overall survival estimates after propensity score matching (log-rank p = 0.
Cohort study	603), with a trend for increased survival in MIE (adjusted hazard ratio, 0. 97; 95% confidence interval, 0. 89 to 1. 06; p = 0. 530) and RAMIE (hazard ratio, 0. 81; 95% confidence interval, 0. 69 to 0. 95; p = 0. 012).
Cohort study	Both minimally invasive approaches had a significantly higher median lymph node counts (MIE: 15 [IQR, 9 to 22]; RAMIE: 17 [IQR, 11 to 24]; OE: 13 [IQR, 8 to 20]), which may highlight important differences in postoperative upstaging.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Trends in MIE use is surpassing the open approach. Minimally invasive approaches are becoming the preferred approach, with noninferior long-term results compared with OEs.
Cohort study	A significantly higher lymph node yield was seen for RAMIE and MIE.
Cohort study	Does the Approach Matter? Comparing Survival in Robotic, Minimally Invasive, and Open Esophagectomies
Cohort study	Background: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is rapidly emerging as a suitable surgical alternative to the open technique.
Cohort study	This retrospective comparative study aimed to compare two minimally invasive techniques for esophagectomy: transhiatal laparoscopy with intrathoracic or cervical anastomosis (group A) and right thoracoscopy in prone position followed by laparoscopy and left cervicotomy (group B) performed by the same surgeon (G.
Cohort study	B. C. ). The operative time, perioperative blood loss, intensive care and total hospital stays, peri- and postoperative morbidity, in-hospital mortality, number of lymph nodes dissected, and survival were the outcome measures.
Cohort study	Methods: Between April 1999 and August 2005, 24 patients (group A) and 15 patients (group B) underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer in the authors' department. Their median age was 61 years in group A and 61 years in group B.
Cohort study	Preoperatively, the endoscopic location of the tumor was in the upper third in 2 cases (1 vs 1), the middle third in 11 cases (7 vs 4), and the lower third in 26 cases (16 vs 10).
Cohort study	Two patients in each group received neoadjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy. One patient (group A) and two patients (group B) received only neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and three patients (group A) received only neoadjuvant radiotherapy.
Cohort study	Results: The median operative time was 300 min (range, 240-420 min) in group A and 377 min (range, 240-540 min) in group B (nonsignificant difference [NS]).
Cohort study	The median perioperative bleeding was 325 ml (range, 100-800 ml) in group A and 700 ml (range, 100-2,400 ml) in group B (NS). The perioperative complications included one splenectomy in each group and one conversion to thoracotomy in group B.
Cohort study	The postoperative medical complications totaled three in group A and six in group B.
Cohort study	The postoperative surgical complications included one hemoperitoneum, one pneumothorax, five anastomotic leaks, and two recurrent laryngeal nerve paralyses in group A and two tracheal necroses, four anastomotic leaks, one colic fistula, and three recurrent laryngeal nerve paralyses in group B.
Cohort study	The median intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 5 days (range, 2-70 days) for group A and 5 days (range, 1-180 days) for group B (NS).
Cohort study	The median hospital stay was 12 days (range, 7-98 days) for group A and 14 days (range, 7-480 days) for group B (p = 0. 05). The early mortality rate was 0%. All the specimens were free of disease.
Cohort study	The median number of mediastinal/periesophageal lymph nodes was 3 (range, 1-10) for group A and 4 (range, 2-13) for group B (NS), and the median number of celiac/perigastric lymph nodes was 11 (range, 2-31) for group A and 10 (range, 3-22) for group B (NS).
Cohort study	After a median follow-up period of 42. 4 months (range, 2-84 months) for group A and 19. 1 months (range, 1.
Cohort study	5-34 months) for group B, 12 patients in group A died after a median period of 22 months (range, 2-55 months), and 7 patients in group B died after a median time of 15 months (range, 1. 5-23 months).
Cohort study	Conclusions: This retrospective comparative study showed that minimally invasive esophagectomy performed by thoracoscopy in the prone position is comparable with laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy in terms of the significant postoperative and survival outcomes.
Cohort study	Minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer: laparoscopic transhiatal procedure or thoracoscopy in prone position followed by laparoscopy?
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy is a technically demanding operation with high procedure-related morbidity and mortality rates. Minimally invasive techniques were introduced in the late 1980s in an effort to decrease the invasiveness of the procedure.
Case series	Data concerning the use of robotic systems for esophageal cancer are scarce in the literature. The goal of this report is to describe the authors' early experience using robotically assisted technology to perform transhiatal esophagectomy (RATE).
Case series	Methods: Between September 2001 and May 2004, 18 patients underwent RATE at the authors' institution. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed.
Case series	Gender, age, postoperative diagnosis, operative time, conversion rate, blood loss, hospital stay, length of the follow-up period, and complications were assessed.
Case series	Results: At the authors' institution, 18 patients underwent RATE, including 16 men (89%), with a mean age of 54 years (range, 41-73 years). The RATE procedure was completed for all 18 patients (100%).
Case series	The mean operative time was 267 +/- 71 min, and estimated blood loss was 54 ml (range, 10-150 ml). The mean intensive care unit stay was 1. 8 days (range, 1-5 days), and the mean hospital stay was 10 days (range, 4-38 days).
Case series	A total of 12 perioperative complications occurred for 9 patients, including 6 anastomotic leaks, 1 thoracic duct injury, 1 vocal cord paralysis, 1 pleural effusion, and 2 atrial fibrillations. Anastomotic stricture was observed in six patients.
Case series	There were no perioperative deaths. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen yielded an average of 14 lymph nodes per patient (range, 7-27).
Case series	During the mean follow-up period of 22 +/- 8 months, 2 patients died, 2 were lost to follow-up evaluation, 3 had recurrence, and 11 were disease free.
Case series	Conclusion: The current study shows that RATE, with its decreased blood loss, minimal cardiopulmonary complications, and no hospital mortality, represents a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Robotically assisted laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy
Cohort study	Background: Surgical treatment of esophageal cancer is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality even in specialized centers. Minimally invasive surgery has been proposed to decrease these complications.
Cohort study	Methods: The authors present their results regarding postoperative complications and the survival rate at 3 years, comparing the classic open procedures (transthoracic or transhiatal esophagectomy) with minimally invasive surgery.
Cohort study	Surgical procedures were performed according to procedures published elsewhere. Results: The study enrolled 166 patients who underwent surgery between 1990 and 2003. Open transthoracic surgery was performed for 60 patients.
Cohort study	In this group of patients, postoperative mortality was observed in 11% of the cases. Major, minor, and late complications were observed in 61. 6% of the patients, and the 3-year survival rate was 30% for this group.
Cohort study	Open transhiatal surgery was performed for 59 patients. The morbidity, mortality, and 3-year rate were almost the same as for the transthoracic surgery group.
Cohort study	For the 47 patients submitted to minimally invasive procedures (thoracoscopic and laparoscopic), the complications and mortality rates were significantly reduced (38. 2% and 6. 4%, respectively).
Cohort study	For the patients submitted to minimally invasive surgery, the 3-year survival rate was 45. 4%.
Cohort study	It is important to clarify that the patients submitted to minimally invasive surgery manifested early stages of the diseases, and that this the reason why the morbimortality and survival rates were better.
Cohort study	Conclusions: The transthoracic and transhiatal open approaches have similar early and late results. Minimally invasive surgery is an option for patients with esophageal carcinoma, with reported results similar to those for open surgery.
Cohort study	This approach is indicated mainly for selected patients with early stages of the disease.
Cohort study	Open transthoracic or transhiatal esophagectomy versus minimally invasive esophagectomy in terms of morbidity, mortality and survival
Case series	Background: Traditional esophagectomy may be associated with mortality, considerable morbidity, and lengthy recovery.
Case series	It is often performed in cancer patients who are typically older, have associated comorbidities, and are often malnourished, all factors that increase surgical risk.
Case series	Minimally invasive esophagectomy has the potential advantages of being a less traumatic procedure with an easier postoperative recovery and fewer wound and pulmonary complications.
Case series	Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy was performed. Assessed parameters included patient demographics and operative data, pathology results, and long-term follow-up of at least 12 months.
Case series	Results: Twenty-two patients underwent laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy; 19 had esophageal cancer. Two patients were operated on for Barrett esophagus, and 1 patient had achalasia.
Case series	The majority of patients were men (82%), and the mean age was 59 years (range 15 to 74 years); 1 patient (4. 5%) was converted to open surgery.
Case series	The average operative time was 380 minutes (range 285 to 525 minutes), and the average blood loss was 220 mL; only 3 patients required transfusion. The median hospital stay was 8 days (range 5 to 46 days).
Case series	Postoperative mortality occurred in 1 patient (4. 5%), and postoperative complications developed in 6 patients (27. 2%). In the 19 cancer patients, the average number of harvested nodes was 14. 3 (range 10 to 19).
Case series	The average follow-up was 30 months (range 12 to 48 months). The overall survival for cancer patients was 61% (11 of 19), and disease-free survival was 39% (7/19).
Case series	Conclusions: Esophagectomy is a major surgery with considerable morbidity and potential mortality. Minimally invasive esophagectomy is a feasible approach that can be safely performed by surgeons with extensive experience in that field.
Case series	Advantages include less intraoperative blood loss, a smaller incision, and a potentially faster postoperative recovery.
Case series	In cancer patients, immediate oncologic goals of adequate margins and lymph node dissection can be achieved, and long-term outcome appears to be similar to that found with open approaches.
Case series	Laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy for esophageal cancer
Case series	Objective: To assess our outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). Summary background data: Esophagectomy has traditionally been performed by open methods.
Case series	Results from most series include mortality rates in excess of 5% and hospital stays frequently greater than 10 days. MIE has the potential to improve these results, but only a few small series have been reported.
Case series	This report summarizes our experience of 222 cases. Methods: From 1996 to 2002, MIE was performed in 222 patients. Indications for operation included high-grade dysplasia (n = 47) and cancer (n = 175). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used in 78 (35.
Case series	1%) and radiation in 36 (16. 2%). Initially, a laparoscopic transhiatal approach was used (n = 8), but subsequently our approach evolved to include thoracoscopic mobilization (n = 214). Results: There were 186 men and 36 women. Median age was 66.
Case series	5 years (range, 39-89). Nonemergent conversion to open procedure was required in 16 patients (7. 2%). MIE was successfully completed in 206 (92. 8%) patients.
Case series	The median intensive care unit stay was 1 day (range, 1-30); hospital stay was 7 days (range, 3-75). Operative mortality was 1. 4% (n = 3). Anastomotic leak rate was 11. 7% (n = 26).
Case series	At a mean follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-68), quality of life scores were similar to preoperative values and population norms. Stage specific survival was similar to open series.
Case series	Conclusions: MIE offers results as good as or better than open operation in our center with extensive minimally invasive and open experience. In this single institution experience, we observed a lower mortality rate (1.
Case series	4%) and shorter hospital stay (7 days) than most open series. Given these results, we are now developing an intergroup trial (ECOG 2202) to assess MIE in a multicenter setting.
Case series	Minimally invasive esophagectomy: outcomes in 222 patients
Cohort study	Background: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been performed at specialized centers for 15 years, but few studies have looked at outcomes in patients with locally advanced cancers, and few studies have provided long-term survival comparison with Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (ILE) to determine oncologic benefit or equivalence of MIE.
Cohort study	Hypothesis: Minimally invasive esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal carcinoma has similar oncologic outcomes to traditional open ILE with less associated short-term morbidity and mortality.
Cohort study	Design: Retrospective comparison of patients with stage II or III esophageal carcinoma undergoing 3-field MIE compared with open ILE. Setting: University medical center.
Cohort study	Patients: From 1995 to 2009, 64 patients who underwent MIE (33 patients) or ILE (31 patients) with clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer were compared.
Cohort study	Main outcome measures: Primary end points included operative performance, morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and survival. Results: No differences were noted between the groups in demographics, neoadjuvant therapy use (P =.
Cohort study	22), resection completeness (R0:R1) (P =. 57), length of stay (P =. 59), intensive care unit stay (P =. 36), anastomotic leak (P = 1. 0), pulmonary morbidity (P =. 26), and mortality (P = 1. 0).
Cohort study	Median follow-up was 19 months for MIE and 17 months for ILE. Survival at 2 years was 55% for MIE (18 of 33 patients) and 32% for ILE (10 of 31 patients) while disease-free survival was 55% for MIE (18) and 26% for ILE (8).
Cohort study	Conclusions: Our survival analysis shows divergent curves that favor MIE but have not yet reached statistical significance. The oncologic outcomes of MIE are comparable to that of ILE 2 years after resection.
Cohort study	Minimally invasive esophagectomy provides equivalent oncologic outcomes to open esophagectomy for locally advanced (stage II or III) esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy is a complex operation and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to lower morbidity, we have adopted a minimally invasive approach to esophagectomy.
Case series	Objectives: Our primary objective was to evaluate the outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) in a large group of patients.
Case series	Our secondary objective was to compare the modified McKeown minimally invasive approach (videothoracoscopic surgery, laparoscopy, neck anastomosis [MIE-neck]) with our current approach, a modified Ivor Lewis approach (laparoscopy, videothoracoscopic surgery, chest anastomosis [MIE-chest]).
Case series	Methods: We reviewed 1033 consecutive patients undergoing MIE. Elective operation was performed on 1011 patients; 22 patients with nonelective operations were excluded. Patients were stratified by surgical approach and perioperative outcomes analyzed.
Case series	The primary endpoint studied was 30-day mortality. Results: The MIE-neck was performed in 481 (48%) and MIE-Ivor Lewis in 530 (52%). Patients undergoing MIE-Ivor Lewis were operated in the current era. The median number of lymph nodes resected was 21.
Case series	The operative mortality was 1. 68%. Median length of stay (8 days) and ICU stay (2 days) were similar between the 2 approaches. Mortality rate was 0. 9%, and recurrent nerve injury was less frequent in the Ivor Lewis MIE group (P < 0. 001).
Case series	Conclusions: MIE in our center resulted in acceptable lymph node resection, postoperative outcomes, and low mortality using either an MIE-neck or an MIE-chest approach.
Case series	The MIE Ivor Lewis approach was associated with reduced recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and mortality of 0. 9% and is now our preferred approach. Minimally invasive esophagectomy can be performed safely, with good results in an experienced center.
Case series	Outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy: review of over 1000 patients
randomized controlled trial	Background: Surgical resection is regarded as the only curative option for resectable oesophageal cancer, but pulmonary complications occurring in more than half of patients after open oesophagectomy are a great concern.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether minimally invasive oesophagectomy reduces morbidity compared with open oesophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at five study centres in three countries between June 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18-75 years with resectable cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive either open transthoracic or minimally invasive transthoracic oesophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was stratified by centre. Patients, and investigators undertaking interventions, assessing outcomes, and analysing data, were not masked to group assignment.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome was pulmonary infection within the first 2 weeks after surgery and during the whole stay in hospital. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR TC 2452.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: We randomly assigned 56 patients to the open oesophagectomy group and 59 to the minimally invasive oesophagectomy group.
randomized controlled trial	16 (29%) patients in the open oesophagectomy group had pulmonary infection in the first 2 weeks compared with five (9%) in the minimally invasive group (relative risk [RR] 0·30, 95% CI 0·12-0·76; p=0·005).
randomized controlled trial	19 (34%) patients in the open oesophagectomy group had pulmonary infection in-hospital compared with seven (12%) in the minimally invasive group (0·35, 0·16-0·78; p=0·005).
randomized controlled trial	For in-hospital mortality, one patient in the open oesophagectomy group died from anastomotic leakage and two in the minimally invasive group from aspiration and mediastinitis after anastomotic leakage.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: These findings provide evidence for the short-term benefits of minimally invasive oesophagectomy for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy for patients with oesophageal cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial
randomized controlled trial	Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate 3-year survival following a randomized controlled trial comparing minimally invasive with open esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Background: Research on minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has shown faster postoperative recovery and a marked decrease in pulmonary complications.
randomized controlled trial	Debate is ongoing as to whether the procedure is equivalent to open resection regarding oncologic outcomes. The study is a follow-up study of the TIME-trial (traditional invasive vs minimally invasive esophagectomy, a multicenter, randomized trial).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Between June 2009 and March 2011, patients with a resectable intrathoracic esophageal carcinoma, including the gastroesophageal junction tumors (Siewert I), were randomized between open and MI esophagectomy with curative intent.
randomized controlled trial	Primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, lymph node yield, short-term morbidity, mortality, complications, radicality, local recurrence, and metastasis. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR TC 2452. Both trial protocol and short-term results have been published previously.
randomized controlled trial	Results: One hundred fifteen patients were included from 5 European hospitals and randomly assigned to open (n = 56) or MI esophagectomy (n = 59). Combined overall 3-year survival was 40. 4% (SD 7. 7%) in the open group versus 50.
randomized controlled trial	5% (SD 8%) in the minimally invasive group (P = 0. 207). The hazard ratio (HR) is 0. 883 (0. 540 to 1. 441) for MIE compared with open surgery. Disease-free 3-year survival was 35. 9% (SD 6. 8%) in the open versus 40. 2% (SD 6.
randomized controlled trial	9%) in the MI group [HR 0. 691 (0. 389 to 1. 239). Conclusions: The study presented here depicted no differences in disease-free and overall 3-year survival for open and MI esophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	These results, together with short-term results, further support the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques in the treatment of esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Minimally Invasive Versus Open Esophageal Resection: Three-year Follow-up of the Previously Reported Randomized Controlled Trial: the TIME Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: The standard curative treatment for patients with esophageal cancer is perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by open transthoracic esophagectomy (OTE).
randomized controlled trial	Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy (RAMIE) may reduce complications.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted, assigning 112 patients with resectable intrathoracic esophageal cancer to either RAMIE or OTE.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of overall surgery-related postoperative complications (modified Clavien-Dindo classification grade 2-5).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Overall surgery-related postoperative complications occurred less frequently after RAMIE (59%) compared to OTE (80%) [risk ratio with RAMIE (RR) 0. 74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0. 57-0. 96; P = 0. 02].
randomized controlled trial	RAMIE resulted in less median blood loss (400 vs 568 mL, P <0. 001), a lower percentage of pulmonary complications (RR 0. 54; 95% CI, 0. 34-0. 85; P = 0. 005) and cardiac complications (RR 0. 47; 95% CI, 0. 27-0. 83; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	006) and lower mean postoperative pain (visual analog scale, 1. 86 vs 2. 62; P < 0. 001) compared to OTE. Functional recovery at postoperative day 14 was better in the RAMIE group [RR 1. 48 (95% CI, 1. 03-2. 13; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	038)] with better quality of life score at discharge [mean difference quality of life score 13. 4 (2. 0-24. 7, p = 0. 02)] and 6 weeks postdischarge [mean difference 11. 1 quality of life score (1. 0-21. 1; P = 0. 03)].
randomized controlled trial	Short- and long-term oncological outcomes were comparable at a medium follow-up of 40 months.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: RAMIE resulted in a lower percentage of overall surgery-related and cardiopulmonary complications with lower postoperative pain, better short-term quality of life, and a better short-term postoperative functional recovery compared to OTE.
randomized controlled trial	Oncological outcomes were comparable and in concordance with the highest standards nowadays.
randomized controlled trial	Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Thoracolaparoscopic Esophagectomy Versus Open Transthoracic Esophagectomy for Resectable Esophageal Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial
Cohort study	Background: Both robot-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (RAILE) and conventional thoracoscopic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (TAILE) are minimally invasive surgical techniques for the treatment of middle and distal esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	However, no research studies comparing early outcomes between RAILE and TAILE have been reported.
Cohort study	Methods: A retrospective analysis was made of 184 patients, 76 in the RAILE group and 108 in the TAILE group, who underwent minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy between December 2014 and June 2018.
Cohort study	Propensity score-matched analysis was performed between the two groups based on demographics, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor location, tumor size, and pathological stage. Perioperative outcomes were compared.
Cohort study	Results: Two conversions to thoracotomy occurred in the RAILE group. There was no 30-day in either group. Sixty-six matched pairs were identified for each group.
Cohort study	Within the propensity score-matched cohorts, the operative time in the RAILE group was significantly longer than that in the TAILE group (302. 0 ± 62. 9 vs. 274. 7 ± 38. 0 min, P = 0. 004). There was no significant difference in the blood loss [200.
Cohort study	0 ml (interquartile range [IQR], 100. 0-262. 5 ml) vs. 200. 0 ml (150. 0-245. 0 ml), P = 0. 100], rates of overall complications (28. 8 vs. 24. 2%, P = 0. 554), length of stay [9. 0 days (IQR 8. 0-12. 3 days) vs. 9. 0 days (IQR 8. 0-11.
Cohort study	3 days), P = 0. 517], the number of total dissected lymph nodes (19. 2 ± 9. 2 vs. 19. 3 ± 9. 5, P = 0. 955), and detailed categories of lymph nodes.
Cohort study	Conclusions: RAILE demonstrated comparable early outcomes compared with TAILE and should be considered as an alternative minimally invasive option for treating esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Early Outcomes of Robot-Assisted Versus Thoracoscopic-Assisted Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer: A Propensity Score-Matched Study
Cohort study	Objective: We report patient outcomes from esophageal resection with respect to morbidity and cancer survival comparing open thoracotomy and laparotomy (Open), with a thoracoscopic/laparotomy approach (Thoracoscopic-Assisted) and a total thoracoscopic/laparoscopic approach (Total MIE).
Cohort study	Methods: From a prospective database of all patients managed with cancer of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction, patients who had a resection using one of three techniques were analyzed to assess postoperative variables, adequacy of cancer clearance, and survival.
Cohort study	Results: The number of patients for each procedure was as follows: Open, 114; Thoracoscopic-Assisted, 309; and Total MIE, 23. The groups were comparable with respect to preoperative variables.
Cohort study	The differences in the postoperative variables were: less median blood loss in the Thoracoscopic-Assisted (400 mL) and Total MIE (300 mL) groups versus Open (600 mL); longer time for Total MIE (330 minutes) versus Thoracoscopic-Assisted (285 minutes) and Open (300 minutes); longer median time in hospital for Open (14 days) versus Thoracoscopic-Assisted (13 days), Total MIE (11 days) and less stricture formation in the Open (6.
Cohort study	1%) versus Thoracoscopic-Assisted (21. 6%), Total MIE (36%). There were no differences in lymph node retrieval for each of the approaches. Open had more stage III patients (65. 8%) versus Thoracoscopic-Assisted (34. 4%), Total MIE (52. 1%).
Cohort study	There was no difference in survival when the groups were compared stage for stage for overall median or 3-year survival.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Minimally invasive techniques to resect the esophagus in patients with cancer were confirmed to be safe and comparable to an open approach with respect to postoperative recovery and cancer survival.
Cohort study	Comparison of the outcomes between open and minimally invasive esophagectomy
review	Surgical innovation and pioneering are important for improving patient outcome, but can be associated with learning curves.
review	Although learning curves in surgery are a recognized problem, the impact of surgical learning curves is increasing, due to increasing complexity of innovative surgical procedures, the rapid rate at which new interventions are implemented and a decrease in relative effectiveness of new interventions compared to old interventions.
review	For minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE), there is now robust evidence that implementation can lead to significant learning associated morbidity (morbidity during a learning curve, that could have been avoided if patients were operated by surgeons that have completed the learning curve).
review	This article provides an overview of the evidence of the impact of learning curves after implementation of MIE.
review	In addition, caveats for implementation and available evidence regarding factors that are important for safe implementation and safe pioneering of MIE are discussed.
review	Learning curves in minimally invasive esophagectomy
Case series	Objective: Esophagectomy is associated with major morbidity.
Case series	In this study we sought to assess the learning curve of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIILE) and to evaluate perioperative outcomes, including anastomotic leak and hospital readmission, as a function of graduated surgeon experience.
Case series	Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic medical records of patients who underwent MIILE, performed by a single surgeon over an 8-year period (2009-2017).
Case series	Primary outcomes were 5-year overall survival, postoperative complications, and 90-day readmission rates. Surgeon experience was divided into 4 quartiles, representing graduated experience.
Case series	Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, whereas Kaplan-Meier estimators were used to assess survival outcomes.
Case series	Results: A total of 170 patients underwent MIILE and were analyzed after exclusion criteria were applied. Five-year overall survival was 50. 1% (95% confidence interval, 39. 7%-63. 2%). Mortality at 90 days was 3. 9% (95% confidence interval, 0. 8%-6.
Case series	9%). Major complications occurred in 25. 3% (n = 43) and 25. 9% (n = 44) were readmitted to the hospital within 90 days after surgery. Conversion to open surgery, anastomotic leaks, and readmissions decreased over time.
Case series	Conclusions: MIILE can be performed safely and effectively with improving results as the surgeon's experience evolves.
Case series	Ivor Lewis minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: An excellent operation that improves with experience
Cohort study	Background: Minimal access surgery is an alternative to open surgery in esophageal surgery. Its role in cancer resection is controversial. Methods: Thoracoscopic esophageal resection was attempted in 22 patients who had increased operative risk.
Cohort study	Postoperative outcomes of these patients were compared with the outcomes of 63 patients who underwent open thoracotomy resection during the same period. Results: Thoracoscopy was completed in 18 patients.
Cohort study	Conversion to thoracotomy was necessary because of locally advanced tumor in three patients, and a bypass procedure was performed in another patient because of poor ventilation during thoracoscopy and the finding of metastatic disease.
Cohort study	The median thoracoscopy time was 110 minutes (range, 55 to 165 minutes). The total operating times were 240 minutes (range, 165 to 360 minutes) and 250 minutes (range, 190 to 420 minutes) for thoracoscopy and thoracotomy, respectively, p = 0. 5.
Cohort study	Blood loss was significantly less than that of open resection; medians were 450 ml (range, 200 to 800 ml) and 700 ml (range, 300 to 2500 ml) for thoracoscopy and thoracotomy, respectively, p < 0. 01.
Cohort study	The median number of lymph nodes removed at thoracoscopy was 7 (range, 2 to 13) compared with 13 (range, 5 to 34) in the thoracotomy group. Bronchopneumonia affected 17% of both groups of patients.
Cohort study	Only one patient who was converted to open thoracotomy died. Port site recurrence developed in one patient. Overall survival rates were not significantly different. Conclusions: Thoracoscopic esophageal resection was a feasible option.
Cohort study	Clear advantages over open thoracotomy were not demonstrated, although patients who were selected for thoracoscopy had worse performance status. This technique deserves further investigation in dedicated centers.
Cohort study	Thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objective: Total esophagectomy with en bloc mediastinal lymphadenectomy for cancer carries a substantial morbidity and mortality rate. To investigate the feasibility of thoracoscopic technique, we carried out an extensive laboratory study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Encouraged by our excellent results, we conducted a clinical trial.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: From September 1994 to September 1995, 39 patients thoracic esophageal cancer lesions not invading surrounding organs underwent total esophagectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy by means of thoracoscopy. Ages ranged from 47 to 86 years.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The procedures were conventional except for the thoracic portion, which was performed as a thoracoscopic procedure with six trocar holes instead of thoracotomy. All harvested lymph nodes were counted for each station.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Spirometric data and plethysmographically determined vital capacity were measured before and after operation for all patients. Results: All procedures were accomplished as scheduled, and none was converted to open thoracotomy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The operating time was 200 +/- 41 minutes (mean +/- standard deviation). Estimated blood loss was 270 +/- 157 ml. The harvested lymph nodes numbered 19. 7 +/- 11. 1 per patient. Seventeen patients (45%) had positive lymph nodes.
Non-randomized controlled trial	There were no in-hospital deaths within 30 days. Twenty-two patients did not require postoperative ventilatory support.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Vital capacity decreased to 85% +/- 11% of the preoperative values, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second decreased to 82% +/- 16%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Thoracoscopic mediastinal lymphadenectomy is technically feasible, and its completeness is comparable to that of the open technique.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The decline in pulmonary function is significantly less than that seen in our previous experience with the open technique.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thoracoscopic en bloc total esophagectomy with radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy
Case series	Background: Traditionally, esophageal resection has been performed using a thoracotomy to access the intrathoracic esophagus.
Case series	With the aim to avoid the potential morbidity of the open thoracic approach, mobilization of the esophagus under direct vision recently has been described.
Case series	We report our experience at attempting thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus in 162 patients during a 6-year period.
Case series	Methods: Patients with malignancy or end-stage benign disease of the esophagus considered suitable for a three-stage esophagectomy underwent a thoracoscopy with a view to endoscopic mobilization of the esophagus.
Case series	Of the 162 patients in whom the procedure was attempted, it was abandoned in 9 patients (6%), and the procedure was converted to open surgery in 11 patients (7%).
Case series	Results: In the patients whose esophagus was mobilized, the average blood loss was 165 ml, and the average time for the thoracoscopic segment of the surgery was 104 min.
Case series	In the 133 patients who underwent a resection for invasive malignancy, a limited mediastinal nodal dissection retrieved an average of 11 nodes, and the median survival was 29 months. The 30-day mortality was 3. 3% and the in-hospital mortality 5. 3%.
Case series	Conclusions: Thoracoscopic mobilization can be performed safely with satisfactory outcomes in a center performing a large volume of esophageal surgery and possessing advanced endoscopic surgery skills.
Case series	Further assessment of this technique and comparisons with traditional open procedures are needed to assess this approach further as an appropriate oncologic procedure.
Case series	Thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus. A 6 year experience
randomized controlled trial	Background: Postoperative complications, especially pulmonary complications, affect more than half the patients who undergo open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Whether hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy results in lower morbidity than open esophagectomy is unclear.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial involving patients 18 to 75 years of age with resectable cancer of the middle or lower third of the esophagus.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo transthoracic open esophagectomy (open procedure) or hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (hybrid procedure).
randomized controlled trial	Surgical quality assurance was implemented by the credentialing of surgeons, standardization of technique, and monitoring of performance.
randomized controlled trial	Hybrid surgery comprised a two-field abdominal-thoracic operation (also called an Ivor-Lewis procedure) with laparoscopic gastric mobilization and open right thoracotomy.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was intraoperative or postoperative complication of grade II or higher according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (indicating major complication leading to intervention) within 30 days.
randomized controlled trial	Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results: From October 2009 through April 2012, we randomly assigned 103 patients to the hybrid-procedure group and 104 to the open-procedure group.
randomized controlled trial	A total of 312 serious adverse events were recorded in 110 patients.
randomized controlled trial	A total of 37 patients (36%) in the hybrid-procedure group had a major intraoperative or postoperative complication, as compared with 67 (64%) in the open-procedure group (odds ratio, 0. 31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 18 to 0. 55; P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	A total of 18 of 102 patients (18%) in the hybrid-procedure group had a major pulmonary complication, as compared with 31 of 103 (30%) in the open-procedure group.
randomized controlled trial	At 3 years, overall survival was 67% (95% CI, 57 to 75) in the hybrid-procedure group, as compared with 55% (95% CI, 45 to 64) in the open-procedure group; disease-free survival was 57% (95% CI, 47 to 66) and 48% (95% CI, 38 to 57), respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: We found that hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy resulted in a lower incidence of intraoperative and postoperative major complications, specifically pulmonary complications, than open esophagectomy, without compromising overall and disease-free survival over a period of 3 years.

randomized controlled trial	Hybrid Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer
meta analysis	Background: Surgery is the preferred treatment for resectable oesophageal cancers, and can be performed in different ways.
meta analysis	Transhiatal oesophagectomy (oesophagectomy without thoracotomy, with a cervical anastomosis) is one way to resect oesophageal cancers. It can be performed laparoscopically or by open method.
meta analysis	With other organs, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery.
meta analysis	However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic transhiatal oesophagectomy in terms of post-operative complications and oncological clearance compared with open transhiatal oesophagectomy.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of laparoscopic versus open oesophagectomy for people with oesophageal cancer undergoing transhiatal oesophagectomy.
meta analysis	Search methods: We electronically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until August 2015.
meta analysis	We also searched the references of included trials to identify further trials.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies comparing laparoscopic with open transhiatal oesophagectomy in patients with resectable oesophageal cancer, regardless of language, blinding, or publication status for the review.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently identified trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
meta analysis	We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using both fixed-effect and random-effects models, with RevMan 5, based on intention-to-treat analyses.
meta analysis	Main results: We found no randomised controlled trials on this topic.
meta analysis	We included six non-randomised studies (five retrospective) that compared laparoscopic versus open transhiatal oesophagectomy (334 patients: laparoscopic = 154 patients; open = 180 patients); five studies (326 patients: laparoscopic = 151 patients; open = 175 patients) provided information for one or more outcomes.
meta analysis	Most studies included a mixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and different stages of oesophageal cancer, without metastases.
meta analysis	All the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias; the overall quality of evidence was very low for all the outcomes.
meta analysis	The differences between laparoscopic and open transhiatal oesophagectomy were imprecise for short-term mortality (laparoscopic = 0/151 (adjusted proportion based on meta-analysis estimate: 0. 5%) versus open = 2/175 (1. 1%); RR 0. 44; 95% CI 0.
meta analysis	05 to 4. 09; participants = 326; studies = 5; I² = 0%); long-term mortality (HR 0. 97; 95% CI 0. 81 to 1. 16; participants = 193; studies = 2; I² = 0%); anastomotic stenosis (laparoscopic = 4/36 (11. 1%) versus open = 3/37 (8. 1%); RR 1. 37; 95% CI 0.
meta analysis	33 to 5. 70; participants = 73; studies = 1); short-term recurrence (laparoscopic = 1/16 (6. 3%) versus open = 0/4 (0%); RR 0. 88; 95% CI 0. 04 to 18. 47; participants = 20; studies = 1); long-term recurrence (HR 1. 00; 95% CI 0. 84 to 1.
meta analysis	18; participants = 173; studies = 2); proportion of people who required blood transfusion (laparoscopic = 0/36 (0%) versus open = 6/37 (16. 2%); RR 0. 08; 95% CI 0. 00 to 1.
meta analysis	35; participants = 73; studies = 1); proportion of people with positive resection margins (laparoscopic = 15/102 (15. 8%) versus open = 27/111 (24. 3%); RR 0. 65; 95% CI 0. 37 to 1.
meta analysis	12; participants = 213; studies = 3; I² = 0%); and the number of lymph nodes harvested during surgery (median difference between the groups varied from 12 less to 3 more lymph nodes in the laparoscopic compared to the open group; participants = 326; studies = 5).
meta analysis	The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was lower in the laparoscopic group (10/99, (10. 3%) compared to the open group = 24/114 (21. 1%); RR 0. 49; 95% CI 0. 24 to 0.
meta analysis	99; participants = 213; studies = 3; I² = 0%); as it was for adverse events in the laparoscopic group = 37/99 (39. 9%) versus the open group = 71/114 (62. 3%); RR 0. 64; 95% CI 0. 48 to 0.
meta analysis	86; participants = 213; studies = 3; I² = 0%); and the median lengths of hospital stay were significantly less in the laparoscopic group than the open group (three days less in all three studies that reported this outcome; number of participants = 266).
meta analysis	There was lack of clarity as to whether the median difference in the quantity of blood transfused was statistically significant favouring laparoscopic oesophagectomy in the only study that reported this information.
meta analysis	None of the studies reported post-operative dysphagia, health-related quality of life, time-to-return to normal activity (return to pre-operative mobility without caregiver support), or time-to-return to work.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: There are currently no randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic with open transhiatal oesophagectomy for patients with oesophageal cancers.
meta analysis	In observational studies, laparoscopic transhiatal oesophagectomy is associated with fewer overall complications and shorter hospital stays than open transhiatal oesophagectomy. However, this association is unlikely to be causal.
meta analysis	There is currently no information to determine a causal association in the differences between the two surgical approaches.
meta analysis	Randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic transhiatal oesophagectomy with other methods of oesophagectomy are required to determine the optimal method of oesophagectomy.
meta analysis	Laparoscopic versus open transhiatal oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: The prognostic role and definition of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement in operable oesophageal cancer remain controversial.
meta analysis	The College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) define CRM involvement as tumour found at the cut resection margin and within 1 mm of the cut margin respectively.
meta analysis	This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine the influence of CRM involvement on survival in operable oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (January 1990 to June 2012) were searched for studies correlating CRM involvement with 5-year mortality.
meta analysis	Statistical analysis of dichotomous variables was performed using the odds ratio (OR) as the summary statistic.
meta analysis	Results: Fourteen studies involving 2433 patients with oesophageal cancer who had undergone potentially curative oesophagectomy were analysed.
meta analysis	Rates of CRM involvement were 15·3 per cent (173 of 1133) and 36·5 per cent (889 of 2433) according to the CAP and RCP criteria respectively.
meta analysis	Overall 5-year mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with CRM involvement compared with CRM-negative patients according to both CAP (OR 4·02, 95 per cent confidence interval (c. i.
meta analysis	) 2·25 to 7·20; P < 0·001) and RCP (OR 2·52, 1·96 to 3·25; P < 0·001) criteria.
meta analysis	CRM involvement between 0·1 and 1 mm was associated with a significantly higher 5-year mortality rate than CRM-negative status (involvement more than 1 mm from CRM) (OR 2·05, 95 per cent c. i. 1·41 to 2·99; P < 0·001).
meta analysis	Conclusion: CRM involvement is an important predictor of poor prognosis. CAP criteria differentiate a higher-risk group than RCP criteria, but overlook a patient group with similar poor outcomes.

Case series	Background: The presence of lymph node (LN) metastases in esophageal cancer has important prognostic and treatment implications. However, the optimal number of LNs that should be examined for accurate staging is controversial.
Case series	In the current study, the association between survival and the number of LNs evaluated was examined in patients who underwent resection of lymph node-negative (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] TNM stage I-IIA) esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: All patients were identified who underwent surgery for lymph node-negative esophageal cancer between 1988 and 2003 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry.
Case series	Patients were classified into 3 groups by the number of negative LNs sampled during surgery (<or=10 LNs, 11-17 LNs, and>or=18 LNs). Esophageal cancer-specific survival was compared among these LN groups using Kaplan-Meier curves.
Case series	Stratified and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between survival and the number of negative LNs after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 972 patients were included in the study.
Case series	Disease-specific survival rates increased with a higher number of negative LNs.
Case series	The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 55% among patients with<or=10 negative LNs, compared with 66% and 75%, respectively, for those with 11 to 17 negative LNs and>or=18 negative LNs.
Case series	The number of negative LNs was found to be significantly associated with survival in analyses stratified by tumor status.
Case series	On multivariate regression controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex, histology, tumor status, and postoperative radiotherapy, a higher number of negative LNs was found to be independently associated with higher disease-specific survival.
Case series	Conclusions: The presence of LN metastases in patients with esophageal cancer appears to have important prognostic and treatment implications.
Case series	Data from the current study suggest that patients undergoing surgical resection for esophageal cancer should have at least 18 LNs removed.
Case series	Effect of the number of lymph nodes sampled on postoperative survival of lymph node-negative esophageal cancer
Case series	Esophageal cancer (EC) frequently presents with advanced stages and is associated with high recurrence rates after esophagectomy. The value of an extended lymph node dissection (ELND) remains unclear in this setting.
Case series	An EC data set was created from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results 1973-2003 database. Relationships between the number of lymph nodes (LNs) examined and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.
Case series	From a cohort of 40,129 EC patients, 5,620 individuals were selected. The median age was 65 (range: 11-102), and 75% were men. The median tumor size was 5. 0 cm (0. 1-30).
Case series	On multivariate analysis, total LN count (or negative LN count, respectively) was an independent prognostic variable, aside from age, race, resection status, radiation, T category, N category (all at p < 0. 0001), and M category (p = 0. 0003).
Case series	Higher total LN count (>30) and negative LN count (>15) categories were associated with best OS and lowest 90-day mortality (p < 0. 0001). The numeric LN effect on OS was independent from nodal status or histology.
Case series	Greater total and negative LN counts are associated with longer EC survival. Although the mechanism remains uncertain, it does not appear to be limited to stage migration.
Case series	ELND during potentially curative esophagectomy for EC can be supported by the data.
Case series	Clinical impact of lymphadenectomy extent in resectable esophageal cancer
Case series	Objective: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data indicate that number of lymph nodes removed impacts survival in gastric cancer. Our aim was to study this relationship in esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: The study population included 2303 esophageal cancer patients (1381 adenocarcinoma, 922 squamous) from 9 international centers that had R0 esophagectomy prior to 2002 and were followed at regular intervals for 5 years or until death.
Case series	Patients treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy were excluded. Results: Operations consisted of esophagectomy with (1700) and without (603) thoracotomy. Median number of nodes removed was 17 (IQR10-29).
Case series	There were 508 patients with stage I, 853 stage II, and 942 stage III. Five-year survival was 40%. Cox regression analysis showed that the number of lymph nodes removed was an independent predictor of survival (P < 0. 0001).
Case series	The optimal threshold predicted by Cox regression for this survival benefit was removal of a minimum of 23 nodes.
Case series	Other independent predictors of survival were the number of involved nodes, depth of invasion, presence of nodal metastasis, and cell type.
Case series	Conclusions: The number of lymph nodes removed is an independent predictor of survival after esophagectomy for cancer. To maximize this survival benefit a minimum of 23 regional lymph nodes must be removed.
Case series	The number of lymph nodes removed predicts survival in esophageal cancer: an international study on the impact of extent of surgical resection
Case series	Objective: Using Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration data, we sought to (1) characterize the relationship between survival and extent of lymphadenectomy, and (2) from this, define optimum lymphadenectomy.
Case series	Summary background data: What constitutes optimum lymphadenectomy to maximize survival is controversial because of variable goals, analytic methodology, and generalizability of the underpinning data.
Case series	Methods: A total of 4627 patients who had esophagectomy alone for esophageal cancer were identified from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration database. Patient-specific risk-adjusted survival was estimated using random survival forests.
Case series	Risk-adjusted 5-year survival was averaged for each number of lymph nodes resected and its relation to cancer characteristics explored.
Case series	Optimum number of nodes that should be resected to maximize 5-year survival was determined by random forest multivariable regression.
Case series	Results: For pN0M0 moderately and poorly differentiated cancers, and all node-positive (pN+) cancers, 5-year survival improved with increasing extent of lymphadenectomy.
Case series	In pN0M0 cancers, no optimum lymphadenectomy was defined for pTis; optimum lymphadenectomy was 10 to 12 nodes for pT1, 15 to 22 for pT2, and 31 to 42 for pT3/T4, depending on histopathologic cell type.
Case series	In pN+M0 cancers and 1 to 6 nodes positive, optimum lymphadenectomy was 10 for pT1, 15 for pT2, and 29 to 50 for pT3/T4.
Case series	Conclusions: Greater extent of lymphadenectomy was associated with increased survival for all patients with esophageal cancer except at the extremes (TisN0M0 and >or=7 regional lymph nodes positive for cancer) and well-differentiated pN0M0 cancer.
Case series	Maximum 5-year survival is modulated by T classification: resecting 10 nodes for pT1, 20 for pT2, and >or=30 for pT3/T4 is recommended.
Case series	Optimum lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To clarify whether systemic lymph node dissection (LND) influences the safety of surgery and the survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT).
randomized controlled trial	Summary background data: Prognostic impact of systemic lymphadenectomy during surgery after nCRT for ESCC is still uncertain and requires clarification.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This is a secondary analysis of NEOCRTEC5010 trial which compared nCRT followed by surgery versus surgery alone for locally advanced ESCC.
randomized controlled trial	Relationship between number of LND and perioperative, recurrence and survival outcomes were analyzed in the nCRT group. Results: Three-year overall survival was significantly better in the nCRT group than the S group (75. 2% vs 61. 5%; P=0. 011).
randomized controlled trial	In the nCRT group, greater number of LND was associated with significantly better overall survival (HR, 0. 358; P < 0. 001) and disease-free survival (HR, 0. 415; P=0. 001), but without any negative impact on postoperative complications.
randomized controlled trial	Less LND (< 20 vs ≥ 20) was significantly associated with increased local recurrence (18. 8% vs 5. 2%, P=0. 004) and total recurrence rates (41. 2% vs 25. 8%, P=0. 027).
randomized controlled trial	Compared to patients with persistent nodal disease, significantly better survival was seen in patients with complete response and with LND ≥ 20, but not in those with LND < 20.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Systemic lymph node dissection does not increase surgical risks after nCRT in ESCC patients. And it is associated with better survival and local disease control.
randomized controlled trial	Therefore, systemic lymphadenectomy should still be considered as an integrated part of surgery after nCRT for ESCC.
randomized controlled trial	Impact of Lymph Node Dissection on Survival after Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: From the Results of NEOCRTEC5010, a Randomized Multicenter Study
Case series	Objectives: Lymph node metastasis is among the most important prognostic factors for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after curative esophagectomy; however, the extent of lymphadenectomy is still controversial.
Case series	The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of lymphatic metastases and to study the pattern of lymph node metastasis in a large study population.
Case series	Methods: The data from 1361 patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent curative R0 esophagectomy were retrospectively examined.
Case series	Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with lymph node metastasis. Results: Of the 1361 patients, 714 (52. 5%) were found to have lymph node metastasis.
Case series	The frequency of lymph node metastasis increased as the tumor invasion increased. Paratracheal nodes were the most frequent metastasis nodes (15. 9%). The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 9. 8% in the neck, 18. 0% in the upper mediastinum, 18.
Case series	9% in the middle mediastinum, 11. 8% in the lower mediastinum, and 28. 4% in the abdomen. Of these 714 patients, 424 (31. 2%) presented with 1 field involvement, 255 (18. 7%) with 2 fields, and 35 (2. 6%) with 3 fields involvement.
Case series	Logistic regression analysis revealed tumor length (P <. 001), tumor invasion (P <. 001), tumor differentiation (P =. 003), and lymphovascular invasion (P <. 001) were risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Tumor location (P <.
Case series	001), tumor invasion (P =. 003), lymphovascular invasion (P =. 004), and paratracheal lymph node involvement (P =. 002) were identified as risk factors for cervical lymph node metastasis.
Case series	Conclusions: Metastases were more frequent in the abdomen than in the neck. Total mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenectomy should be carefully conducted.
Case series	Certain factors, such as tumor location, depth of tumor invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and paratracheal lymph node involvement, might be helpful in determining the need to perform cervical lymphadenectomy in individual patients.
Case series	Pattern of lymphatic spread in thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A single-institution experience
Case series	Objective: To determine the prevalence of occult cervical nodal metastases in patients with squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, and to determine the impact of esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection on survival and recurrence rates.
Case series	Summary background data: Although esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection is commonly practiced in Japan, its role in the surgical management of esophageal cancer in the United States, especially in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, is essentially unknown.
Case series	Methods: This is a prospective observational study of esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy. Eighty patients underwent resection between August 1994 and April 2001.
Case series	Clinicopathological information and follow-up data were collected on all patients until death or June 2001. Results: Hospital mortality and morbidity rates were 5% and 46%, respectively.
Case series	Metastases to the recurrent laryngeal and/or deep cervical nodes occurred in 36% of patients irrespective of cell type (adenocarcinoma 37%, squamous 34%) or location within the esophagus (lower third 32%, middle third 60%).
Case series	Overall 5-year and disease-free survival rates were 51% and 46%, respectively. Sixty-nine percent presented with nodal metastases. The 5-year survival rate for node-negative patients was 88%; that for those with nodal metastases was 33%.
Case series	The 5-year survival rate in patients with positive cervical nodes was 25% (squamous 40%, adenocarcinoma 15%). Conclusions: Esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection can be performed with a low mortality and reasonable morbidity.
Case series	Unsuspected metastases to the recurrent laryngeal and/or cervical nodes are present in 36% of patients regardless of cell type or location within the esophagus. Thirty percent of patients were upstaged, mainly from stage III to stage IV.
Case series	An overall 5-year survival rate of 51% suggests a true survival benefit beyond that achieved solely on the basis of stage migration.
Case series	Three-field lymph node dissection for squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	Background: The extent of lymph node dissection can affect tumour node metastasis staging. The resulting 'stage migration' might hamper stage-by-stage comparison between different forms of oesophageal resection.
Case series	The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic impact of extended en bloc lymphadenectomy in staging (adeno)carcinoma of the mid/distal oesophagus or gastric cardia.
Case series	Methods: This was a prospective study of 74 patients (67 men and seven women; median age 63 (range 40-78) years) who underwent extended oesophagectomy between 1994 and 2000.
Case series	Results: A median of 31 (range 15-78) lymph nodes was resected (and identified), with a median of 5 (range 0-31) positive nodes.
Case series	Twenty-seven patients (36 per cent) had tumour-positive nodes in extended fields: 15 patients (20 per cent) in the abdomen and 15 patients (20 per cent) in the mediastinum. Subcarinal nodes were most affected (19 per cent).
Case series	Extended resection led to tumour upstaging in 17 patients (23 per cent); two patients had isolated positive subcarinal nodes and 15 other tumours became M1a owing to positive nodes near the coeliac axis, hepatic artery or splenic artery.
Case series	Tumour positivity in paratracheal or aortopulmonary nodes occurred in 8 per cent of patients, without influencing staging.
Case series	Conclusion: Extended en bloc lymphadenectomy altered staging in 17 of 74 patients (23 per cent) with adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or cardia, mainly into M1a owing to positive coeliac nodes (20 per cent).
Case series	Prospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of extended en bloc resection for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or gastric cardia
Case series	Background: Despite increasingly radical surgery for oesophageal cancer, many patients continue to develop recurrent disease.
Case series	The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of failure following attempted curative oesophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the middle and lower third of the oesophagus.
Case series	Methods: A total of 176 consecutive patients discharged from hospital following R0 resection between 1 April 1990 and 31 December 1999 were followed for evidence of recurrence over a mean interval of 26 months.
Case series	Results: Adenocarcinoma was the predominant histological subtype (n = 113) compared with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 63). Sex and age distribution were similar for both histological subtypes (M:F ratio 2. 5:1, median age 64 (range 40-77) years).
Case series	Overall 2- and 5-year survival rates were 54 and 31 per cent respectively. Some 85 patients (48 per cent) developed proven recurrence, of whom five are alive and 80 dead. The median time to recurrence was 11. 7 (range 1.
Case series	5-67) months, with a median survival thereafter of only 2. 7 (0-25. 9) months.
Case series	The pattern of recurrence was locoregional in 27 per cent (mediastinal 21 per cent and cervical 6 per cent) and distant in 18 per cent (liver 6 per cent, bone 6 per cent, cerebral 2 per cent, peritoneal 2 per cent, lung 1 per cent, skin 1 per cent).
Case series	There was no difference in the overall pattern of dissemination or timing of recurrence for either histological subtype.
Case series	Over 50 per cent of all recurrences occurred within 12 months of surgery, with local, regional and distant recurrence occurring at a median of 11. 9 (range 1. 8-52), 11. 0 (range 5-67) and 11. 0 (1. 5-58) months respectively.
Case series	Conclusion: The low incidence of cervical recurrence suggests that a more extensive 'three-field' lymphadenectomy is unlikely to improve survival rates.
Case series	Better staging modalities are needed to identify patients who will have recurrence within 12 months of operation, so that they may be either entered into trials of multimodality treatment or offered non-surgical palliation.

Case series	Pattern of recurrence following radical oesophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy
Cohort study	Controversy continues over the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy (regional versus three-field) for a potentially resectable squamous cell carcinoma in the thoracic esophagus.
Cohort study	In the Consensus Conference of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus (ISDE), held in Munich in 1994, the types of lymphadenectomy were classified as standard, extended, total, or three-field lymphadenectomy.
Cohort study	The objective of the present study was to determine the optimal procedure among these four types of lymphadenectomy.
Cohort study	The mortality and morbidity rates, postoperative course, and survival rates were compared among 302 patients who underwent curative (R0) transthoracic esophagectomy with one of these four types of lymphadenectomy at Kurume University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan, from 1986 to 1998.
Cohort study	Three-field lymphadenectomy resulted in better survival than any other type of lymphadenectomy for patients with positive lymph node metastasis from a cancer in the upper or middle thoracic esophagus.
Cohort study	A postoperative complication, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, anastomotic leakage, and tracheal ischemic lesion, was significantly more common after three-field lymphadenectomy.
Cohort study	However, the mortality rate was the same among the four procedures.
Cohort study	Three-field lymphadenectomy was optimal for an upper or middle thoracic esophageal cancer with metastasis in the lymph node(s) based on improved long-term survival, whereas there was not a large difference in short-term and long-term outcomes after the four types of lymphadenectomy for a lower thoracic esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Optimal lymphadenectomy for squamous cell carcinoma in the thoracic esophagus: comparing the short- and long-term outcome among the four types of lymphadenectomy
randomized controlled trial	Background: Recurrence of thoracic esophageal carcinoma in the cervical and superior mediastinal lymph nodes occurs frequently and contributes to a poor prognosis. Extensive lymphadenectomy has been advocated.
randomized controlled trial	Findings in support of this to date, however, have been based on a comparison with historical controls. We herein report a prospective randomized trial of extended and conventional lymphadenectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Cases of thoracic esophageal carcinoma meeting criteria predictive of complete resection were randomized into conventional and extended cervical and superior mediastinal lymphadenectomy groups.
randomized controlled trial	Results: In the extended and conventional lymphadenectomy groups, respectively, mean operative time was 487 +/- 47 and 396 +/- 43 minutes, blood loss was 850 +/- 429 and 576 +/- 261 mL, node count was 82 +/- 22 and 43 +/- 15, hospital deaths occurred in 3% and 7%, 2-year survival was 83.
randomized controlled trial	3% and 64. 8%, 5-year survival was 66. 2% and 48. 0%, and recurrence rate was 19. 9% and 24. 1%. Conclusion: Extended lymphadenectomy may prevent recurrence and prolong survival after resection of thoracic esophageal carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	A prospective randomized trial of extended cervical and superior mediastinal lymphadenectomy for carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Background: Leak from cervical esophagogastric anastomosis (CEGA) following esophagectomy is associated with morbidity and poor functional outcome.
randomized controlled trial	To address this issue, we conducted a randomized trial comparing "hand-sewn" with "stapled side-to-side" CEGA.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Of 174 patients who underwent esophageal resection and CEGA between 2004 and 2010, 87 each were randomized to "hand-sewn" and "stapled side-to-side" CEGA [ www. Clinical Trials. gov: NCT00497549].
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome measure was anastomotic leak rate. The secondary outcome measures included CEGA construction time and occurrence of anastomotic stricture during follow up. Results: The overall anastomotic leak rate was 17. 2% (major leaks: 8 %).
randomized controlled trial	The leak rate was similar among the two groups (hand-sewn: 14/87, stapled: 16/87; p=0. 33). The stapled anastomotic technique was faster (25 ±. 5 min vs. 27 ± 5. 5 min; p=0. 02). The overall operative mortality and morbidity rates were 6. 3 % and 40.
randomized controlled trial	8 %, respectively. At a median follow up of 12 (6-42) months, anastomotic stricture occurred in 24 (14. 7 %) patients and was significantly more common in the "hand-sewn" group (17/82 vs. 7/81; p=0. 045).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: There were no differences in the leak rates and postoperative outcome between the two CEGA techniques. At follow up, anastomotic strictures occurred less frequently following stapled CEGA. The ideal CEGA technique remains elusive.

review	Anastomotic complications are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality following esophagectomy for cancer. Conflicting reports exist regarding the superiority of hand-sewn versus stapled techniques.
review	This systematic review identified eight randomized clinical trials examining this issue. None of the studies reported significant differences in leak rate or early mortality.
review	One study demonstrated a difference in stricture rates, with fewer for hand-sewn anastomoses. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one anastomotic technique over the other.
review	Methods of esophagogastric anastomoses following esophagectomy for cancer: A systematic review
meta analysis	Background: Cervical anastomosis and thoracic anastomosis are used for gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer.
meta analysis	This systematic review was conducted in order to identify randomized trials that compare cervical with thoracic anastomosis.
meta analysis	Methods: A literature search for randomized trials was performed in the following databases: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Results: A total of 4 trials were included. All studies had a small sample size and were of moderate quality.
meta analysis	One trial was excluded from the meta-analysis. The following outcomes were significantly associated with a cervical anastomosis: recurrent laryngeal nerve trauma (OR: 7. 14; 95% CI: 1. 75-29. 14; p = 0. 006) and anastomotic leakage (OR: 3.
meta analysis	43; 95% CI: 1. 09-10. 78; p = 0. 03). None of the following outcomes were associated with the location of the anastomosis: pulmonary complications (OR: 0. 86; 95% CI: 0. 13-5. 59; p = 0. 87), perioperative mortality (OR: 1. 24; 95% CI: 0. 35-4.
meta analysis	41; p = 0. 74), benign stricture formation (OR: 0. 79; 95% CI: 0. 17-3. 87; p = 0. 79) or tumor recurrence (OR: 2. 01; 95% CI: 0. 68-5. 91; p = 0. 21).
meta analysis	Conclusion: Cervical anastomosis could be associated with a higher leak rate and recurrent nerve trauma. However, the currently available randomized evidence is limited.
meta analysis	Further randomized trials are needed to provide sufficient evidence for the preferred location of the anastomosis after esophagectomy.
meta analysis	Cervical or thoracic anastomosis after esophagectomy for cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
randomized controlled trial	Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the hand-sewn and stapled methods in esophagogastric anastomosis.
randomized controlled trial	Summary background data: After esophageal resection for cancer, the relative merits of the hand-sewn and the stapled methods of esophagogastric anastomosis, especially regarding leakage and stricture rates, have not adequately been studied.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 122 patients with squamous cell cancer of the thoracic esophagus who underwent a Lewis-Tanner esophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were stratified according to esophageal size, based on the diameter of the divided esophagus (< or > or = 30 mm) and then were randomized to have either a hand-sewn or a stapled anastomosis.
randomized controlled trial	Results: The mean total operating times (standard error of the mean) when the hand-sewn and the stapled methods were used were 214 (4) minutes and 217 (3. 4) minutes, respectively (p = not significant [NS]).
randomized controlled trial	The respective in vivo proximal resection margins (standard error of the mean) were 8 (0. 4) cm and 7. 6 (0. 4) cm (p = NS). Leakage rates were 1. 6% and 4. 9% (p = NS).
randomized controlled trial	Excluding hospital deaths, patients with leakage or anastomotic recurrence, and those who received radiation therapy to histologically infiltrated resection margin, anastomotic stricture was found in 5 (9.
randomized controlled trial	1%) of 55 patients in the hand-sewn group and 20 (40%) of 50 in the stapler group (p = 0. 0003). The difference in stricture rates was significant in small as well as large esophagi. Anastomotic recurrence developed in only one patient in each group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The authors conclude that both methods were safe, but the stapled technique resulted in more stricture formation.

randomized controlled trial	Objective: The use of a circular stapler in cervical esophagogastric anastomosis remains controversial.
randomized controlled trial	This study was to compare the postoperative and long-term results of manual and mechanical techniques for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis after resection for squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 63 patients with curatively resectable squamous cell cancer of the thoracic esophagus between 1996 and 1999.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomized to receive either a hand-sewn (32 patients) or circular stapled (31 patients) cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. Results: The mean operating time was longer when the hand-sewn method was used (524 vs. 447 min, P < 0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Anastomotic leakage was noted in seven patients (22%) in the hand-sewn group and eight patients (26%) in the stapler group (P = NS).
randomized controlled trial	Hospital mortality occurred in four patients (13%) of the hand-sewn group and in three patients (10%) of the stapler group (P = NS).
randomized controlled trial	After the operation, four patients (14%) in the hand-sewn group and five patients (18%) in the stapler group developed a benign esophageal stricture (P = NS).
randomized controlled trial	The mean follow-up time was 24 months, and the rates of freedom from benign stricture and survival were comparable in each group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Performing cervical esophagogastric anastomoses using a circular mechanical stapler had a shorter operating time and a comparable outcome to the hand-sewn method.
randomized controlled trial	The circular mechanical stapler could be used as an alternative for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis after resection for esophageal squamous cell cancer.

meta analysis	Background: Esophagogastric anastomotic leaks continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy. Leaks usually result from technical errors or occult ischemia of the mobilized gastric fundus.
meta analysis	The introduction of stapled esophagogastric anastomoses was initially very promising; leak rates appeared to be reduced.
meta analysis	Data sources: The English language medical literature was searched for publications comparing stapled and hand-sewn esophagogastric anastomoses.
meta analysis	We reviewed data from four randomized trials and seven nonrandomized comparative studies to determine if stapling was superior to hand suturing for esophagogastric anastomoses.
meta analysis	Results: Pooled data from randomized trials comparing stapled with hand-sewn esophagogastric anastomoses showed no significant difference for leaks (stapled 9%, hand-sewn 8%, P <0.
meta analysis	67), but a higher incidence of strictures in stapled anastomoses (stapled 27%, hand-sewn 16%, P < 0. 02). In nonrandomized studies, stapled anastomoses had a lower leak rate (stapled 6%, hand-sewn 11%, P < 0.
meta analysis	0001), but strictures were more frequent (stapled 31%, hand-sewn 16%, P < 0. 0001). A major source of bias in the nonrandomized studies was the comparison of contemporary stapled experience and earlier hand-sewn experience.
meta analysis	This bias was not present in three of seven nonrandomized studies that featured prospective data collection. Pooled data from these three studies showed no difference in anastomotic leak rate (stapled 4%, hand-sewn 6%, P < 0. 28).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Stapled and hand-sewn esophagogastric anastomotic techniques have equivalent anastomotic leak rates, but strictures are more common in stapled anastomoses.
meta analysis	Irrespective of which technique is used, surgical experience and meticulous attention to detail are required to prevent anastomotic complications.
meta analysis	Anastomotic technical modifications alone are unlikely to eliminate the problem of leaks, since they do not address the problem of gastric fundal ischemia.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: The classic manual end-to-side technique of esophagogastrostomy after gastric pull-up to the neck carries a rather high risk of fistula and stricture.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: A terminalized semimechanical side-to-side technique of cervical esophagogastrostomy was performed in 16 patients by the application of an Endo-GIA stapler across the gastric and esophageal walls placed side by side, so as to create a V-shaped posterior opening between the two lumina.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The anterior aspect of the anastomosis was hand-sewn using a classic running suture.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The cross-sectional area of the semimechanical anastomoses was estimated by barium swallow study 2 months after operation and compared with that of 24 manual end-to-side esophagogastrostomies. Results: The cross-sectional area was 225 +/- 15.
Non-randomized controlled trial	7 mm2 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) for the 16 semimechanical anastomoses versus 136 +/- 15 mm2 for the 24 manual anastomoses (p = 0. 0001). The anastomotic area decreased from 206. 6 +/- 13. 5 mm2 in 29 patients without dysphagia to 107.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5 +/- 4. 7 mm2 in 7 patients with moderate dysphagia for solids that did not require endoscopic dilation and to 55. 7 +/- 16 mm2 in 4 patients with severe dysphagia that required dilation (p = 0).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The anastomotic area in 6 of the 7 patients with initial moderate dysphagia for solids increased spontaneously with time from 107. 3 +/- 5. 5 mm2 to 174. 6 +/- 8. 1 mm2, with concomitant symptomatic relief (p = 0. 0277).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The terminalized semimechanical side-to-side suture technique produces a larger anastomosis than the classic end-to-side esophagogastrostomy technique.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Inflammatory changes related to the operation may cause transient narrowing of a cervical esophagogastrostomy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Terminalized semimechanical side-to-side suture technique for cervical esophagogastrostomy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Although the acute postoperative complications of a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis are less than those with an intrathoracic esophageal anastomosis, the long-term sequelae of a cervical anastomotic leak are not as minor as initially reported.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Nearly 50% of cervical anastomotic leaks result in an anastomotic stricture, and the subsequent need for chronic dilatations negates the merits of an operation intended to restore comfortable swallowing.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether construction of a side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis after transhiatal esophagectomy could reliably eliminate the majority of anastomotic leaks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: In 114 consecutive patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy, a functional side-to-side cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was constructed with the Auto Suture Endo-GIA II stapler (United States Surgical Corporation, Auto Suture Company Division, Norwalk, Conn) applied directly through the cervical wound.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This side-to-side stapled anastomosis has 3 rows of staples. Early postoperative anastomotic morbidity, subsequent need for anastomotic dilatations, and patient satisfaction with swallowing were evaluated.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Before the side-to-side stapled anastomosis, the incidence of cervical esophagogastric anastomosis leak in over 1000 patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy having a manually sewn anastomosis varied from 10% to 15%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Among the 111 survivors of transhiatal esophagectomy and a side-to-side stapled anastomosis, there were 3 (2. 7%) clinically significant anastomotic leaks.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This lowered incidence of leaks has contributed to reduction in the average length of stay after an uncomplicated transhiatal esophagectomy to 7 days and has provided more comfortable swallowing, ease of subsequent esophageal dilatations, and greater patient satisfaction.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Construction of the cervical esophagogastric anastomosis with a side-to-side stapled anastomosis greatly reduces the frequency of anastomotic leaks and later strictures.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The side-to-side stapled anastomosis is a major technical advance in the progression of refinements of transhiatal esophagectomy and a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis.

Cohort study	Objective: We sought to compare the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer who had either modified Collard or standard hand-sewn cervical esophagogastric anastomoses in reconstruction during esophagectomy.
Cohort study	Methods: From March of 1996 to October of 2002, 274 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with gastric replacement and cervical esophagogastric anastomosis.
Cohort study	Beginning in March of 2001, a modified Collard technique (stapled) was used in most patients (n = 86) for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis; a standard hand-sewn technique (sewn) was used in all others (n = 188).
Cohort study	Using a propensity score based on 8 variables (age, gender, race, surgeon, surgical approach, pathologic stage, histologic cell type, and induction chemoradiotherapy), 85 patient pairs were matched and followed for time-related events.
Cohort study	Outcome comparisons included cervical wound infection, cervical anastomotic leak, other hospital complications, length of stay, anastomotic dilatation, reflux symptoms, and survival.
Cohort study	Results: At 30 days, freedom from cervical wound infection was 92% for stapled versus 71% for sewn anastomoses ( P =. 001), and freedom from cervical anastomotic leak was 96% versus 89% ( P =. 09), respectively.
Cohort study	Other hospital complications occurred in 58% and 49%, respectively ( P =. 17). Median length of stay was 10 days for both ( P =. 3). At 2 years, freedom from anastomotic dilatation was 34% for stapled versus 10% for sewn anastomoses ( P <.
Cohort study	0001), and the mean number of dilatations per patient was 2. 4 versus 4. 1 ( P =. 0001), respectively. Reflux was rare for both.
Cohort study	Thirty-day, 6-month, and 24-month survivals were 98%, 91%, and 77% for stapled anastomoses and 98%, 88%, and 69% for sewn anastomoses ( P =. 3).
Cohort study	Conclusions: The modified Collard anastomotic technique dramatically reduces morbidity after esophagectomy. It should replace hand-sewn esophagogastric anastomoses.
Cohort study	Does esophagogastric anastomotic technique influence the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer?
meta analysis	Objective: To evaluate the risks and benefits of using a circular stapler (CS) compared with the hand-sewn (HS) method for the esophagogastric anastomosis after esophageal resection.
meta analysis	Background data: Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated that the use of a CS might prevent anastomotic leakage, whereas it was more likely to lead to anastomotic strictures.
meta analysis	The relative efficacy of this intervention in comparison with the HS method has not been conclusively determined.
meta analysis	Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of all RCTs that compared HS versus mechanical anastomosis using a CS was conducted regarding the leakage, strictures, operative time, and mortality.
meta analysis	The study protocol was established a priori according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Twelve RCTs were included with a total of 1407 patients.
meta analysis	The use of a CS, compared with the HS method, (1) led to no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic leakage [risk ratio (RR): 1. 02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0. 66-1. 59] or postoperative mortality (RR: 1. 64, 95% CI: 0. 95-2.
meta analysis	83), (2) increased the incidence of anastomotic strictures (RR: 1. 67, 95% CI: 1. 16-2. 42), and (3) reduced the length of the operation time (mean: -15. 3 minutes, range: -28. 1 to -2. 39).
meta analysis	For these results, a subgroup analysis and a meta-regression analysis yielded no significant differences for the anastomotic site, diameter of the CS, layer, or configuration.
meta analysis	Conclusion: The use of a CS contributed to reducing the length of the operation, but was associated with an increased risk of anastomotic strictures. Both the CS and the HS method are viable alternatives in the reconstruction after esophagectomy.

randomized controlled trial	Objective: The purpose of the study was to compare in prospective randomized fashion a manually sutured esophagogastric anastomosis in the neck and a stapled in the chest after esophageal resection and gastric tube reconstruction.
randomized controlled trial	Summary background data: Despite the fact that all reconstructions after esophagectomy will result in a cervical or a thoracic anastomosis, controversy still exists as to the optimal site for the anastomosis.
randomized controlled trial	In uncontrolled studies, both neck and chest anastomoses have been advocated. The only reported randomized study is difficult to evaluate because of varying routes of the substitute and different anastomotic techniques within the groups.
randomized controlled trial	The reported high failure rate of stapled anastomoses in the neck and the fact that most surgeons prefer to suture cervical anastomoses made us choose this technique for anastomosis in the neck.
randomized controlled trial	Our routine and the preference of most surgeons to staple high thoracic anastomoses became decisive for type of thoracic anastomoses.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Between May 9, 1990 and February 5, 1996, 83 patients undergoing esophageal resection were prospectively randomized to receive an esophagogastric anastomosis in the neck (41 patients) or an esophagogastric anastomosis in the chest (42 patients).
randomized controlled trial	To evaluate selection bias, patients undergoing esophageal resection during the same period but not randomized (n = 29) were also followed and compared with those in the study (n = 83).
randomized controlled trial	Objective measurements of anastomotic level and diameter were assessed with an endoscope and balloon catheter 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The long-term survival rates were compared with the log-rank test. Results: Two patients (1.
randomized controlled trial	8%) died in hospital, and the remaining 110 patients were followed until death or for a minimum of 60 months. The genuine 5-year survival rate was 29% for chest anastomoses and 30% for neck anastomoses. The overall leakage rate was 1.
randomized controlled trial	8% (2 cases of 112) with no relation to mortality or anastomotic method.
randomized controlled trial	All patients in the randomized group had tumor-free proximal and distal resection lines, but 1 patient in the nonrandomized group had tumor infiltrates in the proximal resection margin.
randomized controlled trial	At 3, 6, and 12 months after operation, there was no difference in anastomotic diameter between the esophagogastric anastomosis in the neck and in the thorax (P = 0. 771), and both increased with time (P = 0. 004, ANOVA repeated measures).
randomized controlled trial	Body weight development was the same in the two groups. With similar results in randomized and nonrandomized patients, study bias was eliminated.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: When performed in a standardized way, neck and chest anastomoses after esophageal resection are equally safe.
randomized controlled trial	The additional esophageal resection of 5 cm in the neck group did not increase tumor removal and survival; on the other hand, it did not adversely influence morbidity, anastomotic diameter, or eating as reflected by body weight development.
randomized controlled trial	Cervical or thoracic anastomosis after esophageal resection and gastric tube reconstruction: a prospective randomized trial comparing sutured neck anastomosis with stapled intrathoracic anastomosis
Cohort study	Background: Studies comparing the anastomotic leak rate in patients with an intrathoracic versus a cervical anastomosis after oesophagectomy are equivocal.
Cohort study	The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome after oesophagectomy in patients with an intrathoracic or cervical anastomosis, and to identify predictors of anastomotic leakage in a nationwide audit.
Cohort study	Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2015, all consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy for cancer were identified from the Dutch Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Audit.
Cohort study	For the comparison between an intrathoracic and cervical anastomosis, propensity score matching was used to adjust for potential confounders.
Cohort study	Multivariable logistic regression modelling with backward stepwise selection was used to determine independent predictors of anastomotic leakage. Results: Some 3348 patients were included.
Cohort study	After propensity score matching, 654 patients were included in both the cervical and intrathoracic anastomosis groups.
Cohort study	An intrathoracic anastomosis was associated with a lower leak rate than a cervical anastomosis (17·0 versus 21·9 per cent; P = 0·025).
Cohort study	The percentage of patients with recurrent nerve paresis was also lower (0·6 versus 7·0 per cent; P < 0·001) and an intrathoracic anastomosis was associated with a shorter median hospital stay (12 versus 14 days; P = 0·001).
Cohort study	Multivariable analysis revealed that ASA fitness grade III or higher, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus and proximal oesophageal tumours were independent predictors of anastomotic leakage.
Cohort study	Conclusion: An intrathoracic oesophagogastric anastomosis was associated with a lower anastomotic leak rate, lower rate of recurrent nerve paresis and a shorter hospital stay. Risk factors for anastomotic leak were co-morbidities and proximal tumours.

meta analysis	Background: A gastric conduit is usually used to reconstruct the foregut after esophagectomy for cancer. It can be transposed through a posterior or anterior mediastinal route.
meta analysis	The choice of route is often debated but there is little evidence to support the use of one route over the other.
meta analysis	We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effect of route of reconstruction on patient outcomes.
meta analysis	Methods: Medline and manual searches were done (completed independently and in duplicate) to identify all published RCTs that addressed the issue of route of gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer.
meta analysis	The selection process was inclusive; no trials were excluded. Trial validity assessment was done and a trial quality score was assigned.
meta analysis	Major outcomes for quantitative data synthesis included operative mortality, anastomotic leaks, cardiac morbidity, and pulmonary morbidity. A random-effects model was used and relative risk was the principal measure of effect.
meta analysis	Systematic qualitative review was used for other outcomes such as duration of ventilation, length of hospital stay, operative blood loss, duration of surgery, anastomotic strictures, dysphagia, gastric emptying, and quality of life.
meta analysis	Data on cancer survival were not available in the RCTs. Results: Six RCTs were selected with quality scores ranging from 1 to 4 (5-point Jadad scale). Selection and validity agreement was strong.
meta analysis	Relative risk (95% confidence interval; P value), expressed as posterior versus anterior mediastinal route (treatment versus control), was 0. 56 (0. 17, 1. 82; P = 0. 34) for mortality, 1. 01 (0. 35, 2. 94; P = 0. 98) for leaks, 0. 43 (0. 17, 1.
meta analysis	12; P = 0. 08) for cardiac complications, and 0. 67 (0. 34, 1. 33; P = 0. 26) for pulmonary complications.
meta analysis	Systematic qualitative review did not suggest any difference in other perioperative outcomes or conduit function for the two routes of reconstruction.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Data synthesized from existing RCTs show that posterior and anterior mediastinal routes of reconstruction are associated with similar outcomes after esophagectomy for cancer.
meta analysis	However, a difference in outcomes for the two reconstructive routes remains possible. Further trials with larger numbers of patients are needed.

Cohort study	Background: The stomach can be used either in its entirely or as a greater curvature tube for esophageal replacement.
Cohort study	Methods: The study compares the gastric tube (group A; n = 112) to the whole stomach whose lesser curvature is denuded (group B; n = 100) in terms of technical complication and alimentary comfort.
Cohort study	The clinical results are substantiated by assessment of the eating performance of patients and control subjects at a test meal, measurement of the gastric dimensions before and after both tailoring procedures, and intraarterial staining of the gastric wall.
Cohort study	Results: Major differences between the two groups are cervical anastomosis stenoses (22. 3% versus 6% [A versus B]; p = 0. 008), fistulas (7. 9% versus 1%; p = 0. 0209), number of meals and snacks per day (4. 6 versus 4; p = 0.
Cohort study	0275), sensation of early fullness at meals (52. 4% versus 17. 8%; p < 0. 0001), ratings given to the long-term alimentary comfort (presymptomatic condition = 10 points) (7. 6 versus 8. 8 out of 10 on average; p < 0.
Cohort study	0001), and calories consumed in 1 minute at a test meal (59% [p < 0. 05] versus 77% of those consumed by control subjects). The volume of the stomach is reduced by a range of 21. 4% to 47.
Cohort study	2% after tubulization (group A) whereas it increases by a range of 4. 9% to 17. 4% after denudation of the lesser curve (group B). Intraarterial staining of the gastric wall reveals the poor vascularity of the upper-most segment of the greater curve.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Slight increase of the gastric capacity and maintenance of the submucosal vascular network account for the better results achieved with the whole stomach.

Cohort study	Objective: Gastric outlet obstruction is common after esophagectomy. Our goal was to determine the incidence of gastric outlet obstruction after esophagectomy with or without pyloromyotomy and analyze its management by endoscopic pyloric dilatation.
Cohort study	Methods: Two hundred forty-two patients underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit from January 2002 to June 2006. Subjects were divided into two groups: Group A had no pyloromyotomy (n=83) and Group B had a pyloromyotomy (n=159).
Cohort study	Gastric outlet obstruction was strictly defined to include patients with clinical delayed gastric emptying supported by symptoms, barium swallow studies, persistent air-fluid level and dilated conduit on radiography, or endoscopic or surgical intervention to improve gastric drainage.
Cohort study	Results: The groups were similar except for a higher percentage of cervical anastomosis and older age (64- vs 61-year-old) in Group A. The overall incidence of gastric outlet obstruction was 15. 3% (37/242).
Cohort study	Pyloromyotomy did not reduce the incidence of gastric outlet obstruction (Group A 9. 6% vs Group B 18. 2%, p=0. 078). One patient required a late pyloroplasty. Successful management of gastric outlet obstruction with pyloric dilatation (96.
Cohort study	7%, 28/29) was unaffected by pyloromyotomy. There was no difference in length of stay, pneumonia (Group A 27. 7% vs Group B 19. 5%, p=0. 15), respiratory failure or anastomotic stricture.
Cohort study	There was no difference in anastomotic leaks when controlling for the anatomic location of the anastomosis (p=0. 36). Mortality was equivalent between groups (2. 4 vs 2. 5%, p=0. 96).
Cohort study	Conclusion: Pyloromyotomy does not reduce the incidence of symptomatic delayed gastric emptying after esophagectomy. Post-operative gastric outlet obstruction can be effectively managed with endoscopic pyloric dilatation.
Cohort study	Routine pyloromyotomy for the prevention of post-esophagectomy gastric outlet obstruction may be unwarranted.

meta analysis	Background/aim: A gastric conduit is usually used to reconstruct the foregut after esophagectomy for cancer.
meta analysis	The gastric emptying may be impaired after this operation, so some esophageal surgeons routinely add a pyloric drainage procedure (pyloroplasty or pyloromyotomy).
meta analysis	We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effect of pyloric drainage on patient outcomes.
meta analysis	Methods: Medline and manual searches were done (completed independently and in duplicate) to identify all published RCTs that addressed the issue of pyloric drainage procedures during gastric conduit reconstruction of the esophagus.
meta analysis	The selection process was inclusive; no trials were excluded. Trial validity assessment was done, and a trial quality score was assigned.
meta analysis	Early outcomes assessed by meta-analysis included operative mortality, esophagogastric anastomotic leaks, pulmonary morbidity, pyloric drainage complications, fatal pulmonary aspiration, and gastric outlet obstruction.
meta analysis	A random-effects model was used, and the relative risk was the principal measure of effect. Systematic semiquantitative review was used for late outcomes such as gastric emptying, bile reflux, nutritional status, and obstructive foregut symptoms.
meta analysis	Results: Nine RCTs, that included a total of 553 patients, were selected, with quality scores ranging from 1 to 4 (5-point Jadad scale). Selection and validity agreement was strong.
meta analysis	The relative risk (95% CI; p value), expressed as pyloric drainage versus no drainage (treatment vs. control), was 0. 92 (0. 34, 2. 44; p = 0. 86) for operative mortality, 0. 90 (0. 47, 1. 76; p = 0. 77) for esophagogastric anastomotic leaks, 0.
meta analysis	69 (0. 42, 1. 14; p = 0. 15) for pulmonary morbidity, 2. 55 (0. 34, 18. 98; p = 0. 36) for pyloric drainage complications, 0. 25 (0. 04, 1. 60; p = 0. 14) for fatal pulmonary aspiration, and 0. 18 (0. 03, 0. 97; p = 0.
meta analysis	046) for gastric outlet obstruction. Systematic semiquantitative review showed a nonsignificant trend favoring pyloric drainage for the late outcomes of gastric emptying, nutritional status, and obstructive foregut symptoms.
meta analysis	For the late outcome of bile reflux, there was a nonsignificant trend favoring the no-drainage group. The scintographic gastric emptying time, expressed as a ratio (pyloric drainage/no drainage), was 0. 53.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Data synthesized from existing RCTs show that pyloric drainage procedures reduce the occurrence of early postoperative gastric outlet obstruction after esophagectomy with gastric reconstruction, but they have little effect on other early and late patient outcomes.

Case series	Background: Esophagogastrectomy (EG) is a formidable operation with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Risk factor analyses have been performed, but few studies have produced strategies that have improved operative results.
Case series	This study was performed in order to identify prognostic variables that might be used to develop a strategy for optimizing outcomes after EG.
Case series	Methods: The records of all patients (n = 379) who underwent EG patients at a tertiary medical center between 1996 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed.
Case series	Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were determined, and multivariable logistical regression analysis assessed the effect of preoperative and postoperative variables on early mortality.
Case series	Results: Operations included Ivor Lewis (n = 179), transhiatal (n = 130), and other approaches (n = 70). Operative mortality was 5. 8%; 64% experienced complications, including respiratory complications (28.
Case series	5%), anastamotic strictures (25%), and leak (14%). Increasing age, anastomotic leak, Charlson comorbidity index 3, worse swallowing scores, and pneumonia were associated with increased risk of mortality by univariate analysis.
Case series	However, only age (p = 0. 002) and pneumonia (p = 0. 0008) were independently associated with mortality by multivariable analysis. Pneumonia was associated with a 20% incidence of death.
Case series	Patients with pneumonia had significantly worse deglutition and anastomotic integrity on barium esophagogram compared with patients without pneumonia (p < 0. 001, Mann-Whitney rank sum test).
Case series	Conclusions: Morbidity and mortality of EG are significant, but most complications, including anastomotic leak, are not independent predictors of mortality. The most important complication after EG is pneumonia.
Case series	Strategies to decrease postoperative mortality should include careful assessment of swallowing abnormalities and predisposition to aspiration by cineradiography or fiberoptic endoscopy.
Case series	After EG, acceptable pharyngeal function and airway protection should be verified before resuming oral intake.
Case series	Reducing hospital morbidity and mortality following esophagectomy
Case series	Background: The aim of this study was to report the frequency of post-operative recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) following resection for esophageal carcinoma. Patients and methods: Four hundred and four patients were studied.
Case series	Diagnosis of post-operative RLNP was performed by indirect laryngoscopy. Tumour characteristics, surgical approach and perioperative morbidity and mortality following esophageal resection were recorded.
Case series	Results: Sixty patients were diagnosed with post-operative RLNP, of whom 47 had a unilateral and 16 a bilateral lesion.
Case series	RLNP was more frequently diagnosed after transhiatal resection with cervical esophagogastrostomy as compared to abdomino-thoracic resection (p=0. 06).
Case series	A higher rate of post-operative pneumonia was evident in patients with RLNP (33 of 63 as opposed to 90 of 341; p=0. 027).
Case series	Conclusion: RLNP is associated with a significant morbidity, especially pulmonary complications after resection of esophageal cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the impact of early oral feeding (EOF) on postoperative cardiac, respiratory, and gastrointestinal (CRG) complications after McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Summary background data: Nil-by-mouth with enteral tube feeding is routinely practiced after esophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients were randomly allocated to receive oral feeding on the first postoperative day (EOF group) or late oral feeding (LOF group) 7 days after surgery.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative CRG complications, and the secondary outcomes included bowel function recovery and short-term quality of life (QOL).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Between February 2014 and October 2015, 280 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 140 patients in the EOF group and 140 patients in the LOF group. EOF was noninferior to LOF for CRG complications (30. 0% in the EOF group vs. 32.
randomized controlled trial	9% in the LOF group; 95% confidence interval of the difference: -13. 8% to 8. 0%). Compared with the LOF group, the EOF group showed significantly shorter time to first flatus (median of 2 days vs. 3 days, P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	001) and bowel movement (median of 3 vs. 4 days, P < 0. 001). Two weeks after the operation, patients in the EOF group reported higher global QOL and function scores and lower symptom scores than patients in the LOF group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: In patients after McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy is noninferior to the standard of care with regard to postoperative CRG complications.
randomized controlled trial	In addition, patients in the EOF group had a quicker recovery of bowel function and improved short-term QOL.
randomized controlled trial	Early Oral Feeding Following McKeown Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy: An Open-label, Randomized, Controlled, Noninferiority Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Trials of beta blockers in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery have reported conflicting results.
randomized controlled trial	This randomised controlled trial, done in 190 hospitals in 23 countries, was designed to investigate the effects of perioperative beta blockers.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We randomly assigned 8351 patients with, or at risk of, atherosclerotic disease who were undergoing non-cardiac surgery to receive extended-release metoprolol succinate (n=4174) or placebo (n=4177), by a computerised randomisation phone service.
randomized controlled trial	Study treatment was started 2-4 h before surgery and continued for 30 days. Patients, health-care providers, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators were masked to treatment allocation.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal cardiac arrest. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00182039.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: All 8351 patients were included in analyses; 8331 (99. 8%) patients completed the 30-day follow-up. Fewer patients in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group reached the primary endpoint (244 [5.
randomized controlled trial	8%] patients in the metoprolol group vs 290 [6. 9%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0. 84, 95% CI 0. 70-0. 99; p=0. 0399). Fewer patients in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group had a myocardial infarction (176 [4. 2%] vs 239 [5.
randomized controlled trial	7%] patients; 0. 73, 0. 60-0. 89; p=0. 0017). However, there were more deaths in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group (129 [3. 1%] vs 97 [2. 3%] patients; 1. 33, 1. 03-1. 74; p=0. 0317).
randomized controlled trial	More patients in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group had a stroke (41 [1. 0%] vs 19 [0. 5%] patients; 2. 17, 1. 26-3. 74; p=0. 0053).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Our results highlight the risk in assuming a perioperative beta-blocker regimen has benefit without substantial harm, and the importance and need for large randomised trials in the perioperative setting.
randomized controlled trial	Patients are unlikely to accept the risks associated with perioperative extended-release metoprolol.

review	This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition).
review	Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs.
review	Grade 2 suggestions imply that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full discussion of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al).
review	Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: we recommend that every hospital develop a formal strategy that addresses the prevention of VTE (Grade 1A).
review	We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A), and we recommend that mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A).
review	For patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A).
review	We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups), with LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC).
review	For patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2. 5; range, 2. 0 to 3.
review	0 (each Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1B), a VKA (target INR, 2. 5; range, 2. 0 to 3. 0) [Grade 1B], or LDUH (Grade 1B).
review	We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for a minimum of 10 days (Grade 1A); for hip arthroplasty and HFS, we recommend continuing thromboprophylaxis > 10 days and up to 35 days (Grade 1A).
review	We recommend that all major trauma and all spinal cord injury (SCI) patients receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).
review	In patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, LDUH, or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A).
review	We recommend that, on admission to the ICU, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE, and that most receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).
review	Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition)
review	Background: VTE is a common cause of preventable death in surgical patients.
review	Methods: We developed recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients by using systematic methods as described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines.
review	Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.
review	Results: We describe several alternatives for stratifying the risk of VTE in general and abdominal-pelvic surgical patients. When the risk for VTE is very low (< 0.
review	5%), we recommend that no specific pharmacologic (Grade 1B) or mechanical (Grade 2C) prophylaxis be used other than early ambulation. For patients at low risk for VTE (∼1.
review	5%), we suggest mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), over no prophylaxis (Grade 2C).
review	For patients at moderate risk for VTE (∼3%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we suggest low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (Grade 2B), low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 2B), or mechanical prophylaxis with IPC (Grade 2C) over no prophylaxis.
review	For patients at high risk for VTE (∼6%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH (Grade 1B) or low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) over no prophylaxis.
review	In these patients, we suggest adding mechanical prophylaxis with elastic stockings or IPC to pharmacologic prophylaxis (Grade 2C).
review	For patients at high risk for VTE undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, we recommend extended-duration, postoperative, pharmacologic prophylaxis (4 weeks) with LMWH over limited-duration prophylaxis (Grade 1B).
review	For patients at moderate to high risk for VTE who are at high risk for major bleeding complications or those in whom the consequences of bleeding are believed to be particularly severe, we suggest use of mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with IPC, over no prophylaxis until the risk of bleeding diminishes and pharmacologic prophylaxis may be initiated (Grade 2C).
review	For patients in all risk groups, we suggest that an inferior vena cava filter not be used for primary VTE prevention (Grade 2C) and that surveillance with venous compression ultrasonography should not be performed (Grade 2C).
review	We developed similar recommendations for other nonorthopedic surgical populations.
review	Conclusions: Optimal thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients will consider the risks of VTE and bleeding complications as well as the values and preferences of individual patients.

review	Aimed at reducing surgical deaths, several initiatives have attempted to establish volume-based referral strategies in high risk surgery.
review	The detailed analysis of the literature of the last 10 years, comprising 13 papers on esophageal cancer, shows a clear reduction in postoperative mortality with increasing case volumes per year.
review	Single papers have analyzed the main reasons for this phenomenon and showed that postoperative complication rates are lower in high-volume hospitals and management of complications is more successful.
review	Further, long-term prognosis is also correlated to case-volume. In conclusion, the analysis shows that only with the experience of more than 20 esophagectomies per year can a significant reduction of the mortality, down to 4. 9%, be achieved.
review	Based on this survey, surgery of esophageal cancer is a task for high-volume hospitals because of decreased postoperative mortality and improved long-term prognosis compared with low volume hospitals.
review	High volume centers for esophagectomy: what is the number needed to achieve low postoperative mortality?
Case series	Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs National Surgical Quality Improvement Program is a unique resource to prospectively analyze surgical outcomes from a cross-section of surgical services nationally.
Case series	We used this database to assess risk factors for morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers from 1991 to 2001.
Case series	Methods: A total of 1,777 patients underwent an esophagectomy at 109 Veterans Affairs hospitals with complete in-hospital and 30-day outcomes recorded. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were completed. Results: Thirty-day mortality was 9.
Case series	8% (174/1,777) and the incidence of one or more of 20 predefined complications was 49. 5% (880/1,777).
Case series	The most frequent postoperative complications were pneumonia in 21% (380/1,777), respiratory failure in 16% (288/1,777), and ventilator support more than 48 hours in 22% (387/1,777).
Case series	Preoperative predictors of mortality based on multivariable analysis included neoadjuvant therapy, blood urea nitrogen level of more than 40 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase level of more than 125 U/L, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, decreased functional status, ascites, and increasing age.
Case series	Preoperative factors impacting morbidity were increasing age, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alkaline phosphatase level of more than 125 U/L, lower serum albumin concentration, increased complexity score, and decreased functional status.
Case series	Intraoperative risk factors for mortality included the need for transfusion; intraoperative risk factors for morbidity included the need for transfusion and longer operative time.
Case series	Conclusions: These data constitute the largest prospective outcomes cohort in the literature and document a near 50% morbidity rate and 10% mortality rate after esophagectomy.
Case series	Data from this study can be used to better stratify patients before esophagectomy.
Case series	Outcomes after esophagectomy: a ten-year prospective cohort
Case series	Background: Objective reporting of postoperative complications is the foundation of surgical quality assurance.
Case series	We developed a system to identify both presence and severity of thoracic morbidity and mortality, and evaluated its feasibility and utility over the first two years of its implementation.
Case series	Methods: The system was based on the Clavien-Dindo classification, in which the severity of a complication is proportional to the effort to treat it. Definitions were developed by peer review and questionnaire.
Case series	All patients undergoing thoracic surgery (January 2008 to December 2009) were prospectively evaluated.
Case series	Results: A total of 953 patients (mean age 61 years; range, 14 to 95) underwent thoracic surgery (total # cases 1260), of which 369 patients had at least one complication (29. 3% procedures).
Case series	Grades I and II include minor complications requiring no therapy or pharmacologic intervention only. Grades III and IV are major complications that require surgical intervention or life support. Grade V complications result in patient death.
Case series	Grades I, II, III, and IV complications comprised 4. 9%, 63. 9%, 21. 1%, and 7. 8% of all complications; overall mortality rate (grade V) was 2. 2%. The most common complications were prolonged air leak (18. 8%) and atrial fibrillation (18.
Case series	2%) after pulmonary resection, and atrial fibrillation (11. 5%) after esophagectomy-gastrectomy.
Case series	Prolonged air leak led to a major complication (13%), readmission (17%), or prolonged hospital stay (29%) to a greater extent than atrial fibrillation (3%, 2%, and 7%, respectively).
Case series	Conclusions: This standardized classification system for identifying presence and severity of thoracic surgical complications is feasible, facilitates objective comparison, identifies burden of illness of individual complications, and provides an effective method for continuous surgical quality assessment.
Case series	Systematic classification of morbidity and mortality after thoracic surgery
Cohort study	Objective: There are few data on whether prior fundoplication has an impact on subsequent esophageal resection and reconstruction. The aim of this study is to review our experience with patients undergoing esophagectomy after previous fundoplication.
Cohort study	Methods: Medical records were reviewed of all patients undergoing esophageal resection from 1988 to 2008 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients with a fundoplication before esophagectomy were compared with a matched control group who had esophagectomy alone.
Cohort study	Results: There were 2313 esophageal resections, and 80 patients had undergone at least 1 previous anti-reflux surgery. Indications for esophagectomy were benign stricture/perforation in 41 patients, cancer in 28 patients, and dysplasia in 11 patients.
Cohort study	The surgical approach was Ivor Lewis in 38 patients, left thoracoabdominal in 29 patients, transhiatal in 10 patients, and McKeown in 3 patients.
Cohort study	The conduit used was stomach in 70 patients, jejunum in 6 patients, and colon in 3 patients; 1 patient had a diversion and cervical esophagostomy only. Operative mortality occurred in 3 patients (3. 7%).
Cohort study	Postoperative complications occurred in 50 patients (62. 5%), including anastomotic leak in 17 (21. 5%). Sixteen patients (20%) required reoperation for complications.
Cohort study	Complication, anastomotic leak, and reoperation rates were significantly higher in patients with anti-reflux surgery before esophagectomy compared with matched controls.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Esophagectomy after prior anti-reflux surgery is challenging, but the stomach is usually a suitable conduit for esophageal replacement.
Cohort study	Patients with a history of anti-reflux surgery who undergo esophagectomy are at significantly increased risk for postoperative complications, anastomotic leak, and need for reoperation.
Cohort study	Esophagectomy after anti-reflux surgery
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy has a negative influence on health-related quality of life (HRQL) during the first postoperative year, but it is not known how chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy treatment before surgery affects HRQL.
Case series	The current study examined HRQL during preoperative chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy treatment and compared postoperative recovery of HRQL in patients undergoing combined treatment with patients undergoing surgery alone.
Case series	Methods: One hundred three patients completed standardized HRQL measures before and during neoadjuvant treatment and before and after surgery.
Case series	Mean HRQL scores were calculated and preoperative scores were used to model postoperative ratings using linear regression. Results: Deterioration in most aspects of HRQL occurred during preoperative chemotherapy.
Case series	Patients proceeding to concomitant radiotherapy further deteriorated with specific problems with reflux symptoms and role function (difference between means >15, P < 0. 01).
Case series	After neoadjuvant treatment, but before surgery, HRQL returned to baseline levels. Six weeks after surgery, patients reported marked reductions in physical, role, and social function (difference between means > 30, P < 0.
Case series	01) and increase in fatigue, nausea and emesis, pain, dyspnea, appetite loss, and coughing (difference between means > 15, P < 0. 01).
Case series	Recovery of HRQL was not hampered by preoperative treatment, and fewer problems with postoperative nausea, emesis, and dysphagia were reported by patients who had undergone neoadjuvant treatment compared with patients who had undergone surgery alone.
Case series	Conclusions: Preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy had a negative impact on HRQL that was restored in patients proceeding to surgery. Recovery of HRQL after esophagectomy was not impaired by neoadjuvant treatment.
Case series	These results supported the use of neoadjuvant treatment before surgery.
Case series	Health-related quality of life during neoadjuvant treatment and surgery for localized esophageal carcinoma
Cohort study	Background: Quality of life (QL) measurement provides detailed information about outcome from the patient's perspective.
Cohort study	This study assessed the impact on short and long term QL of esophagectomy and palliative treatment in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Cohort study	Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing potentially curative esophagectomy or purely palliative treatment completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and the dysphagia scale from the EORTC QLQ-OES24 before treatment and at regular intervals until death or for 3 postoperative years.
Cohort study	Median scores were calculated for patients surviving more than 2 years after surgery (n = 17), for patients surviving less than 2 years after esophagectomy (n = 38), and for patients undergoing palliative treatment (n = 37).
Cohort study	Results: Baseline functional and symptom QL scores were similar in both groups of patients undergoing esophagectomy, and these were better than scores from patients selected for palliative treatment.
Cohort study	Six weeks after esophagectomy, patients reported worse functional, symptom, and global QL scores than before treatment.
Cohort study	In patients who survived at least 2 years, QL scores returned to preoperative levels within 9 months, but patients who died within 2 years of surgery never regained their former QL.
Cohort study	In both groups, dysphagia improved after surgery and the improvement was maintained until death or for the duration of the study. Patients undergoing palliative treatment reported gradual deterioration in most aspects of QL until death.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Esophagectomy has a negative impact on QL; this effect is transient for patients who survive for 2 or more years. This finding should be considered when selecting patients for surgery.
Cohort study	A prospective longitudinal study examining the quality of life of patients with esophageal carcinoma
Cohort study	Purpose: To assess 3 years of quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer in a randomized trial comparing limited transhiatal resection with extended transthoracic resection.
Cohort study	Patients and methods: Quality-of-life questionnaires were sent at baseline and at 5 weeks; 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, and 3 years after surgery.
Cohort study	Physical and psychological symptoms, activity level, and global quality of life were assessed with the disease-specific Rotterdam Symptom Checklist. Generic quality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-20.
Cohort study	Results: A total of 199 patients participated. Physical symptoms and activity level declined after the operation and gradually returned toward baseline within the first year (P <. 01).
Cohort study	Psychological well-being consistently improved after baseline (P <. 01), whereas global quality of life showed a small initial decline followed by continuous gradual improvement (P <. 01). Quality of life stabilized in the second and third year.
Cohort study	Three months after the operation, patients in the transhiatal esophagectomy group (n = 96) reported fewer physical symptoms (P =. 01) and better activity levels (P <.
Cohort study	01) than patients in the transthoracic group (n = 103), but no differences were found at any other measurement point. For psychological symptoms and global quality of life, no differences were found at any follow-up measurement.
Cohort study	A similar pattern was found for generic quality of life. Conclusion: No lasting differences in quality of life of patients who underwent either transhiatal or transthoracic resection were found.
Cohort study	Compared with baseline, quality of life declined after the operation but was restored within a year in both groups.
Cohort study	Quality of life after transhiatal compared with extended transthoracic resection for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
Cohort study	Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes are important in assessing new approaches to the treatment of cancer. Neoadjuvant therapy is being used increasingly before surgery in patients with localized oesophageal cancer.
Cohort study	This prospective non-randomized study evaluated HRQL in patients treated by preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by surgery (multimodal therapy) or by surgery alone.
Cohort study	Methods: Data from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaires QLQ-30 and QLQ-OES24 were collected prospectively.
Cohort study	Questionnaires were completed at diagnosis, after chemoradiotherapy where applicable, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.
Cohort study	Results: The study included 202 consecutive patients with oesophageal cancer considered suitable for curative (R0) resection at the time of staging. Eighty-seven patients received chemotherapy combined with external-beam radiotherapy before surgery.
Cohort study	At baseline, 75 (86 percent) of 87 patients in the multimodal group completed questionnaires, compared with 72 (62. 6 percent) of 115 in the surgery-alone group. There were no significant differences in baseline global HRQL scores between groups.
Cohort study	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly reduced physical (P=0. 004) and role (P=0. 007) functioning before surgery, despite a significant (P=0. 043) improvement in the dysphagia score.
Cohort study	Oesophageal resection had a negative impact on global, functional and symptom HRQL scores at 3 months in both groups.
Cohort study	Most variables had recovered by 6 months in the two groups, but at 12 months physical and role functioning remained impaired in the surgery-alone group, and social functioning and financial worries in the multimodal group.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Although the multimodal regimen had a negative impact on HRQL before surgery, postoperative quality of life in patients who had multimodal therapy was similar to that in those who had surgery alone.
Cohort study	Prospective evaluation of quality of life in patients with localized oesophageal cancer treated by multimodality therapy or surgery alone
Case series	To assess quality of life (QoL) and symptoms after oesophageal cancer surgery, a prospective nationwide population-based study was conducted in 2001-2005, including most surgically treated oesophageal cancer patients in Sweden.
Case series	Six months postoperatively patients responded to an EORTC quality of life core questionnaire (QLQ C-30) with an oesophageal-specific module (OES-18). Mean scores were calculated. Mann-Whitney test was used for group comparisons.
Case series	Among 282 patients, QoL was considerably reduced compared to a reference general population (P<0. 001), and functioning scales were similarly negatively affected; particularly role (P<0. 001) and social (P<0. 001) functions.
Case series	Younger patients scored worse than older. No gender differences were found. Dominating general symptoms included fatigue, appetite loss, diarrhoea, and dyspnoea, each significantly more pronounced than the general population (P<0. 001).
Case series	Eating problems, cough, reflux, and oesophageal pain were common oesophageal-specific symptoms.
Case series	Thus, patients who undergo oesophageal cancer resection suffer greatly from reduced QoL and several general and oesophageal-specific symptoms six months postoperatively.
Case series	Quality of life and persisting symptoms after oesophageal cancer surgery
review	Background: Esophagectomy for cancer offers a chance of cure but is associated with morbidity, at least a temporary reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQL), and a 5-year survival of approximately 30%.
review	This research evaluated how and whether HRQL outcomes contribute to surgical decision making.
review	Methods: A systematic review identified randomized trials and longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that assessed HRQL after esophagectomy with multidimensional validated questionnaires.
review	Articles were independently evaluated by two reviewers, and the value of HRQL in clinical decision making was categorized in three ways: (1) the assessment of the quality of HRQL methodology according to predefined criteria; (2) the influence of HRQL outcomes on treatment recommendations and/or informed consent; and (3) the HRQL after esophagectomy for cancer in methodologically robust studies.
review	Results: Eighteen publications were identified, of which 16 (89%) were categorized as having robust HRQL design. Of these studies, 3 concluded that HRQL influenced treatment recommendations and 11 (including the former 3) informed patient consent.
review	The remaining five papers were well designed, but the authors did not use HRQL to influence treatment recommendations or informed consent. After esophagectomy, patients report major deterioration in most aspects of HRQL with slow recovery.
review	Conclusion: HRQL outcomes are relevant to surgical decision making. Methods to communicate HRQL outcomes to patients are required to inform consent and clinical practice.
review	The role of health-related quality of life outcomes in clinical decision making in surgery for esophageal cancer: a systematic review
Case series	Background: The aim of the study was to assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with surgically cured oesophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: A Swedish nationwide cohort of patients undergoing oesophagectomy for cancer between April 2001 and January 2004 was studied prospectively, and compared with a Swedish age- and sex-adjusted reference population.
Case series	Validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaires were used to assess HRQL at 6 months and 3 years after surgery.
Case series	A mean score difference of 10 or more between groups was considered clinically relevant and tested further for statistical significance. Results: Of 358 patients, 117 (32. 7 per cent) survived for at least 3 years. Of these, 87 patients (74.
Case series	4 per cent) responded to the questionnaires. Six months after surgery, most aspects of HRQL were substantially worse than in the reference population with no improvement at 3 years.
Case series	Patients alive at 3 years reported significantly poorer role and social function, and significantly more problems with fatigue, diarrhoea, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, than in the reference population.
Case series	Conclusion: HRQL in long-term survivors after oesophagectomy does not improve between 6 months and 3 years after surgery, and is worse than that in a comparable reference population.
Case series	Long-term health-related quality of life following surgery for oesophageal cancer
Case series	Purpose: To identify factors predictive of health-related quality of life (HRQL) 6 months after surgery for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Patients and methods: A Swedish nationwide population-based study of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer was undertaken between 2001 and 2005.
Case series	Clinical details (sex, age, body mass index [BMI], comorbidity) and tumor details (histology, stage, and location) were prospectively recorded and validated.
Case series	HRQL questionnaires (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires C30 and OES18) were used to assess HRQL 6 months postoperatively.
Case series	HRQL outcome was categorized as good or poor by collapsing the four response categories.
Case series	Logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounding factors were used to assess the association between preoperative patient and tumor characteristics and HRQL outcome 6 months after surgery.
Case series	Results: A total of 355 patients (77% of eligible) responded to the HRQL questionnaires.
Case series	Age, sex, and BMI showed no associations with HRQL 6 months after surgery, but patients with comorbidity, a more advanced tumor stage (III to IV), or a tumor located in the middle or upper esophagus had an increased risk of poor HRQL.
Case series	Patients with adenocarcinoma had a lower risk of poor HRQL than patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion: Knowledge of risk factors for poor postoperative HRQL may be relevant for clinical decision making.
Case series	More research to see whether these factors are further predictive of poor HRQL in long-term survivors is needed.
Case series	Predictors of postoperative quality of life after esophagectomy for cancer
Case series	Introduction: The aim of our study was to assess the quality of life as well as secondary cancers/diseases and esophagectomy-related or unrelated interventions in the long-term course of surgery.
Case series	Patients and methods: Out of 417 patients who underwent esophageal resection for cancer between September 1985 and November 2003, 85 were defined as long-term survivors (≥5 years).
Case series	Fifty patients still alive in November 2008 complied with our inclusion criteria. The general (QLQ-C 30, version 3. 0) as well as the esophagus specific quality of life (QLQ-OES 18) were analyzed with the help of the EORTC QLQ-questionnaires.
Case series	Results: The median observation interval since the operation was 100. 1 (range 60-238) months. A median Global Health Status of quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C 30) of 66. 7 was found (range 16. 7-100). Among the functioning scores, emotional (83.
Case series	3 (range 16. 7-100)) and cognitive functioning (83. 3 (range 0-100)) were highest.
Case series	The esophagus-specific quality of life (EORTC QLQ-OES 18) revealed a median value (scale 0-100) of 0 each for dysphagia and difficulties with swallowing saliva, whilst reflux was a major problem with a score of 50. 0 (range 0-100).
Case series	Conclusion: Our results show that long-term survival with a good quality of life is possible after curative esophagectomy for carcinoma.
Case series	Long-term survivors of esophageal cancer: disease-specific quality of life, general health and complications
Cohort study	Curative treatment of esophageal cancer with definitive or preoperative high-dose chemoradiotherapy inflicts a major strain on the patients with potentially severe physical, emotional, and social consequences.
Cohort study	The aim of this study was to assess various aspects of quality of life and fatigue in long-term survivors following such a treatment.
Cohort study	Patients undergoing a potentially curative treatment between 1996 and 2007, and still alive (n= 41) completed quality of life questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and esophageal cancer module (QLQ-OES18).
Cohort study	Twenty patients were treated by surgery alone, and 21 patients were scheduled for high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Five of those patients did not undergo planned surgery.
Cohort study	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy consisted of three courses of chemotherapy, cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) and 5-fluorouracil 5000 mg/m(2) in each course and concomitant radiotherapy of a median dose 66 Gy.
Cohort study	Quality of life in esophageal cancer patients receiving high-dose chemoradiotherapy was compared with that for esophageal cancer patients who received only surgery, head and neck cancer patients, laryngectomized patients, and a random sample of the general Norwegian population.
Cohort study	Esophageal cancer patients treated by high-dose chemoradiotherapy had significantly worse global quality of life as reflected by almost all functional scales and higher fatigue compared with esophageal cancer patients who received surgery alone, head and neck cancer patients, and the general Norwegian population.
Cohort study	There were no significant differences in quality of life between the esophageal cancer patients receiving high-dose chemoradiotherapy and the laryngectomy patients.
Cohort study	Further, the esophageal cancer patients receiving high-dose chemoradiotherapy had higher intensity of other symptoms like general pain, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation compared with the esophageal cancer patients who received surgery alone, head and neck cancer patients, and the general Norwegian population.
Cohort study	High-dose chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil had a considerable negative long-term effect on global quality of life in patients with resectable esophageal cancer. Fatigue was a prominent long-lasting symptom in these patients.
Cohort study	Health-related quality of life in long-term survivors after high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in esophageal cancer
Case series	Purpose: To evaluate the effect of major postoperative complications on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in 5-year survivors of esophageal cancer surgery.
Case series	Patients and methods: This study was based on the Swedish Esophageal and Cardia Cancer register with almost complete nationwide coverage and data on esophageal cancer surgery collected prospectively between 2001 and 2005.
Case series	Patients who were alive 5 years after surgery were eligible.
Case series	HRQL was assessed longitudinally until 5 years after surgery by using the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and OES18.
Case series	Linear mixed models were used to assess the mean score difference (MD) with 95% CIs of each aspect of HRQL in patients with or without major postoperative complications. Adjustment was made for several potential confounders.
Case series	Results: Of 153 patients who survived 5 years, 141 patients (92%) answered the 5-year HRQL questionnaires. Of these individuals, 46 patients (33%) sustained a major postoperative complication.
Case series	Dyspnea (MD, 15; 95% CI, 6 to 23), fatigue (MD, 13; 95% CI, 5 to 20), and eating restrictions (MD, 10; 95% CI, 2 to 17) were clinically and statistically significantly deteriorated throughout the follow-up in patients with major postoperative complications compared with patients without major complications.
Case series	Although problems with choking declined to levels comparable with patients without major postoperative complications, sleep difficulties and gastroesophageal reflux progressively worsened during follow-up.
Case series	Conclusion: The occurrence of postoperative complications exerts a long-lasting negative effect on HRQL in patients who survive 5 years after esophagectomy for cancer.
Case series	Influence of major postoperative complications on health-related quality of life among long-term survivors of esophageal cancer surgery
Case series	Purpose: To clarify whether health-related quality of life (HRQL) can be restored in 5-year survivors of esophageal cancer surgery.
Case series	Patients and methods: The nationwide Swedish prospective and population-based cohort for this study consisted of patients with esophageal cancer who were treated surgically between 2001 and 2005 and were alive 5 years after surgery.
Case series	The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ-OES18 (the disease site-specific module for esophageal cancer) were used to assess HRQL 6 months, 3 years, and 5 years postoperatively.
Case series	Paired t tests were used to evaluate changes in HRQL over time. Patients' HRQL was classified as improved, stable, or deteriorated.
Case series	Multivariable linear regression was used to calculate mean score difference in HRQL with 95% CIs between patients and a background population according to HRQL category.
Case series	Results: Among 153 eligible patients alive after 5 years, 117 (76%) answered all HRQL assessments. Among a random sample of 6,969 Swedish adults representing the corresponding background population, 4,910 (70. 5%) participated.
Case series	For most patients, HRQL remained stable or improved over time, and their HRQL was comparable to that of the background population. Patients who deteriorated over time reported large and clinically significant mean score differences for all measures.
Case series	For example, 5 years after surgery, physical function was stable or improved in 86% of patients and their mean score (87) was similar to that of the background population (88), but the 14% who deteriorated had a substantially lower mean score of 56.
Case series	Conclusion: HRQL recovers to a level comparable to that in the background population in most patients who survive 5 years after esophagectomy for cancer, although a subgroup of patients has substantially worse HRQL.
Case series	Health-related quality of life among 5-year survivors of esophageal cancer surgery: a prospective population-based study
Case series	Purpose: A prospective study of preoperative tumor-node-metastasis staging of patients with esophageal cancer (EC) was designed to compare the accuracy of 18-F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with conventional noninvasive modalities.
Case series	Patients and methods: Seventy-four patients with carcinomas of the esophagus (n = 43) or gastroesophageal junction (n = 31) were studied.
Case series	All patients underwent attenuation-corrected FDG-PET imaging, a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Results: FDG-PET demonstrated increased activity in the primary tumor in 70 of 74 patients (sensitivity: 95%).
Case series	False-negative PET images were found in four patients with T1 lesions. Thirty-four patients (46%) had stage IV disease.
Case series	FDG-PET had a higher accuracy for diagnosing stage IV disease compared with the combination of CT and EUS (82% v 64%, respectively; P: =. 004).
Case series	FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 16 (22%) of 74 patients by upstaging 11 (15%) and downstaging five (7%) patients.
Case series	Thirty-nine (53%) of the 74 patients underwent a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy in conjunction with primary curative esophagectomy. In these patients, tumoral involvement was found in 21 local and 35 regional or distant lymph nodes (LN).
Case series	For local LN, the sensitivity of FDG-PET was lower than EUS (33% v 81%, respectively; P: =. 027), but the specificity may have been higher (89% v 67%, respectively; P: = not significant [NS]).
Case series	For the assessment of regional and distant LN involvement, compared with the combined use of CT and EUS, FDG-PET had a higher specificity (90% v 98%, respectively; P: =. 025) and a similar sensitivity (46% v 43%, respectively; P: = NS).
Case series	Conclusion: PET significantly improves the detection of stage IV disease in EC compared with the conventional staging modalities. PET improves diagnostic specificity for LN staging.
Case series	Utility of positron emission tomography for the staging of patients with potentially operable esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Although EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are both used in the staging of esophageal cancer, the utility of routinely performing both tests is unclear.
Case series	Objectives: The primary aim of the study was to determine the benefit of routine FDG-PET for esophageal cancer nodal staging in patients undergoing EUS-FNA.
Case series	The secondary objective was to determine EUS criteria that selectively identify patients in whom PET yields additional information. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Tertiary-care academic medical center.
Case series	Patients and interventions: All patients who underwent both EUS and PET for initial staging of esophageal cancer between April 2003 and August 2007. Main outcome measurements: EUS and PET detection of malignant lymph nodes and distant metastases.
Case series	Results: Of 242 patients who underwent esophageal EUS for a malignant indication, 148 also underwent PET within 30 days.
Case series	EUS detected locoregional-node disease by EUS criteria or cytology in 92 patients, and PET was positive in a minority of these patients (n = 41 [45%]).
Case series	For celiac-node staging, PET was positive in 2 of 17 patients (12%) with celiac-node involvement detected by EUS. EUS was also significantly more sensitive than PET in the detection of nodal disease confirmed by cytology or histology (86% vs 44%).
Case series	PET did not alter nodal staging in any patient with complete EUS-FNA. PET identified distant metastases only in those patients with incomplete EUS or nodal disease detected by EUS. Limitations: Single institution, retrospective analysis.
Case series	Conclusions: The addition of PET to a complete EUS examination did not alter regional-node or celiac-node staging. PET performance in overall staging is strongly associated with EUS assessment of lymph nodes.
Case series	Routine positron emission tomography does not alter nodal staging in patients undergoing EUS-guided FNA for esophageal cancer
Case series	Endosonography was performed preoperatively in 111 patients with an esophageal carcinoma. The results were correlated with the histology of resected specimens employing the new (1987) TNM classification.
Case series	Endosonography was accurate in assessing the depth of tumor infiltration (overall accuracy: 89%). Early carcinomas could be distinguished from advanced cancer.
Case series	Extensive stenosis preventing the passage of the instrument was a limiting factor prior to the availability of a small-caliber catheter echoprobe (25% of cases).
Case series	Endosonography was helpful for diagnosing lymph node metastasis, but was less accurate in defining non-metastatic enlarged lymph nodes (accuracy: 81%, sensitivity 95% and specificity 50%).
Case series	The incidence of lymph node metastasis increased with the progression of tumor infiltration. Endosonography was also less accurate for diagnosing liver metastases and peritoneal dissemination because of the low depth of penetration of ultrasound.
Case series	Technical improvements such as a reduction in the diameter of the instrument will further enhance the accuracy of endosonography. Moreover, ES-guided cytology may become helpful for confirming the ES diagnosis of lymph node metastasis.
Case series	Preoperative TNM classification of esophageal carcinoma by endosonography
Case series	The value of endosonography (ES) for diagnosing the stage of oesophageal carcinoma was analysed in 180 patients with this form of cancer (161 men and 19 women; mean age 57 [41-73] years). The tumour stenosis could not be passed in 54 patients (30%).
Case series	Primary resection of the tumour was possible in 97 patients (53. 9%). It is in these latter cases that the results of endosonography and histological findings in the resected specimen were compared.
Case series	The sensitivity of ES for the depth of infiltration of the primary tumour was 85%, while for involvement of regional lymph nodes it was 75%.
Case series	In those cases in which ES could be applied only at the tumour stenosis but not beyond, the staging sensitivity was 72%. According to the ES findings, R0-resection should have been possible in 87 of 97 patients (89.
Case series	7%), but on the basis of the histological findings in only 65 patients (67%). Nonetheless, ES is at present the most accurate method of judging resectability and thus of formulating a multimodal preoperative treatment concept.
Case series	[What is the value of endosonography in the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma?]
Case series	We compared the results of endoscopic sonography and CT in the preoperative staging of 46 patients with esophageal carcinoma studied prospectively. All patients had surgery and 44 had pathologic examination of the mediastinal and celiac lymph nodes.
Case series	The results of CT and endoscopic sonography were compared with surgical and pathologic findings. A total of 51 tumors were found in 46 patients.
Case series	Sonographic estimation of tumor extension through the different layers of the esophagus was correct in 37 (73%) of all 51 tumors and in 22 (85%) of the 26 tumors in which the examination was complete.
Case series	The echoendoscope (13-mm diameter) could not pass through the tumor in 23 cases (50%). Infiltration to adjacent organs was found in 15 cases at surgery.
Case series	In four of these 15, the extension was detected by CT; in seven of the 15 cases, it was detected by sonography. False-negative determination of tumor extension occurred with endoscopic sonography in patients with stenotic tumor.
Case series	There were no false-positive results with either CT or endoscopic sonography. For detection of mediastinal lymph-node involvement, the sensitivity of CT was 48%.
Case series	The sensitivity of sonography was 50% if metastatic nodes unexplored by sonography were included, or 84% if only cases in which stenosis was passed were considered.
Case series	Statistical comparison revealed that sonography was superior to CT for the detection of metastases to lymph nodes. CT and endoscopic sonography provide complementary information.
Case series	When the echoendoscope can be maneuvered past the tumor, sonography can be used accurately to define extension through the layers of the esophagus, extension to the adjacent organs, and involvement of the lymph nodes.
Case series	When the tumor cannot be passed by the echoendoscope, CT is superior to sonography for detection of mediastinal extension.
Case series	Staging of esophageal carcinoma: comparison of results with endoscopic sonography and CT
Case series	Fifty consecutive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proved by means of biopsy underwent preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasonography (US).
Case series	Dynamic computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen was performed before surgery in 33 of the patients.
Case series	In all 50 patients, the TNM classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer was used to compare the imaging findings with pathologic findings in specimens resected at surgery.
Case series	When the depth of tumor penetration was evaluated, the findings at endoscopic US and those at pathologic examination were concordant in 46 of 50 patients (92%), and the findings at dynamic CT and those at pathologic examination, in 14 of 33 patients (42%) (P less than.
Case series	00042). Evaluation of regional lymph node metastases showed a concordance of 78% with endoscopic US and 48% with dynamic CT (P less than. 038).
Case series	Overall determination of stage with both dynamic CT and endoscopic US showed a concordance of 73%, compared with a concordance of 45% for dynamic CT alone (P less than. 028).
Case series	Preoperative staging of gastric cancer: comparison of endoscopic US and dynamic CT
Case series	To assess the accuracy and limitations of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative staging of esophageal and gastric carcinoma, we performed a prospective controlled study over a five year period.
Case series	Data from 63 patients with esophageal cancer and 147 patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery were available for comparison of the endosonographic TNM classification to the histophathological findings of the resected specimens.
Case series	The overall accuracy of EUS in the assessment of tumor infiltration depth was 85. 7% and 78% in esophageal and gastric cancer, respectively.
Case series	The sensitivity of EUS in the detection of regional lymph node metastases was 90% in esophageal and 87% in gastric carcinoma.
Case series	The most frequent causes of misdiagnoses by endosonography were microscopic tumor invasion and peritumorous inflammatory changes. The inability to traverse a tumor stenosis restricted the endosonographic evaluation in 31.
Case series	6 and 14% of the cases with esophageal and gastric cancer, respectively.
Case series	Endosonography for preoperative locoregional staging of esophageal and gastric cancer
Case series	Eighty-eight patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (N = 44), stomach (N = 41), and duodenum (N = 3) who underwent surgery were pre-operatively examined by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).
Case series	The ability of EUS to accurately predict the T stage and the N stage was 82% and 70% for esophageal carcinoma, 71% and 75% for gastric cancer, and 100% and 66% for duodenal malignancy.
Case series	In esophageal carcinoma, the accuracy of T staging was only slightly lower in cases with non-traversable tumor stenoses (77%) compared with traversable carcinomas (84%).
Case series	This was probably due to the fact that all non-traversable tumors were either in stage T3 or T4.
Case series	The accuracy of EUS in predicting the stages T1 to T3, which correspond to R0 resectability (no macroscopic or microscopic tumor remains), was 92% for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and 85% for gastric cancer.
Case series	However, in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, R0 resection was possible in only 66% of all cases, whereas EUS predicted an 84% R0 resection rate.
Case series	In adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and stomach, EUS prediction of stages T1 to T3 correlated well with the actual rate of R0 resection.
Case series	These results show that EUS is a reliable diagnostic method for the local staging of upper gastrointestinal cancer. Its impact on treatment and hence on prognosis of patients with these malignancies has yet to be determined.
Case series	Local staging and assessment of resectability in carcinoma of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum by endoscopic ultrasonography
Case series	In 20 patients with normal esophagi, spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to determine the appearance at different pulse sequences and T1 and T2 values.
Case series	Twelve patients with esophageal carcinoma were also studied by both MR and computed tomography (CT); in ten, there was correlation with surgical and pathologic findings.
Case series	Both MR and CT showed low accuracy in staging the tumors (40% and 70%, respectively), mainly because of difficulty in detecting tumor invasion through the muscle layer into periesophageal fat. Relatively T1-weighted images (repetition time, 0.
Case series	5 second; echo time, 28 msec) were best for depiction of both normal esophageal anatomy and esophageal tumors. T1 and T2 measurements varied widely for both normal and abnormal esophagi and thus were not useful in predicting histologic findings.
Case series	Esophageal imaging by MR and CT: study of normal anatomy and neoplasms
Case series	Thirty-two patients with esophageal spinocellular (squamous cell) carcinoma were studied with superconductive magnet in order to evaluate local and extraluminal extent, as well as mediastinal lymph node spread of the disease.
Case series	In the absence of adenopathy, the localized tumors were considered susceptible to surgical treatment. All patients were operated on within 21 days.
Case series	The resectability criteria were correctly evaluated in 75% of cases; sensitivity and specificity were 86 and 67%, respectively. Unsatisfactory results were obtained in the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathies.
Case series	We conclude that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in the preoperative evaluation of resectability criteria in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Case series	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: MRI evaluation of mediastinum
Case series	MR imaging and CT were performed prospectively in 35 patients with esophageal carcinoma to determine the resectability of the primary tumors, because at our institution patients with resectable tumors have surgery regardless of the presence of distant metastases.
Case series	Tumors with evidence of aortic or tracheobronchial invasion on MR or CT were considered to be unresectable.
Case series	Tracheobronchial invasion was diagnosed when the tumor extended into the lumen of the airway, and aortic invasion was diagnosed when the triangular fat space between the esophagus, aorta, and spine adjacent to the primary tumor was obliterated.
Case series	Two patients were excluded because of suboptimal MR images produced by motion artifacts. Pathologic proof was obtained from either surgery or autopsy in 31 patients.
Case series	Of these, six patients (19%) had proved unresectable tumors (three aortic invasion and three tracheobronchial invasion). In all six cases, these features were correctly detected with both MR and CT.
Case series	One patient had false-positive findings on MR and CT. An indeterminate diagnosis was obtained with MR in three patients and with CT in four patients. These incorrect or indeterminate results were all related to the diagnosis of aortic invasion.
Case series	No patient had a false-negative result. When indeterminate diagnoses were considered false-positive, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for resectability were 100%, 84%, and 87%, respectively, for MR and 100%, 80%, and 84%, respectively, for CT.
Case series	We conclude that MR and CT have nearly the same accuracy in predicting resectability of tumors in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Carcinoma of the esophagus: CT vs MR imaging in determining resectability
Case series	Sixty patients with esophageal cancer infiltration of mediastinal structures and metastasis to lymph nodes were prospectively evaluated by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and then underwent surgical resection of the tumor (n = 57) or diagnostic thoracotomy (n = 3).
Case series	Lymph nodes were excised from standardized locations and examined histologically.
Case series	Sensitivity and specificity of both methods for all criteria were found so low that the value of these methods for planning surgery--or for stratification to different therapeutic arms in comparative studies--must be questioned.
Case series	Assessment of resectability of esophageal cancer by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging
review	A large body of literature has accumulated showing endoscopic ultrasonography to be highly accurate in the locoregional staging of esophageal cancer. Several special aspects and problems of EUS in this setting are also presented in the literature.
review	This article reviews this body of information and presents data from endoscopic staging research.
review	Endosonographic staging of esophageal cancer: a review of literature results
Case series	Introduction: Improvement in esophageal cancer staging is needed. Positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the staging of esophageal carcinoma were compared.
Case series	Methods: PET, CT, and EUS were performed and interpreted prospectively in 75 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer. Either tissue confirmation or fine needle aspiration (FNA) was used as the gold standard of disease.
Case series	Sensitivity and specificity for tumor, nodal, and metastatic (TNM) disease for each test were determined.
Case series	TNM categorizations from each test were used to assign patients to subgroups corresponding to the three treatment plans that patients could theoretically receive, and these were then compared.
Case series	Results: Local tumor staging (T) was done correctly by CT and PET in 42% and by EUS in 71% of patients (P value > 0. 14).
Case series	The sensitivity and specificity for nodal involvement (N) by modality were 84% and 67% for CT, 86% and 67% for EUS, and 82% and 60% for PET (P value > 0. 38).
Case series	The sensitivity and specificity for distant metastasis were 81% and 82% for CT, 73% and 86% for EUS, and 81% and 91% for PET (P value > 0. 25).
Case series	Treatment assignment was done correctly by CT in 65%, by EUS in 75%, and by PET in 70% of patients (P value > 0. 34). Conclusions: EUS had superior T staging ability over PET and CT in our study group.
Case series	The tests showed similar performance in nodal staging and there was a trend toward improved distant disease staging with CT or PET over EUS. Assignment to treatment groups in relation to TNM staging tended to be better by EUS.
Case series	Each test contributed unique patient staging information on an individual basis.
Case series	Comparison of positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound in the initial staging of patients with esophageal cancer
meta analysis	The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in staging of oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	PubMed was searched to identify English-language articles published before January 2006 and reporting on diagnostic performance of EUS, CT, and/or FDG-PET in oesophageal cancer patients.
meta analysis	Articles were included if absolute numbers of true-positive, false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative test results were available or derivable for regional, celiac, and abdominal lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases.
meta analysis	Sensitivities and specificities were pooled using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to study potential effects of study and patient characteristics.
meta analysis	Random effects pooled sensitivities of EUS, CT, and FDG-PET for regional lymph node metastases were 0. 80 (95% confidence interval 0. 75-0. 84), 0. 50 (0. 41-0. 60), and 0. 57 (0. 43-0. 70), respectively, and specificities were 0. 70 (0. 65-0. 75), 0.
meta analysis	83 (0. 77-0. 89), and 0. 85 (0. 76-0. 95), respectively. Diagnostic performance did not differ significantly across these tests. For detection of celiac lymph node metastases by EUS, sensitivity and specificity were 0. 85 (0. 72-0. 99) and 0. 96 (0.
meta analysis	92-1. 00), respectively. For abdominal lymph node metastases by CT, these values were 0. 42 (0. 29-0. 54) and 0. 93 (0. 86-1. 00), respectively. For distant metastases, sensitivity and specificity were 0. 71 (0. 62-0. 79) and 0. 93 (0. 89-0.
meta analysis	97) for FDG-PET and 0. 52 (0. 33-0. 71) and 0. 91 (0. 86-0. 96) for CT, respectively.
meta analysis	Diagnostic performance of FDG-PET for distant metastases was significantly higher than that of CT, which was not significantly affected by study and patient characteristics.
meta analysis	The results suggest that EUS, CT, and FDG-PET each play a distinctive role in the detection of metastases in oesophageal cancer patients.
meta analysis	For the detection of regional lymph node metastases, EUS is most sensitive, whereas CT and FDG-PET are more specific tests. For the evaluation of distant metastases, FDG-PET has probably a higher sensitivity than CT.
meta analysis	Its combined use could however be of clinical value, with FDG-PET detecting possible metastases and CT confirming or excluding their presence and precisely determining the location(s).
meta analysis	Staging investigations for oesophageal cancer: a meta-analysis
Case series	Background and aim: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is established as a standard approach for locoregional staging of esophageal cancer.
Case series	However, only a few published studies have attempted to correlate the station of the abnormal lymph nodes detected by EUS with the definitive histology.
Case series	We compared EUS and computed tomography (CT) in the initial staging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: Consecutive patients with esophageal cancer undergoing EUS were evaluated.
Case series	EUS findings and patient data including histopatology were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Lymph node locations were divided into three groups; abdominal (A), paraesophageal (B), and thoracic paratracheal (C).
Case series	Results: A total of 365 consecutive patients underwent EUS and 159 patients underwent esophagectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Thirty-eight patients were excluded (insufficient EUS, etc. ), and 121 patients were enrolled.
Case series	The overall accuracy of EUS was 64% (sensitivity 68%, specificity 58%, positive predictive value [PPV] 68%), CT was 51% (sensitivity 33%, specificity 75%, PPV 64%), and CT + EUS was 64% (sensitivity 74%, specificity 50%, PPV 66%).
Case series	The accuracy of EUS was higher than CT in Groups A and C. Sensitivity of CT was lower than that of EUS alone and CT + EUS.
Case series	Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that EUS is a more accurate technique than contrast-enhanced CT for detecting abnormal lymph nodes. Sensitivity of CT was lower than that of EUS alone and CT + EUS.
Case series	But some metastatic lymph nodes in neck and abdominal fields are only detectable by CT. Therefore, both EUS and CT should be undertaken for routine examination prior to treatment of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Lymph node staging in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a comparative study of endoscopic ultrasonography versus computed tomography
Case series	The accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is operator-dependent.
Case series	According to learning curve study, the accuracy of EUS T-staging for esophageal cancer has been reported to be greater in an investigator who had performed at least 100 EUS examinations.
Case series	We determined comparative study regarding T-staging accuracy of EUS for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma between expert and nonexpert endoscopic ultrasonographers.
Case series	We retrospectively identified 73 consecutive patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent EUS and endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection, or surgery.
Case series	EUS was performed by expert (Group 1) and nonexpert (Group 2) endoscopic ultrasonographers in multitertiary hospitals. Groups 1 and 2 were 37 and 36 patients during 2005-2011, respectively. Forty-two patients (57.
Case series	5%) of the overall patients underwent surgical exploration. Correct endoscopic ultrasonographic T-staging of Group 1 was observed in 34 (91. 9%) patients, while that of Group 2 was observed in 26 (72. 2%) patients.
Case series	And there was significant difference in correct endoscopic ultrasonographic T-staging between Group 1 and Group 2 (P = 0. 035). The incorrect endoscopic ultrasonographic T-staging of Group 1 were three cases that were overstaging (8.
Case series	1%), but in Group 2 there were seven overstaging (19. 4%) and three understaging (8. 3%). There was no significant difference in overstaging or understaging of incorrect endoscopic ultrasonographic T-staging between Group 1 and Group 2 (P = 0. 528).
Case series	This study first provides evidence that endoscopic ultrasonographic T-staging of nonexpert endoscopic ultrasonographers was inferior to be correct, compared with that of expert endoscopic ultrasonographers.
Case series	EUS staging for esophageal cancer should be performed by expert endoscopic ultrasonographers to provide appropriate management strategy.
Case series	Staging accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound performed by nonexpert endosonographers in patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: is it possible?
Case series	Objectives: To identify the associations of lymph node metastases (pN+), number of positive nodes, and pN subclassification with cancer, treatment, patient, geographic, and institutional variables, and to recommend extent of lymphadenectomy needed to accurately detect pN+ for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Summary background data: Limited data and traditional analytic techniques have precluded identifying intricate associations of pN+ with other cancer, treatment, and patient characteristics.
Case series	Methods: Data on 5806 esophagectomy patients from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration were analyzed by Random Forest machine learning techniques.
Case series	Results: pN+, number of positive nodes, and pN subclassification were associated with increasing depth of cancer invasion (pT), increasing cancer length, decreasing cancer differentiation (G), and more regional lymph nodes resected.
Case series	Lymphadenectomy necessary to accurately detect pN+ is 60 for shorter, well-differentiated cancers (<2. 5 cm) and 20 for longer, poorly differentiated ones.
Case series	Conclusions: In esophageal cancer, pN+, increasing number of positive nodes, and increasing pN classification are associated with deeper invading, longer, and poorly differentiated cancers.
Case series	Consequently, if the goal of lymphadenectomy is to accurately define pN+ status of such cancers, few nodes need to be removed.
Case series	Conversely, superficial, shorter, and well-differentiated cancers require a more extensive lymphadenectomy to accurately define pN+ status.

Case series	Endoscopic ultrasound imaging has potential for improving the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease. However, the anatomic correlates of gastrointestinal ultrasound images have not been precisely defined.
Case series	We have compared ultrasound images with the corresponding histologic sections of 81 specimens of resected and postmortem, normal and diseased gastrointestinal tissue.
Case series	The five layers seen on ultrasound images of the normal gastrointestinal tract correspond to (1) superficial mucosa, (2) deep mucosa, (3) submucosa plus the acoustical interface between the submucosa and muscularis propria, (4) muscularis propria minus the acoustical interface between the submucosa and muscularis propria, and (5) serosa and subserosal fat.
Case series	This interpretation takes into consideration the echoes produced by the tissue layers and the echoes produced by the interfaces between layers.
Case series	Abnormal findings on ultrasound images of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases correspond to histologic tissue structure. When properly interpreted, ultrasound images of the gastrointestinal wall can provide potentially useful diagnostic information.
Case series	Histologic correlates of gastrointestinal ultrasound images
Case series	Background: In diagnosing superficial esophageal carcinoma, it is necessary to differentiate mucosal carcinoma from submucosal carcinoma because mucosal carcinoma has a good prognosis and local treatment is likely to be successful.
Case series	We evaluated an ultrasound probe and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the staging of superficial esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Methods: From October 1992 to September 1994, 22 patients with 25 lesions (7 mucosal carcinomas, 18 submucosal carcinomas) were examined preoperatively with both the probe and EUS.
Case series	The ultrasound findings were compared with histologic findings in all cases.
Case series	Results: The accuracy rates of the depth of invasion by the ultrasound probe were 86% (6 to 7) for mucosal carcinoma and 94% (17 to 18) for submucosal carcinoma, total 92% (23 to 25); by EUS 71% (5 to 7) for mucosal carcinoma and 78% (14 to 18) for submucosal carcinoma, total 76% (19 to 25).
Case series	In the evaluation of lymph node metastasis, the overall accuracy was 56% by the ultrasound probe (sensitivity 25% and specificity 80%) and 67% by EUS (sensitivity 50% and specificity 80%).
Case series	Conclusions: The ultrasound probe was more convenient to use and more accurate than EUS in the evaluation of the depth of invasion of superficial esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Preoperative staging of superficial esophageal carcinoma: comparison of an ultrasound probe and standard endoscopic ultrasonography
Case series	Background: In esophageal cancer it is important to distinguish between mucosal cancer and cancer invading the submucosa to determine the feasibility of endoscopic mucosal resection. Methods: Endoscopic ultrasonography using a small probe 2.
Case series	6 mm in diameter at 15 or 20 MHz frequency was employed to determine the depth of superficial esophageal cancer invasion in 54 patients. Group 1 consisted of 17 cases treated by endoscopic mucosal resection on the basis of ultrasonographic findings.
Case series	Group II included 37 patients treated by conventional surgery. The resected specimens were compared with ultrasonographic findings.
Case series	Results: The normal esophageal wall was depicted as having nine layers, the fourth hypoechoic layer (m4) on the high frequency image was confirmed to be the muscularis mucosa.
Case series	Based on the ultrasound findings, cancer limited to the lamina propria was accurately determined in 84%. In the endoscopic mucosal resection cases, 15 were mucosal cancer whereas 2 cases had microscopic invasion of the submucosa.
Case series	Conclusions: High-frequency ultrasound probes were sufficiently accurate for the determination of the depths of invasion of early esophageal cancer to guide the application of endoscopic resection of mucosal cancer.
Case series	Small ultrasonic probes for determination of the depth of superficial esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: EUS is often used for locoregional staging of early esophageal neoplasia.
Case series	However, its value compared with that of endoscopic examination and diagnostic endoscopic resection (ER) may be questioned because diagnostic ER allows histological assessment of submucosal invasion and other risk factors for lymph node metastasis, eg, poor differentiation/lymphovascular invasion.
Case series	Objective: To evaluate how often patients were excluded from endoscopic treatment of esophageal neoplasia based on EUS findings. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care institution.
Case series	Patients: Patients with early esophageal neoplasia. Interventions: EUS, diagnostic ER. Main outcome measurements: Number of patients excluded from endoscopic treatment based on EUS results.
Case series	Results: A total of 131 patients were included (98 men, 33 women; age 66 ± 13 years). In 105 of 131 patients (80%), EUS findings were unremarkable.
Case series	In 25 of 105 patients (24%), diagnostic ER showed submucosal invasion (n = 17), deep resection margins positive for cancer (n = 2, confirmed at surgery), or poor differentiation/lymphovascular invasion (n = 6).
Case series	In 26 of 131 patients (20%), EUS findings raised the suspicion of submucosal invasion and/or lymph node metastasis. In the 14 of 26 patients (54%) with abnormal EUS findings, endoscopy results were unremarkable.
Case series	Diagnostic ER showed submucosal invasion in 7 of 14 (50%) patients, whereas no lymph node metastasis risk factors were found in 7 of 14 patients (50%), who subsequently underwent curative endoscopic treatment.
Case series	In 12 of 26 patients (46%) with abnormal EUS, endoscopy also raised doubts on whether curative endoscopic treatment could be achieved. After diagnostic ER, no risk factors for lymph node metastasis were found in 3 of 12 patients (25%).
Case series	Limitation: Retrospective study. Conclusions: This study shows that EUS has virtually no clinical impact on the workup of early esophageal neoplasia and strengthens the role of diagnostic ER as a final diagnostic step.
Case series	Do we still need EUS in the workup of patients with early esophageal neoplasia? A retrospective analysis of 131 cases
Case series	Background: Endoscopic ultrasonography is a precise method for TN staging of esophageal cancer. We explored the staging properties of a linear miniprobe as compared with a radial-scanning echoendoscope.
Case series	Methods: Sixty-eight patients with esophageal cancer underwent preoperative TN staging using a 20-MHz linear miniprobe and a 7. 5/12-MHz radial-scanning echoendoscope. Tumor stage was verified by surgery and/or histology.
Case series	Results: T and N stages were verified in 53 and 54 patients, respectively. T-staging accuracy using the echoendoscope was 70%.
Case series	The high-frequency miniprobe could not differentiate between T3 and T4 tumors, but both systems had an accuracy of 87% in discriminating between T1, T2, and T3/4 stages.
Case series	With traversable tumors, the accuracy of N staging was significantly better with the echoendoscope than with the miniprobe (90% vs. 48%, P = 0. 008).
Case series	Conclusions: The two endosonographic systems had similar accuracy for assessing transmural tumor growth, but the echoendoscope was superior in staging advanced transmural tumors and in predicting lymph node metastasis with traversable tumors.
Case series	Comparison of a linear miniature ultrasound probe and a radial-scanning echoendoscope in TN staging of esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: High-frequency catheter ultrasound (C-EUS) probes provide high resolution images of the gastrointestinal tract. Their use in the esophagus is limited by the requirement for a water-filled lumen for good acoustical coupling.
Case series	We have developed a system using a condom that provides a continuous column of water for high resolution C-EUS imaging of the esophagus. Methods: Nine patients underwent condom C-EUS for evaluation of esophageal mucosal and submucosal tumors.
Case series	A standard latex condom was attached to a 2-channel endoscope and filled with water after esophageal intubation. A 20 MHz C-EUS probe placed within the water-filled condom was used to characterize all lesions.
Case series	Results: The condom C-EUS system provided a 360 degree, high resolution image throughout the length of the esophagus without air artifact and without the risk of aspiration associated with filling the esophageal lumen with water.
Case series	Complete imaging of the tumor was obtained in all cases, and no additional C-EUS procedures were required. The condom C-EUS was subjectively rated superior overall in comparison to standard C-EUS by 4 independent endosonographers.
Case series	Conclusions: Condom C-EUS is a new method of high resolution imaging of the esophagus. This method provides a contained column of water within the esophagus that improves image quality and ease of use and may reduce the risk of aspiration.
Case series	Imaging of esophageal tumors with a water-filled condom and a catheter US probe
Case series	Background: High-frequency catheter US probes provide greater accuracy compared with dedicated echoendoscopes in the staging of superficial esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	However, it may be difficult and time consuming to obtain acoustic coupling with these devices. The aim of this study was to test a novel catheter US technique for staging superficial esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Methods: Twelve patients underwent examination with a 2-channel endoscope. US images were obtained with a catheter US probe (20 MHz) fitted with a balloon sheath. Results: Adequate endoscopic and catheter US images were obtained in all patients.
Case series	Depth of tumor invasion as determined with the catheter US probe was confirmed in all 5 patients who underwent surgery. No procedure-related complications occurred.
Case series	Conclusions: US with a catheter US probe and sheath allows complete endoscopic examination and preoperative determination of depth of invasion of superficial esophageal carcinoma in a single endoscopic procedure.
Case series	Preliminary results suggest this technique is accurate and safe.
Case series	High-frequency US catheter-based staging of early esophageal tumors
Case series	The prognosis for patients with carcinoma of the esophagus remains poor despite aggressive combination therapies and radical surgical resections.
Case series	Accuracy of staging esophageal carcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography is unmatched by that of any other modality.
Case series	Of patients with esophageal carcinoma, 20% to 36% present with high-grade malignant strictures that preclude passage of the echoendoscope.
Case series	Aggressive wire-guided dilation followed by complete endoscopic ultrasonographic assessment or endosonography limited to the proximal aspect of the stricture has been used in staging these patients.
Case series	Of 204 patients with esophageal carcinoma, 51 (25%) presented with high-grade malignant strictures, defined as stenosis precluding passage of the echoendoscope without prior dilation.
Case series	Thirty-nine of the 51 patients were treated by esophageal resection. Twenty-one of these patients underwent preoperative staging using wire-guided dilation followed by endoscopic ultrasonography, whereas 18 underwent limited endosonographic staging.
Case series	Correct preoperative assessment of depth of tumor invasion (T stage) was obtained in 33% (7 of 21) of the former group and 28% (5 of 18) of the latter group.
Case series	Advanced tumor stage (stage III or IV) was present in 90% (35 of 39) of patients presenting with high-grade strictures, indicating a poor prognosis for those patients.
Case series	The current study demonstrates that (1) approximately 25% of all patients with esophageal carcinoma present with high-grade stricutres that preclude passage of the echoendoscope without prior dilation, (2) the majority of patients with high-grade malignant strictures present with advanced disease (stage III or IV), and (3) because of the low accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography in staging high-grade strictures, the need to subject such patients to invasive staging studies is questionable.
Case series	Malignant esophageal strictures: staging accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography
Case series	Background: To fully evaluate patients with esophageal cancer by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), the transducer must pass through the entire tumor to the cardia to scan the celiac axis. Dilation may be necessary.
Case series	Published information suggests that dilation with EUS carries a sizeable risk.
Case series	Methods: In order to assess the complication rate associated with dilation prior to EUS in patients with esophageal cancer and the clinical significance of dilation for complete EUS staging, we reviewed the records of all patients who had undergone EUS for esophageal cancer.
Case series	Results: Sixty-three patients underwent EUS staging of esophageal cancer. Thirty-nine (62%) had lesions through which the EUS scope was passable (Group I).
Case series	Ten (16%) patients (Group II) had lesions through which an EUS scope (diameter 13 mm) was unable to pass even after dilation. Fourteen patients (22%) had lesions that were dilated to allow passage of the EUS scope (Group III).
Case series	All patients in Groups II and III had confirmation of EUS staging by CT and/or surgery. In Group II, five patients had tumors defined as T4 (50%) and five as T3 (50%). In Group III, nine (64%) had T4 tumors, four (29%) had T3, and one (7. 7%) had T2.
Case series	No complications were encountered in any group. Conclusion: EUS, either alone or after dilation, is a safe procedure and the complete EUS examination with celiac node visualization adds prognostically significant information.
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasound for staging esophageal cancer, with or without dilation, is clinically important and safe
Case series	Background: Endosonography is very accurate for the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Approximately 20-38% of patients with esophageal carcinoma present with high-grade malignant strictures that preclude passage of the dedicated echoendoscope.
Case series	In patients with such strictures, endosonographic staging of esophageal tumors may be performed after aggressive esophageal dilatation.
Case series	However, aggressive dilatation and passage of the echoendoscope in patients with high-grade malignant strictures is not without risk.
Case series	A detailed assessment of the tumor stage in patients presenting with high-grade malignant stenoses has not been previously reported to the authors' knowledge.
Case series	Methods: Seventy-nine patients with esophageal carcinoma were staged preoperatively using endosonography.
Case series	The results of preoperative staging were compared with the pathologic stage of the esophagectomy specimen when available or the surgical stage (detection of adjacent organ involvement [Stage T4] or metastatic disease [Stage M1] at the time of surgery).
Case series	Results: Twenty-one patients (26. 6%) presented with high-grade malignant strictures precluding endosonographic examination without prior esophageal dilatation.
Case series	Nineteen of the 21 patients (91%) with high-grade malignant stricture had Stage III or IV disease by histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen.
Case series	Five of these 21 patients (24%) sustained an esophageal perforation as a result of either wire-guided dilatation, or as a direct consequence of the endosonographic staging procedure.
Case series	The discovery of metastatic lymph nodes proximal to the stricture resulted in successful staging (assessment of depth of tumor penetration and lymph node involvement) in only 2 of these 21 patients before esophageal dilatation (incomplete staging).
Case series	Staging of the proximal aspect of the tumor was obtained in the remaining 19 patients before dilatation; however, the accuracy for such incomplete staging was only 33%.
Case series	Conclusions: The majority of patients with esophageal carcinoma presenting with high-grade malignant strictures precluding endoscope passage without prior dilatation have a relatively advanced stage of disease (Stage III or IV) compared with those patients presenting with less severe stenoses.
Case series	There is a significant risk for esophageal perforation (24%) when patients with high-grade malignant esophageal strictures undergo preoperative staging using endosonography.
Case series	Patients with high-grade malignant strictures, therefore, present a relative contraindication to endosonography using the dedicated echoendoscope.
Case series	High-grade malignant stricture is predictive of esophageal tumor stage. Risks of endosonographic evaluation
Case series	Background: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration identifies patients with esophageal cancer who are unlikely to be cured by surgery.
Case series	In approximately 30% of patients the staging procedure cannot be completed without dilation of an obstructing tumor. Methods: All EUS examinations for esophageal cancer requiring dilation from July 1995 to December 1998 were included.
Case series	Yield was defined as newly diagnosed metastatic (celiac lymph nodes) or locally invasive disease that could not have been detected without dilation. Results: EUS was performed in 132 patients. Forty-two (32%) required 44 dilations.
Case series	No complications occurred.
Case series	Of the 42 patients with obstruction, 18 (43%) had celiac adenopathy of which 7 had malignant cells confirmed histologically, 3 had benign adenopathy, and 8 did not undergo fine-needle aspiration due to T4 stage disease (5) or intervening vessels (3).
Case series	Two patients were upstaged after successful dilation from T2 N1 Mx to T4 N1 Mx and from T3 Nx Mx to T3 N1 M1. Overall, dilation allowed detection of advanced disease in 8 of 42 (19%) patients. Dilation to 11 to 12.
Case series	8 mm was insufficient (36% success rate) to complete EUS compared with dilation to 14 to 16 mm (87%, p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Dilation of obstructing esophageal tumors allows identification of a large number of patients with advanced stage malignancy.
Case series	Dilation to 14 to 16 mm is sufficient for complete staging in almost all patients.
Case series	Dilation of malignant esophageal stenosis to allow EUS guided fine-needle aspiration: safety and effect on patient management
Case series	Background and study aims: Endosonographic staging of esophageal carcinoma may be limited by non-traversable tumor stenoses. Dilation of malignant esophageal strictures carries a significant risk of esophageal perforation.
Case series	We therefore evaluated the use of ultrasonic miniprobes in the staging of stenotic esophageal carcinoma compared with conventional endoscopic ultrasound.
Case series	Patients and methods: In a blinded, prospective study, which included histopathological evaluation, 53 consecutive patients (43 male, 10 female, mean age 61 years) with stenosing esophageal carcinomas were examined preoperatively.
Case series	Endosonography was done using the optical GF-UM3 echo endoscope. If tumor strictures were not traversable with this instrument, a blind esophagoprobe, the MH-908 was used for endosonography.
Case series	Miniprobe sonography (MPS) was done during esophagoscopy in all patients. The various imaging modalities were assessed in terms of complete tumor traversability and correct tumor staging. Every patient underwent surgical tumor resection.
Case series	Results: MPS of the esophagus and proximal parts of the stomach was possible in all 53 patients without prior dilation of tumor stenoses. Endosonography with the GF-UM3 instrument was precluded in 23 patients (43.
Case series	4%) while in 20 of the latter patients the MH 908 esophagoprobe could be passed through tumor stenoses. The overall accuracy rates for depth of tumor infiltration (T) staging were: 62% (31/50) for endosonography (GF-UM3 plus esophagoprobe) and 86.
Case series	8% (46/53) for MPS. The accuracy rates for T staging in tumors traversable both with the GF-UM3 echo endoscope and with miniprobes were 56. 7% (17/30) for GF-UM3 and 80% (24/30) for MPS.
Case series	The accuracy rates for T staging in tumors traversable only with the MH-908 esophagoprobe and with miniprobes were 70% (14/20) for the MH-908 and 95% (19/20) for MPS.
Case series	With regard to the presence or absence of peri-esophageal metastatic lymph nodes (N staging), the accuracy rates were 83% (25/30) for MPS and 70% (21/30) for the GF-UM3, and 80% (16/20) for MPS and 70% (14/20) for the MH-908.
Case series	Conclusion: Compared with conventional endosonography using 7.
Case series	5-MHz large diameter instruments, MPS enables: a) safe passage through high-grade malignant esophageal strictures, achieving b) higher accuracy rates for T staging, and c) similar rates for N staging.
Case series	The use of MPS can also represent an improvement in the comfort and safety of patients. Moreover, miniprobe sonography is highly cost-effective compared with conventional endosonography.
Case series	Thus, MPS appears to be a valuable addition to the armamentarium for staging esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma: miniprobe sonography versus conventional endoscopic ultrasound in a prospective histopathologically verified study
Case series	Objectives: A treatment strategy for patients with esophageal carcinoma invading adjacent structures found during esophagectomy (surgical T4; sT4) has not been established and the role of esophagectomy remains controversial.
Case series	The aims of this study were to assess the clinicopathological characteristics and to clarify the prognostic factors of patients who underwent esophagectomy for sT4 tumors.
Case series	Methods: A consecutive series of 76 patients who were found to have sT4 tumors was reviewed retrospectively. T4 tumors were divided into two groups according to the invaded structures.
Case series	Cox's multivariate proportional hazard model was used to identify prognostic factors. Results: Complete tumor clearance with combined resection was performed in 12 patients (16%). Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 40. 8%, 9. 2%, and 7.
Case series	9%, respectively. There was no significant relationship between survival and invaded structure type or residual tumor status. Postoperative therapy was selected as an independent prognostic factor.
Case series	Conclusions: The complete resection rate was low and the prognosis of patients with sT4 tumors was poor. Subclassification according to the invaded structures was not a prognostic factor in this study.
Case series	Postoperative therapy may improve survival in sT4 patients and should be considered irrespective of residual tumor status after esophagectomy.

review	Assessment of resectability of gastrointestinal cancers by endoscopic ultrasonography
Case series	Endosonographic features that are thought to characterize lymph node metastasis were evaluated in 100 patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Subjects underwent preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography to assess depth of tumor invasion (T stage) and lymph node metastasis (N stage).
Case series	Endosonographically imaged lymph nodes were evaluated according to the following parameters: size, shape, border demarcation, and central echo pattern. Sensitivity and specificity of endosonography in detecting lymph node metastasis were 89.
Case series	1% and 91. 7%, respectively, when stringent criteria were used.
Case series	When lymph nodes were imaged endosonographically, regardless of the specific features, the likelihood of N1 disease, was 86%, whereas when no lymph nodes were imaged, the chance of N0 disease was 79%.
Case series	Endosonographic features predictive of malignancy in increasing order of importance were echo-poor (hypoechoic) structure, sharply demarcated borders, rounded contour, and size greater than 10 mm.
Case series	Collectively, the EUS features produced an additive effect with respect to accuracy in the prediction of malignant lymph node involvement; malignancy could be predicted with 100% accuracy when all four features were present.
Case series	These results demonstrate that a careful and systematic approach to the endosonographic assessment of lymph node metastasis can improve staging accuracy.
Case series	Endosonographic features predictive of lymph node metastasis
Case series	Background: The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate echo features of lymph nodes during endoscopic ultrasound and assess the utility of these echo features and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in predicting malignant lymph node invasion.
Case series	Methods: Thirty-five lymph nodes in 25 patients with lung, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer were evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound examinations were performed with a radial scanning echoendoscope.
Case series	Confirmation of benign lymph nodes was obtained by surgical resection while malignant lymph nodes were confirmed by real-time endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with a linear array echoendoscope.
Case series	Results: Nineteen benign lymph nodes and 16 malignant lymph nodes in the mediastinum, celiac axis, and the peripancreatic area were included in the study.
Case series	The following echo features were compared between benign and malignant lymph nodes: size greater than 1 cm, hypoechoic, distinct margins, and round shape. No single feature independently predicted malignant invasion.
Case series	When all four of the above features were present in the same lymph node, the accuracy for predicting malignant invasion was 80%. However, all four features of malignant involvement were present in only 25% (4 of 16) of malignant lymph nodes.
Case series	Our study also suggests that the above echo features may be a less reliable predictor of malignant invasion in pulmonary malignancies when compared to gastrointestinal cancers.
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes in 22 patients revealed malignant lymph node invasion in 16 and benign cells in 6 patients.
Case series	Conclusion: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is an important adjunct for accurate lymph node assessment for malignancy.
Case series	A comparison of the accuracy of echo features during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration for diagnosis of malignant lymph node invasion
Case series	Background & aims: The nodal staging of esophageal cancer accounts for the absence or presence of metastatic lymph nodes (N0 or N1, respectively).
Case series	Surgical data suggest that patients have worse survival when esophagectomy specimens contain higher numbers of regional malignant lymph nodes.
Case series	It has been proposed that the staging system for esophageal cancer be modified to include the number of malignant lymph nodes.
Case series	The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the number of malignant-appearing regional lymph nodes detected on endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) on survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Methods: Historical case series involved patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent EUS staging at a single center between 1994 and 2004.
Case series	Endoscopy reports were reviewed to determine the number of malignant-appearing periesophageal lymph nodes seen on EUS examination. Subjects were categorized as having 0, 1-2, or >2 periesophageal lymph nodes.
Case series	A regional cancer registry prospectively obtained survival data. Results: Among 85 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, the Kaplan-Meier curves showed distinct survival advantages in those with fewer malignant-appearing regional lymph nodes (P=.
Case series	0008). The median survivals were 66 months, 14. 5 months, and 6. 5 months for 0, 1-2, and >2 malignant-appearing lymph nodes, respectively.
Case series	Survival was also influenced by celiac lymph nodes and tumor length, both of which were associated with increased number of malignant nodes.
Case series	Conclusions: The number of malignant-appearing periesophageal lymph nodes detected by EUS is associated with improved survival stratification in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and should be considered in the presurgical staging of esophageal cancer.
Case series	Influence of the number of malignant regional lymph nodes detected by endoscopic ultrasonography on survival stratification in esophageal adenocarcinoma
Case series	The key prognostic factor which predicts outcome after esophagectomy for cancer is the number of malignant lymph node metastases, but data regarding the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in determining and predicting the metastatic lymph node count preoperatively are limited.
Case series	The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of EUS defined lymph node metastasis count (eLNMC) in patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer.
Case series	Two hundred and sixty-seven consecutive patients (median age 63 years, 187 months) underwent specialist EUS followed by stage directed multidisciplinary treatment (183 esophagectomy [64 neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 19 neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy], 79 definitive chemoradiotherapy, and 5 palliative therapy).
Case series	The eLNMC was subdivided into four groups (0, 1, 2 to 4, >4) and the primary measure of outcome was survival. Survival was related to EUS tumor (T) stage (P < 0. 0001), EUS node (N) stage (P < 0. 0001), EUS tumor length (p < 0.
Case series	0001), and eLNMC (P < 0. 0001). Multivariable analysis revealed EUS tumor length (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 071, 95% CI 1. 008-1. 138, P= 0. 027) and eLNMC (HR 1. 302, 95% CI 1. 133-1. 496, P= 0.
Case series	0001) to be significantly and independently associated with survival.
Case series	Median and 2-year survival for patients with 0, 1, 2-4, and >4 lymph node metastases were: 44 months and 71%, 36 months and 59%, 24 months and 50%, and 17 months and 32%, respectively.
Case series	The total number of EUS defined lymph node metastases was an important and significant prognostic indicator.
Case series	Prognostic significance of the endoscopic ultrasound defined lymph node metastasis count in esophageal cancer
Case series	Objective: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical staging of depth of tumor invasion (cT), the relationship of cT to survival, the benefits of downstaging cT, and the role of cT in treatment decisions.
Case series	Methods: The accuracy of determining T by means of endoscopic ultrasonography and the relationship of cT to survival were assessed in 209 patients undergoing esophagectomy alone for esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The benefit of downstaging cT was assessed in 128 patients undergoing induction therapy and esophagectomy. The role of cT in treatment decisions was determined by integrating these results with the results of previous work.
Case series	Results: Compared with pathologic T (pT), cT was 87% accurate, 82% sensitive, 91% specific, 89% positively predictive, and 86% negatively predictive of tumors confined to (< or =T2) or invading beyond (>T2) the esophageal wall.
Case series	In cN0, increasing cT was predictive of progressively poorer survival. For each category of pT N0, cT accurately predicted survival, except for pT3, which was underestimated (P <. 0001).
Case series	In cN0, downstaging by induction therapy was beneficial only if tumors invaded beyond the wall (> or =cT3, P =. 0003). In cN1, it was beneficial only when downstaging was synchronous in cT3/T4 (P <. 001).
Case series	Conclusions: cT should be the principal determinant of treatment in cN0. In cN0, if endoscopic ultrasonography identifies tumors of greater than cT2, multimodality therapy should be considered.
Case series	However, only when cT3/T4 tumors are downstaged to pT2 or less will patients benefit, but their survival will not equal that of patients with tumors of cT2 or less having esophagectomy alone.
Case series	If endoscopic ultrasonography identifies tumors of cT2 or less, esophagectomy alone should be used because induction therapy might adversely affect survival.
Case series	Role of clinically determined depth of tumor invasion in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background & aims: Endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) permits cytological confirmation of EUS findings.
Case series	A multicenter prospective evaluation of EUS-FNA for primary diagnosis, staging, and/or follow-up purposes was undertaken. Methods: EUS-FNA was performed in 457 patients with 554 lesions.
Case series	Clinical (n = 218) or histopathologic (n = 256) confirmation was available in 192 lymph nodes, 145 extraluminal masses, 115 gastrointestinal wall lesions, and 22 cystic lesions.
Case series	Results: EUS-FNA sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 92%, 93%, and 92% for lymph nodes, 88%, 95%, and 90% for extraluminal masses, and 61%, 79%, and 67% for gastrointestinal wall lesions, respectively.
Case series	The sensitivity and accuracy for lymph nodes and extraluminal masses was superior to that for gastrointestinal wall lesions. When EUS-FNA was compared with EUS size criteria in lymph node evaluation, specificity (93% vs. 24%) and accuracy (92% vs.
Case series	69%) were superior, whereas sensitivity (92% vs. 86%) was similar. The accuracy of EUS-FNA in patients with previously failed biopsy procedures was 81% (73 of 90). Five nonfatal complications occurred for a rate of 0. 5% (95% confidence interval, 0.
Case series	1%-0. 8%) in solid lesions vs. 14% (95% confidence interval, 6%-21%) in cystic lesions. Conclusions: EUS-FNA accurately and safely evaluates solid peri-intestinal lesions and improves lymph node staging accuracy.
Case series	Endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy: diagnostic accuracy and complication assessment
Case series	Background and study aims: Diagnosis of submucosal lesions, pancreatic tumors, and mediastinal or celiac lymph nodes or masses is possible using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), but histological confirmation to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions is still required.
Case series	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new method of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of intramural and paramural lesions.
Case series	Patients and methods: From October 1991 to September 1994, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was carried out in 141 patients with findings of mediastinal masses (18 cases), mediastinal lymph nodes (24 cases), submucosal tumors (seven cases), celiac lymph nodes (26 cases), large gastric folds with negative endoscopic biopsy (13 cases), pancreatic tumors (43 cases), a small liver metastasis (five cases), retrorectal tumors (four cases), and an adrenal metastasis (one case).
Case series	The EUS examination was performed using a Pentax-Hitachi FG 32-UA system. Results: A malignant tumor was diagnosed in 110 of the 141 patients. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration was positive in 85 cases.
Case series	In 15 cases, an adequate specimen could not be obtained (10. 6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of malignancy were 77. 0% and 100%, respectively.
Case series	Results were better for mediastinal masses (sensitivity 88%), mediastinal lymph nodes (81%), and celiac lymph nodes (80%) than for pancreatic tumors (75%) or submucosal tumors (60%).
Case series	Conclusions: These results suggest that EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy using a curved-array transducer represents a step forward in the tissue diagnosis of gastrointestinal lesions.
Case series	Fine-needle aspiration cytology guided by endoscopic ultrasonography: results in 141 patients
Case series	Background: The aims of this study were to determine the utility of EUS and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the detection and confirmation of celiac lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer and to define EUS features predictive of celiac lymph node metastasis in these patients.
Case series	Methods: The records of 211 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent EUS staging were reviewed.
Case series	The operating characteristics of EUS were determined in patients where either surgery, EUS-FNA of a celiac lymph node, or both were performed (n = 102).
Case series	The association between selected variables and the presence of celiac lymph node metastasis was evaluated by univariate and multivariable analyses.
Case series	Results: EUS in 48 patients provided a true-positive diagnosis of celiac lymph node involvement, a false-positive and false-negative result, respectively, in 6 and 14 patients, and a true-negative diagnosis in 34 patients.
Case series	The sensitivity of EUS in detecting celiac lymph node was 77% (95% CI [67, 88]), specificity 85% (95% CI [74, 96]), negative predictive value 71% (95% CI [58, 84]), and the positive predictive value 89% (95% CI [81, 97]).
Case series	EUS-FNA was performed in 94% (51/54) of patients with celiac lymph nodes. The accuracy of EUS-FNA in detecting malignant celiac lymph nodes was 98% (95% CI [90, 100]).
Case series	Advanced T-stage, the need for dilation, detection of peritumoral lymph nodes, and black race were associated with celiac lymph node involvement. In multivariable analysis, advanced T-stage was the strongest predictor of celiac lymph node involvement.
Case series	Conclusion: EUS and EUS-FNA are highly accurate in detecting and confirming celiac lymph nodes metastasis. Depth of tumor invasion as assessed by EUS is a strong predictor of celiac lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer.
Case series	The utility of EUS and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration in detecting celiac lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer: a single-center experience
Case series	Background: Clinical staging of esophageal cancer is required for optimal therapy but remains imprecise. Pathologic verification of involved lymph nodes could potentially direct treatment allocation.
Case series	With the rising incidence of distal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas, assessment of the celiac axis lymph nodes (CLNs) becomes important because it is a common nodal drainage basin.
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) permits evaluation of CLNs and biopsy by fine-needle aspiration. This study examined the usefulness of this staging tool.
Case series	Methods: A consecutive series of 62 patients with esophageal cancer considered resectable by computed tomographic scan underwent EUS for T and N staging and were retrospectively studied.
Case series	A CLN visualized by EUS as greater than 5 mm was considered positive. Fine-needle aspiration of the CLN was performed routinely. Endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomographic staging were compared on the basis of pathologic verification of CLNs.
Case series	Results: It was possible to evaluate CLNs by EUS in 59 (95%) of 62 patients: positive in 19, negative in 40. In EUS-positive patients, fine-needle aspiration was positive in 15, falsely negative in 2, and not done in 2.
Case series	By computed tomographic scan, CLNs were negative in 57 patients and positive in 2. The CLNs were positive in 23 of 54 patients eligible for CLN pathologic verification.
Case series	All positive CLNs not identified by EUS (7 false-negative EUS) were microscopic foci in one or two nodes and were associated with T3 tumors.
Case series	Sensitivity and specificity of EUS were 72% and 97%, respectively, compared with 8% and 100% for computed tomographic scan. When EUS identified CLNs, fine-needle aspiration confirmed positivity in 88% of cases.
Case series	Conclusions: Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration is useful in the detection and confirmation of CLN metastasis. In T3 tumors of the distal esophagus, a negative EUS result does not substantiate absence of CLN disease.
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration may be important in guiding treatment for patients with distal adenocarcinoma and documenting disease before neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Esophageal cancer staging: improved accuracy by endoscopic ultrasound of celiac lymph nodes
Case series	Background and study aims: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biopsy in patients with esophageal carcinoma where distant lymph nodes which were possibly metastatic were visualized using EUS.
Case series	Patients and methods: Out of 198 patients (150 men, mean age 66 years) examined over a 4-year period by EUS for local staging of esophageal cancer (121 squamous cell carcinomas and 77 adenocarcinomas), there was EUS visualization of distant lymph nodes in 40 (20%).
Case series	EUS-guided biopsy was carried out in the latter patients, of cervical nodes with mediastinal tumors (n = 19), of celiac nodes with cervical tumors (n = 2) or superior mediastinal tumors (n = 9), and upper mediastinal lymph nodes in the case of distal adenocarcinomas (n = 10).
Case series	Results: On EUS-guided biopsy, results were positive in 31 patients, eight were correctly negative (as confirmed by surgery), and in one patient there was a technical failure, with positive findings on subsequent surgery.
Case series	The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of malignant lymph nodes were therefore 97% and 100% respectively. The positive results of EUS-guided biopsy modified the tumor staging in 31 of these cases (77.
Case series	5%), proving distant lymph node metastasis which is classified as stage M1. With regard to actual clinical management, surgery was withheld from 24 patients (60% of 40 cases) who were then treated with concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Case series	Conclusion: EUS-guided biopsy of distant lymph nodes was indicated in 20% of patients with esophageal cancers, and the biopsy results led to upgrading of the tumor stage in about 80% of cases and influenced the treatment decision in about 60%.
Case series	Distant lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer: impact of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy
Case series	Background: Preoperative identification of lymph node metastases associated with esophageal carcinoma may influence treatment. EUS is the most accurate method for locoregional staging of these tumors.
Case series	The impact of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) on lymph node staging in esophageal carcinoma is unclear. Methods: From May 1996 to May 1999, 74 patients with esophageal carcinoma underwent preoperative EUS.
Case series	After October 1998 EUS-guided FNA was performed on nonperitumoral lymph nodes greater than 5 mm in width. The results of EUS with and without FNA were retrospectively reviewed and compared.
Case series	Final diagnosis was based on surgical results or EUS-guided FNA malignant cytology. Ten of the 74 patients had to be excluded for lack of lymph node stage confirmation.
Case series	Final diagnosis was obtained in the remaining 64 patients (33 from the EUS only group and 31 from the EUS-FNA group). Results: The results of EUS versus EUS-FNA for lymph node staging were sensitivity 63% versus 93% (p = 0.
Case series	01), specificity 81% versus 100% (not significant), and accuracy 70% versus 93% (p = 0. 02), respectively.
Case series	Complications comprised 1 patient who developed self-limited bleeding after dilation that did not preclude completion of the EUS (1%, 95% CI [0%, 7%]).
Case series	Conclusions: EUS-FNA is more sensitive and accurate than EUS alone for preoperative staging of locoregional and celiac lymph nodes associated with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	EUS-FNA of nonperitumoral lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma is safe and should be routinely performed when treatment decisions will be affected by nodal stage.
Case series	Impact of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration on lymph node staging in patients with esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Endosonography (EUS) is the most accurate modality for assessing depth of tumor invasion and local lymph node metastasis. However, its accuracy in the identification of metastatic (celiac axis) lymph nodes is less well defined.
Case series	Our objective in this study was to determine the accuracy of Eus in detecting celiac axis lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal carcinoma. Methods: Two hundred fourteen patients with esophageal carcinoma underwent preoperative EUS.
Case series	Of these, 145 underwent attempted surgical resection and staging, and 4 underwent EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of mediastinal and celiac lymph nodes.
Case series	Local (mediastinal) and distant (celiac axis) lymph nodes were assessed for malignancy on the basis of four criteria (larger than 1 cm, round, homogeneous echo pattern, sharp borders).
Case series	Accuracy of EUS was determined by means of correlating histopathologic findings for the resected lymph nodes or results of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination.
Case series	Results: Surgical exploration (n = 145) and fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination (n = 4) revealed metastatic celiac axis lymph nodes in 23 and metastatic mediastinal (local) lymph nodes in 93 of 149 patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	According to defined criteria for malignant lymph nodes, there were 19 true-positive and 4 falsenegative results. Sensitivity for the diagnosis of celiac lymph node metastasis with EUS was 83% with a 98% specificity.
Case series	For the diagnosis of mediastinal lymph node metastasis, sensitivity was 79% and specificity was 63%. All patients with malignant celiac axis lymph nodes had local T3 (tumor breaching adventitia) or T4 (tumor invading adjacent organs) disease.
Case series	Conclusion: EUS is an excellent modality in the evaluation of metastatic celiac axis lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma. These findings should be used in selecting options for treatment.
Case series	Sensitivity for detecting malignancy is consistent with that of prior studies, and local and regional lymph nodes and specificity is significantly higher.
Case series	Evaluation of metastatic celiac axis lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma: accuracy of EUS
Case series	Background & aims: Therapy of esophageal carcinoma is stage dependent. The role of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS FNA) in this setting is unclear.
Case series	The aims of this study were to compare the performance characteristics of CT, EUS, and EUS FNA for preoperative nodal staging of esophageal carcinoma and to measure the impact of each staging test on treatment decisions.
Case series	Methods: From December 1999 to March 2001, all patients with esophageal carcinoma seen at the Mayo Clinic Rochester were prospectively evaluated with CT, EUS, and EUS FNA. The impact of tumor stage on final therapy was assessed.
Case series	Results: A total of 125 patients with esophageal carcinoma were enrolled. EUS FNA was more sensitive (83% vs. 29%; P < 0. 001) than CT and more accurate than CT (87% vs. 51%; P < 0. 001) or EUS (87% vs. 74%; P = 0. 012) for nodal staging.
Case series	Direct surgical resection was contraindicated in 77% of patients evaluated due to advanced locoregional/metastatic disease.
Case series	Tumor location, patient age, comorbidities, and tumor stage determined by CT, EUS, and EUS FNA were associated with treatment decisions (P < 0. 05).
Case series	EUS FNA resulting in a higher/worse stage than CT (41 patients) was associated with a greater rate of treatments that were not direct surgeries compared with cases in which the stage was the same or better.
Case series	Conclusions: EUS FNA is more accurate for nodal staging and impacts on therapy of patients with esophageal carcinoma. EUS FNA should be included in the preoperative staging algorithm of these patients.
Case series	Impact of lymph node staging on therapy of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) is the most accurate method for lymph-node staging of esophageal carcinoma; however, it may not be necessary when EUS features are present that strongly suggest a benign or a malignant origin.
Case series	Aims: (1) To identify a combination of EUS criteria that have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to preclude the need for EUS-FNA and (2) to assess the cost savings derived from a selective EUS-FNA approach.
Case series	Methods: A total of 144 patients with esophageal carcinoma were prospectively evaluated with EUS.
Case series	Accuracy of standard (hypoechoic, smooth border, round, or width > 5 mm) and modified (4 standard plus EUS identified celiac lymph nodes, >5 lymph nodes, or EUS T3/4 tumor) criteria were compared (receiver operating characteristic curves).
Case series	Resource utilization of two diagnostic strategies, routine (all patients with lymph nodes) and selective EUS-FNA (FNA only in those patients in whom the number of EUS malignant criteria provides a sensitivity and a specificity <100%), were compared.
Case series	Results: Modified EUS criteria for lymph-node staging were more accurate than standard criteria (area under the curve 0. 88 vs. 0. 78, respectively).
Case series	No criterion alone was predictive of malignancy; sensitivity and specificity reached 100% when a cutoff value of >1 and >6 modified criteria were used, respectively. The EUS-FNA selective approach may avoid performing FNA in 61 patients (42%).
Case series	Conclusions: Modified EUS lymph-node criteria are more accurate than standard criteria. A selective EUS-FNA approach reduced the cost by avoiding EUS-FNA in 42% of patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	These results require confirmation in future studies.
Case series	Routine vs. selective EUS-guided FNA approach for preoperative nodal staging of esophageal carcinoma
Cohort study	Background: It is well known that a learning curve exists for performing EUS. Objective: To determine whether the number of EUS investigations performed in a center affects the results of esophageal cancer staging.
Cohort study	Design: We compared EUS in the evaluation of T stage and the presence of regional and celiac lymph nodes in a low-volume center where <50 EUS/endoscopist/y were performed with reported results from 7 high-volume EUS centers.
Cohort study	Setting: A reference center for esophageal cancer (>90 cases/y) but a low-volume center for EUS when it comes to individual endoscopists.
Cohort study	Patients: From 1994 to 2003, 244 patients underwent EUS, without specific measures to pass a stenotic tumor or FNA and with postoperative TNM stage as the criterion standard in the low-volume EUS center.
Cohort study	In the high-volume centers, 670 EUS investigations for esophageal cancer were performed, if needed, with dilation, and with postoperative TNM stage and/or FNA as the criterion standard. Interventions: Retrospective analysis.
Cohort study	Main outcome measurements: Sensitivity and specificity of EUS for esophageal cancer staging.
Cohort study	Results: In the low-volume center, results of EUS for T3 staging in patients in whom passage of the EUS probe was possible were almost comparable for sensitivity (85% vs 88%-94%) but were lower for specificity (57% vs 75%-90%), whereas both sensitivity (58% vs 75%-90%) and specificity (87% vs 94%-97%) for T1 or T2 stages were lower than those reported in the high-volume centers.
Cohort study	In the low-volume center, sensitivities of EUS for regional (45% vs 63%-89%) and celiac (19% vs 72%-83%) lymph nodes were lower, whereas specificities (75% vs 63%-82% and 99% vs 85%-100%, respectively) were comparable with those from high-volume centers.
Cohort study	Results in the low-volume EUS center were worse if the EUS probe could not pass the stricture, which occurred in almost 30% of patients. Limitations: Both FNA and dilation before EUS for stenotic tumors were not performed in the low-volume EUS center.
Cohort study	Conclusions: The results of EUS performed in a low-volume EUS center compared unfavorably with those reported from high-volume EUS centers.
Cohort study	The results of this study suggest that preoperative staging by EUS should be performed by experienced and dedicated EUS endoscopists to optimize staging of esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Staging of esophageal carcinoma in a low-volume EUS center compared with reported results from high-volume centers
Case series	To investigate interobserver variation and reproducibility of endosonographic findings, both experienced and inexperienced endosonographers evaluated depth of tumor invasion (T stage) and presence of lymph node metastasis (N stage) in 50 patients with nonobstructing esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Results were compared with the findings by surgical pathology of the resected specimens.
Case series	The kappa statistic (kappa) was used to assess interobserver and intraobserver agreement and consistency of accurate interpretation (reproducibility) for the two groups. Agreement between the experienced endosonographers was excellent (kappa = >.
Case series	75) for T1 and T4 lesions, good (kappa =. 61) for T3 lesions, but only poor (kappa = >. 46) for T2 lesions. The overall agreement between the experienced endosonographers was equally good for both T and N stages.
Case series	Agreement between the inexperienced endosonographers was poor for all T stages but was good for lymph node metastasis (kappa =. 52).
Case series	For experienced endosonographers, endosonographic reproducibility of histologically confirmed T4 lesions was excellent, followed closely by T3 and T2 lesions; T1 tumors were frequently interpreted differently by the same endosonographer.
Case series	Reproducibility of N stage determinations was excellent for N0 lymph nodes and good for N1 nodes.
Case series	Thus, for experienced endosonographers, interobserver agreement was excellent for all T stages except T2, whereas reproducibility of determination of depth of tumor invasion was good to excellent for T2, T3, and T4 lesions but poor for T1 lesions.
Case series	As yet poorly defined operator and machine-dependent factors that cause misinterpretation of T1 and T2 tumors will require additional study.
Case series	Observer variation and reproducibility of endoscopic ultrasonography
Case series	Objectives: Learning endosonography (EES) is known to be difficult, and the theory must be understood before performing EES routinely.
Case series	The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic indexes of EES in the staging of cardio-oesophageal cancer after a period of theoretical apprenticeship of EES and a learning period in a centre experienced in EES since 1989.
Case series	Methods: Five observers, having never used EES, followed to EES examinations for a 3-6 month period. They then reviewed the standardized records of 29 patients with cardio-oesophageal cancer.
Case series	They had to evaluate the degree of tumour infiltration within oesophageal wall and the site of metastatic lymph nodes. Results were compared with the diagnosis of 5 experienced senior endoscopists.
Case series	Interobserver agreement was estimated with kappa statistics and considered excellent for k > or = 0. 75, good to moderate if 0. 75 > k > or = 0. 40, and poor if k < 0. 40.
Case series	Results: Inter-observer agreement was poor for the topographic diagnosis of lymph nodes (kappa index from -0. 09 to 0. 33), lower to that of the 5 senior observers (0. 33 to 0. 77). It was satisfactory for degree of tumour infiltration (T1: k = 0.
Case series	66; T2: k = 0. 58; T3: k = 0. 56; T4: k = 0. 46). The individual sensitivities were weak according to lymph nodes site, but good for presence of lymph nodes (86 to 100%), with a specificity of 40 to 73%.
Case series	Conclusions: After theoretical training of EES, agreement and diagnostic performances are good enough to diagnose pathological images (except for T4 tumors), and poor for localizing images in the mediastinum.
Case series	This emphasizes the difficulties in learning echo-anatomy and gives useful guidelines for training programs in EES.
Case series	[Evaluation of the teaching of echo-endoscopy. Application to the assessment of invasiveness of cancer of the esophagus and the cardia]
review	Interobserver agreement in cardioesophageal and rectal tumor evaluation is generally good, especially for uT1 and uT4 tumors. Diagnosis of a uT2 tumor is difficult and results in poor agreement.
review	However, the proportion of agreement is satisfactory for distinguishing tumors that invade the mediastinal or the perirectal fat from those that do not, a situation that may be the most relevant from a therapeutic point of view.
review	In cases of cardioesophageal tumor, agreement for metastatic LN is lower and depends on the sites involved, with the best agreement for intra-abdominal LN, which may indicate a worse prognosis.
review	Lack of agreement in EUS images can be avoided by precise manipulation of the echoendoscope in the upper part of the mediastinum and by improving training and the definitions regarding EUS.
review	Interobserver variation in tumor staging
Case series	Background: It has been suggested that 50 endosonographic examination are necessary to attain sufficient skill to become accurate in the staging of esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Methods: Since July 1991 all esophageal endosonographies have been performed by one investigator.
Case series	The database, containing all examinations since July 1991, was reviewed to investigate the presence of a learning curve in T-staging of esophageal carcinoma by comparing the endosonographic T-stage with the pathologic T-stage.
Case series	Results: From July 1991 until April 1993, 231 endosonographies were performed for esophageal malignancies. Eighty-nine patients had been referred for preoperative staging and underwent surgical exploration. Seventy-one tumors were resected.
Case series	The patients were split in two groups. Group I consisted of 36 patients examined between July 1991 and April 1992. In this period 100 endosonographies were performed. Group II consisted of 35 patients examined between April 1992 and March 1993.
Case series	In this period 131 endosonographies were performed. Overall endosonographic T-staging was correct in 70%. The accuracy in group I was 58%; In group II 83% (p < 0. 05). Overstaging was equally common in groups I and II (14%).
Case series	Understaging was common in group I (28%), but rare in group II (3%). Conclusion: This study shows a definite learning curve for endosonographic T-staging of esophageal carcinoma. Acceptable accuracy rates could only be achieved after 100 examinations.
Case series	Endosonographic T-staging of esophageal carcinoma: a learning curve
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a relatively new diagnostic method to assess the extent and the depth of infiltration of esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Since October 1990, EUS was performed in 55 patients presenting with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, 40 of whom were operated on. The first 23 patients underwent EUS with an Olympus GF-2/EU-M2 echoendoscope with a 7.
Case series	5-MHz transducer; the last 32 patients underwent EUS with an Olympus GF-3/EU-M3 instrument with a 7. 5-12-MHz echoprobe. In 22 patients, the procedure was not completed because of the impossibility of passing through the neoplastic stenosis.
Case series	The depth of infiltration (T parameter) was correctly defined by EUS in 36 of 40 patients (90%) compared with 50% of computed tomography (CT). The 12-MHz echoprobe yielded a global accuracy in staging T parameter of 94% compared to 82% of 7.
Case series	5-MHz transducer. The lymph-node involvement (N parameter) was correctly classified by EUS in 20 of 23 patients (87%) compared with 39% by CT.
Case series	EUS provides a high degree of accuracy in assessing the T and the N parameter in the staging of squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma. The major problem of the instrument is still the frequent impossibility of passing through the neoplastic stenosis.
Case series	Endoscopic ultrasonography for preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: The preoperative diagnosis of tumors of the esophagus and the gastric cardia is an important element in their stage-oriented therapy.
Case series	The goal of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of endosonographic ultrasound (EUS) and to test its usefulness in tumor staging and the assessment of operability.
Case series	Methods: A total of 139 tumors were scanned via EUS by one examiner </=14 days prior to resection (TNM staging per UICC, 1987). Results: The accuracy for completely traversable tumors was 60. 8% for T1, 82. 1% for T2, 77.
Case series	5% for T3, and 33% for T4 stages. This accuracy was somewhat reduced in cases of nontraversable tumor stenosis (51. 9%). In T staging, a significant case-dependent improvement in accuracy to 89. 5% was found; this was regarded as a learning effect.
Case series	In N staging, we considered only those tumors that were resected by the transthoracic approach with systematic node dissection and complete EUS (n = 80). N-stage accuracy (T1-T4) was 71. 3%, and no improvement could be shown.
Case series	To assess operability, discrimination between T1/T2 and T3/T4 tumors is crucial. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specifity can thus be improved significantly. Conclusions: The quality of EUS depends on the experience of the examiner.
Case series	Reliable results can be obtained after >75 examinations have been done. EUS is a valuable tool in tumor staging when it is performed by an experienced examiner or under the direct supervision of such a person.
Case series	The examiner's learning effect and its influence on the quality of endoscopic ultrasonography in carcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia
review	Endosonography is helpful in managing patients with esophageal cancer due to its capacity to stage the tumor for the depth of tumoral invasion and the presence of metastatic lymph nodes.
review	Thus, ES will help the surgeon to determine if surgery is advisable. If the patient does not undergo surgery, it will provide a very accurate prognosis and allow the adaptation of non-surgical multimodal therapy to determine tumor extension.
review	Finally, following the initial phase of treatment. ES will be useful in the follow-up, especially to detect and stage recurrences.
review	Endosonography-guided treatment of esophageal carcinoma
meta analysis	This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the staging of esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
meta analysis	Articles were searched in Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, Google scholar, and EMBASE. Two reviewers independently searched and extracted data.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis of the accuracy of EUS was analyzed by calculating pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR).
meta analysis	Pooling was conducted using either fixed-effects model or random-effects model depending on the heterogeneity across studies. Sixteen studies (n = 724) were included in this analysis.
meta analysis	The pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS to diagnose T1 stage tumor was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16-32%) and 95% (95%CI 93-97%), respectively.
meta analysis	For T2 stage, EUS had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 29% (95%CI 19-41%) and 84% (95%CI 77-88%). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS were 81% (95%CI 72-88%) and 42% (95%CI 33-52%) in determining T3 stage tumor.
meta analysis	To diagnose T4 stage tumor, EUS had a pooled sensitivity of 43% (95%CI 31-56%) and specificity of 96% (95%CI 94-97%), respectively. In determining N stage, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS were 69% (95%CI 58-79%) and 52% (95%CI 42-62%).
meta analysis	EUS is a moderately accurate technique in staging esophageal cancer after NAC. Its sensitivity is relatively high in T3 while specificity is high in other T stages (T1, T2, and T4).
meta analysis	Tumors restaged by EUS as T4 should not be assigned to surgery because it is very likely to be inoperable. EUS is not reliable for N staging with its poor sensitivity and specificity.
meta analysis	Subgroup analysis shows that staging accuracy did not improve with time.
meta analysis	Staging accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound for esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a meta-analysis and systematic review
Case series	Background: The usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma is well established. Alternatively, the role of EUS in the early diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence is less well accepted.
Case series	Methods: EUS was used to evaluate 30 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic patients (i. e. , with dysphagia) who had previously undergone resection of esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Results: There were 3 (10%) unsuspected anastomotic recurrences in the asymptomatic group. EUS correctly identified locally recurrent cancer in all cases, whereas endoscopy confirmed the presence of only one anastomotic recurrence.
Case series	Computed tomography was not diagnostic in any of the three recurrences.
Case series	Sensitivity of EUS for recurrence of esophageal carcinoma was 100% compared with 33% for endoscopic diagnosis while the specificity was 96% for EUS compared with 100% for endoscopic biopsy.
Case series	There was one false positive diagnosis of recurrence by EUS because of postoperative fibrosis resulting in concentric hypertrophy of the esophageal wall near the surgical anastomosis.
Case series	Of the 10 symptomatic patients, 4 were diagnosed with tumor recurrence. EUS correctly predicted recurrences in all symptomatic patients (100% sensitivity and specificity), as did upper endoscopy with biopsy.
Case series	Conclusions: EUS is more sensitive than upper endoscopy and CT scan for the evaluation of anastomotic recurrence of esophageal carcinoma and should be considered as an adjunctive modality to conventional endoscopy for the postoperative surveillance of these patients.
Case series	Postoperative screening for anastomotic recurrence of esophageal carcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography
Case series	Background: Half of the patients who undergo surgery for cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia present with recurrent disease within 2 years after the operation.
Case series	We investigated the value of endosonography for the early detection of recurrent disease. Methods: Forty-three patients entered a follow-up protocol in which endosonography was performed every 6 months within the first 2 years after resection.
Case series	Results: During 16 of a total of 66 examinations, suspicious abnormalities were found. In three patients free fluid was seen, but recurrence could not be confirmed during follow-up.
Case series	In eight patients suspicious lymph nodes were seen; six died within 6 months, one was alive with a proven recurrence at 6 months, and one was alive without recurrence at 22 months.
Case series	In five patients focal wall-thickening or a mass was seen; three died within 6 months, and two were alive with a proven recurrence at 2 and 5 months.
Case series	After exclusion of free fluid, the positive predictive value of abnormalities on endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was 92%.
Case series	Conclusions: Endosonography, performed at 6-month intervals after resection of cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia, is accurate in the early detection of locoregional recurrent disease.
Case series	Two thirds of the patients were still without symptoms when the recurrence was found.
Case series	Prospective study on the value of endosonographic follow-up after surgery for esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Endoscopic ultrasound is considered one of the best tools for the preoperative staging of esophageal, gastric, and rectal carcinoma.
Case series	Depending on the individual investigator, the sensitivity of preoperative tumor staging by endosonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GEUS) is 80-92% for gastric carcinoma and 86-95% for esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	However, the sensitivity and specificity of endosonography for the staging of lymph node metastases is less accurate.
Case series	The accuracy of rectal endosonography (REUS) is approximately 90% for tumor assessment and approximately 80% for the detection of lymph node metastases.
Case series	In this study, we address the question of whether endosonography enables the surgeon to distinguish scar tissue, which is rather homogeneous and echo-rich, from changes such as an anastomositis or a locoregional tumor recurrence, which are typically non-inhomogeneous and echo-poor.
Case series	Methods: During a 24-months period, we studied patients enrolled in a special tumor follow-up care program by either upper gastrointestinal (GEUS, n = 37 patients) or rectal endosonography (REUS, n = 49 patients) for exclusion of a locoregional tumor recurrence.
Case series	In each patient, local tumor recurrence was suspected because of either medical history, clinical examination, or other diagnostic procedures.
Case series	Results: As in previous studies, our retrospective analysis revealed that endosonography has a high sensitivity in the detection of local tumor recurrences (>90%) for both GEUS and REUS.
Case series	Conclusion: Endosonography is a highly accurate means of detecting local tumor recurrence.

Cross-sectional study	Background: A steep increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been observed between 1973 and 2001, but recent trends have not been reported. Our aim was to examine recent trends in esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute to identify all patients who were diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma between 1973 and 2006.
Cross-sectional study	Incidence trends were analyzed for esophageal adenocarcinoma overall and by stage using joinpoint regression. Results: Overall esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence increased from 3. 6 per million in 1973 to 25. 6 per million in 2006.
Cross-sectional study	Incidence trend analysis, however, suggests that the increase has slowed, from an 8. 2% annual increase prior to 1996 to 1. 3% increase in subsequent years (P = 0. 03).
Cross-sectional study	Stage-specific trend analyses suggest that the change in overall esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence largely reflects a plateau in the incidence of early stage disease. Its slope has changed direction, from a 10% annual increase prior to 1999 to a 1.
Cross-sectional study	6% decline in subsequent years (P = 0. 01). Conclusions: The incidence of early stage esophageal adenocarcinoma seems to have plateaued.
Cross-sectional study	Impact: Although definitive conclusions will require additional years of data, the plateau in early stage disease might portend stabilization in the overall incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Cross-sectional study	Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence: are we reaching the peak?
review	Gastroesophageal (GE) junction carcinoma is a rare but often lethal condition with increasing importance as a public health problem in recent decades.
review	Whereas diagnosis of this disease has been complicated historically by the lack of uniform classification standards, available data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry program in the United States show an approximate 2.
review	5-fold increase in the incidence of GE junction adenocarcinoma from 1973 to 1992, with rates stabilizing in the past 2 decades.
review	Similar proportional trends are observed among subgroups defined by race and gender, but rates are significantly higher in males relative to females, and in white males relative to black males.
review	Smoking, obesity, and GE reflux disease are significant risk factors for GE junction adenocarcinoma, and may account for a substantial fraction of total disease burden.
review	Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been associated with reduced incidence, and high dietary fiber intake has also been linked to lower disease risk.
review	Ongoing studies continue to explore a potential role for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chemoprevention.
review	Epidemiology and risk factors for gastroesophageal junction tumors: understanding the rising incidence of this disease
review	Esophageal cancer is a serious malignancy with regards to mortality and prognosis. It is a growing health concern that is expected to increase in incidence over the next 10 years.
review	Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological type of esophageal cancer worldwide, with a higher incidence in developing nations.
review	With the increased prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity in developed nations, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has dramatically increased in the past 40 years.
review	Esophageal cancer is staged according to the widely accepted TNM system. Staging plays an integral part in guiding stage specific treatment protocols and has a great impact on overall survival.
review	Common imaging modalities used in staging include computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound and positron emission tomography scans.
review	Current treatment options include multimodality therapy mainstays of current treatment include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
review	Tumor markers of esophageal cancer are an advancing area of research that could potentially lead to earlier diagnosis as well as playing a part in assessing tumor response to therapy.
review	Esophageal cancer: A Review of epidemiology, pathogenesis, staging workup and treatment modalities
Cross-sectional study	Background: The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer are high, with 5. 90 new cases and 5. 48 deaths per 100 000 people worldwide in 2017. The prognosis of esophageal cancer is poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 20%.
Cross-sectional study	Esophageal cancer in different geographical locations has different etiologies, and the incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer continue to rise in some regions.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: We collected incidence and mortality data by age and gender for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017 in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database.
Cross-sectional study	And we used these data to calculate the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) to quantify trends in morbidity and mortality.
Cross-sectional study	Then we analyzed the gender- and age-specific incidence and mortality in esophageal cancer to targeted high-risk populations.
Cross-sectional study	Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and both the EAPC and social-demographic index (SDI), and we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient.
Cross-sectional study	Results: We found that Malawi, East Asia, and high-middle SDI regions had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and ASMR, and the ASIR and ASMR in western Sub-Saharan Africa showed an upward trend.
Cross-sectional study	Our study also showed that the incidence and mortality in esophageal cancer were highest in men and in the 70+ years age group, and they presented a decreasing trend in most regions, but the 15-49 years age groups in Australasia, Caribbean, and Oceania and the 70+ years age group in High-Income North America, Oceania and high-SDI regions presented an increasing trend.
Cross-sectional study	There were significant negative associations between ASMR at baseline and EAPC and between ASMR and SDI in 2017.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusion: By analyzing the global distribution of incidence and mortality in esophageal cancer, trends over time, and gender and age specificity, we can understand the heterogeneity of its global trends.
Cross-sectional study	This heterogeneity can help us to identify high-risk groupsand to provide clues for the exploration of the etiology and early prevention of the disease.
Cross-sectional study	Global trends in the incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer from 1990 to 2017
Cross-sectional study	Esophageal cancer (EC) accounts for a considerable proportion of carcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the population of the Caspian littoral. The global histologic pattern of the disease has changed recently.
Cross-sectional study	The intent of this study was to determine the incidence of EC over the past decade in Eastern Azerbaijan--a north-western province of Iran--on the western side of the Caspian littoral and to assess the alteration of the histological pattern of the disease.
Cross-sectional study	In a retrospective study, all 1792 documented EC cases of all registered cancer, surgery, pathology, and radiotherapy centers of the province over a period of 9 years (from March 1994 to March 2003) were enrolled in the study.
Cross-sectional study	Data concerning demographic characteristics, EC risk factors, and histological findings were recorded. The incidence and the relative incidence of the pathological subtypes of EC in the population of the province were determined.
Cross-sectional study	The change in incidence rates and the interaction between main risk factors and tumor histology of the patients were assessed over the study years. The average incidence of EC in the over 30-year-old population of the province was 16. 2 (12.
Cross-sectional study	7 for squamous cell carcinoma [SCC] and 1. 9 for adenocarcinoma [AC]) cases per 100 000 person-years. Incidence of SCC, as well as AC, peaked at ages older than 65.
Cross-sectional study	Compared to women, men had higher incidences of AC and lower incidences of SCC; the average incidence rate of EC was equal in men and women. AC and SCC accounted for 12. 8% and 86. 9% of cases, respectively.
Cross-sectional study	Upper, middle and lower thirds of the esophagus were the location of tumors in 9. 8%, 32. 9% and 57. 3% of cases, respectively. During the study period, incidence rates of EC and SCC tended to decrease.
Cross-sectional study	The incidence rate of EC from 1995 to 1998 was almost 30% higher than that of the period from 1999 to 2002.
Cross-sectional study	Incidence rate of EC on the western side of the Caspian littoral is moderately high, but much lower than that of the eastern Caspian littoral as it was three decades ago.
Cross-sectional study	The incidence of EC was lower in the second half than the first half of the study period.
Cross-sectional study	Unlike the global pattern of EC, the incidence of EC as well as SCC in women is as high as or higher than in men, which is identical to the pattern in the eastern Caspian littoral.

Cohort study	Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates in Linxian, China are among the highest in the world.
Cohort study	We examined risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia cancer (GCC), and gastric noncardia cancer (GNCC) in a population-based, prospective study of 29,584 adults who participated in the Linxian General Population Trial.
Cohort study	All study participants completed a baseline questionnaire that included questions on demographic characteristics, personal and family history of disease, and lifestyle factors.
Cohort study	After 15 years of follow-up, a total of 3,410 incident upper gastrointestinal cancers were identified, including 1,958 ESCC, 1,089 GCC and 363 GNCC. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate risks.
Cohort study	Increased age and a positive family history of esophageal cancer (including ESCC or GCC) were significantly associated with risk at all 3 cancer sites.
Cohort study	Additional risk factors for ESCC included being born in Linxian, increased height, cigarette smoking and pipe smoking; for GCC, male gender, consumption of moldy breads and pipe smoking; and for GNCC, male gender and cigarette smoking.
Cohort study	Protective factors for ESCC included formal education, water piped into the home, increased consumption of meat, eggs and fresh fruits and increased BMI; for GCC, formal education, water piped into the home, increased consumption of eggs and fresh fruits and alcohol consumption; and for GNCC, increased weight and BMI.
Cohort study	General socioeconomic status (SES) is a common denominator in many of these factors and improving SES is a promising approach for reducing the tremendous burden of upper gastrointestinal cancers in Linxian.
Cohort study	Prospective study of risk factors for esophageal and gastric cancers in the Linxian general population trial cohort in China
Case-control study	Background: Several risk factors have been identified for esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, but no study has comprehensively examined their contributions to the cancer burden in the general population.
Case-control study	Herein, we estimate the population attributable risks (PARs) for various risk factors observed in a multicenter population-based case-control study.
Case-control study	Methods: We calculated PARs by using 293 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 261 with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, 221 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 368 with noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and 695 control subjects.
Case-control study	We included smoking for all four tumor types and Helicobacter pylori infection for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma as established causal risk factors as well as several other factors for which causality is under evaluation.
Case-control study	Results: Ever smoking, body mass index above the lowest quartile, history of gastroesophageal reflux, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 39. 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25. 6% to 55. 8%), 41. 1% (95% CI = 23. 8% to 60.
Case-control study	9%), 29. 7% (95% CI = 19. 5% to 42. 3%), and 15. 3% (95% CI = 5. 8% to 34. 6%) of esophageal adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 78. 7% (95% CI = 66. 5% to 87. 3%).
Case-control study	Ever smoking and body mass index above the lowest quartile were responsible for 45. 2% (95% CI = 31. 3% to 59. 9%) and 19. 2% (95% CI = 4. 9% to 52. 0%) of gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 56. 2% (95% CI = 38.
Case-control study	1% to 72. 8%). Ever smoking, alcohol consumption, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 56. 9% (95% CI = 36. 6% to 75. 1%), 72. 4% (95% CI = 53. 3% to 85. 8%), and 28. 7% (95% CI = 11. 1% to 56.
Case-control study	5%) of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 89. 4% (95% CI = 79. 1% to 95. 0%). Ever smoking, history of gastric ulcers, nitrite intake above the lowest quartile, and H. pylori infection were responsible for 18.
Case-control study	3% (95% CI = 6. 5% to 41. 8%), 9. 7% (95% CI = 5. 4% to 16. 8%), 40. 7% (95% CI = 23. 4% to 60. 7%), and 10. 4% (95% CI = 0. 3% to 79. 6%) of noncardia gastric adenocarcinomas, respectively, with a combined PAR of 59. 0% (95% CI = 16. 2% to 91. 4%).
Case-control study	Conclusion: In this population, a few known risk factors account for a majority of esophageal and gastric cancers.
Case-control study	These results suggest that the incidence of these cancers may be decreased by reducing the prevalence of smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, and being overweight and by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Case-control study	Population attributable risks of esophageal and gastric cancers
review	Since the early 1970s, the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically in most Western populations. In contrast, the incidence of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma has decreased in these same populations.
review	Epidemiological studies conducted over the past decade have provided great insights into the etiology of oesophageal cancer.
review	These studies have identified gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, obesity and cigarette smoking as risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma, while use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and infection with Helicobacter pylori are associated with reduced risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
review	For oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, alcohol and cigarette smoking are the two major risk factors underlying most cases.
review	This review combines a synthesis of these studies with an analysis of data from the United States National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to discuss the change in incidence of oesophageal cancer and summarize current knowledge of risk factors.
review	The epidemic of oesophageal carcinoma: Where are we now?
Cross-sectional study	Epidemiologic data on esophageal cancer in Asia are extremely limited. We examined temporal trends in the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) in Taiwan.
Cross-sectional study	Patients with esophageal cancer were identified from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 1979 and 2003. Age-standardized incidences of ESCC and EA were calculated based on the national census and world standard population.
Cross-sectional study	Trends in incidence rates were estimated by calculating the annual percentage change (APC). The age-standardized incidence of ESCC increased progressively (from 1979-1983 to 1999-2003: 2. 63 to 4. 37 per 100,000-year), with an APC higher in male (3.
Cross-sectional study	27%, P < 0. 0001) than that in female (1. 23%, P = 0. 03). Though the crude incidence of EA progressively increased in both gender (male: 0. 28-0. 49 per 100,000-year; female 0. 07-0.
Cross-sectional study	11 per 100,000-year), the age-standardized incidence of EA is similar along the study period with an APC of 0. 72% (P = 0. 20) in male and 1. 59% (P = 0. 30) in female.
Cross-sectional study	In Taiwan, the incidence of ESCC significantly increased from 1979 to 2003, whereas the incidence of EA remained unchanged. Although EA incidence has not recently increased, it could in the future.
Cross-sectional study	Increasing trend of the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but not adenocarcinoma, in Taiwan
Cross-sectional study	Background: The high incidence of oesophageal cancer in northern China is attributed predominantly to environmental factors. The role of genetic factors has not been extensively studied.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Our aim was to study familial aggregation of oesophageal cancer in pedigrees from a defined population base in a high incidence area in China and to quantify the risk associated with different first degree relatives using different analytical approaches.
Cross-sectional study	Detailed data on family members of three successive generations and the occurrence of oesophageal and other cancers in family members were collected from a population-based series of 244 oesophageal cancer cases which occurred between 1987 and mid-1992 in Huixian County, Henan.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Compared to expected rates, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of oesophageal cancer among first degree relatives of oesophageal cancer patients was 2. 4 (2. 2 in male and 2. 7 in female relatives).
Cross-sectional study	The corresponding SMR for first and second degree relatives were 1. 6 and 2. 2.
Cross-sectional study	The null hypothesis of 'no familial aggregation' was rejected using Tarone's one-sided score test for binomial distributions indicating some evidence for clustering within families.
Cross-sectional study	To account for variance due to between-pairs correlation and family and/or individual specific variables, we fitted a series of regression models using a Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) approach. The pairwise odds ratios were 2.
Cross-sectional study	3 for parent-parent, 1. 9 for sib-parent and 1. 1 for sib-sib, adjusted for sex, age and sex of index case.
Cross-sectional study	Discussion: The existence of familial aggregation of oesophageal cancer in the study population was confirmed using different analyses and a two- to threefold increased risk was found for first degree relatives.
Cross-sectional study	The clear association of disease between parent and sib provides some indication of a genetic component. The pairwise association between parents but not between sibs suggests that environmental factors have a stronger action after childhood.
Cross-sectional study	Familial aggregation of oesophageal cancer in a high incidence area in China
Case-control study	A case-control study involving interviews with 1,244 patients (758 males and 486 females) with cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia and 1,314 population-based controls (789 males, 525 females) was carried out in Linxian, a rural county in North Central China with one of the world's highest mortality rates for these tumors.
Case-control study	Cancer risks tended to rise with increasing intake of wheat and corn, but no association was found with adult intake of pickled vegetables, the leading a priori suspect, and risks were not elevated among those consuming low quantities of fresh vegetables or fruits.
Case-control study	Few differences in preparation or storage of food or water were detected, although cancer patients reported less fluid intake than controls. Few persons reported drinking alcoholic beverages.
Case-control study	Smoking was reported by 61% of the male cases and was a mild risk factor, related more to cancer of the cardia than of the esophagus.
Case-control study	The risk was increased by 70% among those whose parents had esophageal or stomach cancer, but only slightly among those whose spouses had such cancers, suggesting that exposure early in life and/or genetic effects may be involved.
Case-control study	A case-control study of cancer of the esophagus and gastric cardia in Linxian
Case-control study	Background: Although familial clusters of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma have been reported, a familial predisposition to these diseases has not been systematically investigated.
Case-control study	Aims: To determine whether Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal (or oesophagogastric junctional) adenocarcinoma aggregate in families.
Case-control study	Patients and methods: A structured questionnaire eliciting details on reflux symptoms, exposure history, and family history was given to Caucasian case (n=58) subjects with Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, and to Caucasian control (n=106) subjects with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without Barrett's oesophagus.
Case-control study	Reported diagnoses of family members were confirmed by review of medical records.
Case-control study	Results: The presence of a positive family history (that is, first or second degree relative with Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma) was significantly higher among case subjects compared with controls (24% v 5%; p<0.
Case-control study	005). Case subjects were more likely to be older (p<0. 001) and male (74% v 43% male; p<0. 0005) compared with control subjects.
Case-control study	In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, family history was independently associated with the presence of Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (odds ratio 12.
Case-control study	23, 95% confidence interval 3. 34-44. 76) after adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of obesity 10 or more years prior to study enrollment.
Case-control study	Conclusions: Individuals with Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma are more likely to have a positive family history of Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma than individuals without Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma.
Case-control study	A positive family history should be considered when making decisions about screening endoscopy in patients with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux.
Case-control study	Familial aggregation of Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma in Caucasian adults
Cross-sectional study	Background: Barrett's esophagus is often asymptomatic and only a small portion of Barrett's esophagus patients are currently diagnosed and under surveillance.
Cross-sectional study	Therefore, it is important to develop risk prediction models to identify high-risk individuals with Barrett's esophagus.
Cross-sectional study	Familial aggregation of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma for individuals with a family history, raise the necessity of including genetic factors in the prediction model.
Cross-sectional study	Methods to determine risk prediction models using both risk covariates and ascertained family data are not well developed.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: We developed a Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet) risk prediction model from 787 singly ascertained Barrett's esophagus pedigrees and 92 multiplex Barrett's esophagus pedigrees, fitting a multivariate logistic model that incorporates family history and clinical risk factors.
Cross-sectional study	The eight risk factors, age, sex, education level, parental status, smoking, heartburn frequency, regurgitation frequency, and use of acid suppressant, were included in the model.
Cross-sectional study	The prediction accuracy was evaluated on the training dataset and an independent validation dataset of 643 multiplex Barrett's esophagus pedigrees.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Our results indicate family information helps to predict Barrett's esophagus risk, and predicting in families improves both prediction calibration and discrimination accuracy.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Our model can predict Barrett's esophagus risk for anyone with family members known to have, or not have, had Barrett's esophagus. It can predict risk for unrelated individuals without knowing any relatives' information.
Cross-sectional study	Impact: Our prediction model will shed light on effectively identifying high-risk individuals for Barrett's esophagus screening and surveillance, consequently allowing intervention at an early stage, and reducing mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Cross-sectional study	Predicting Barrett's Esophagus in Families: An Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet) Model Fitting Clinical Data to a Familial Paradigm
Cross-sectional study	A few case-control studies have been published on familial risks in esophageal cancer. Reliable data on familial risks are needed for prevention and clinical decisions. We used the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database on 10.
Cross-sectional study	1 million individuals and close to 6000 esophageal cancers to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for esophageal cancer in 0-66-year-old offspring by cancers in family members.
Cross-sectional study	Additionally, SIRs for second esophageal cancers were analyzed. The SIR for esophageal cancer was 3. 91 (95% CI 1. 55-7. 35) when a parent presented with esophageal cancer and 4. 91 (95% CI 1. 77-9.
Cross-sectional study	62) when a parent presented with squamous cell carcinoma. The sibling risk for esophageal cancer was increased but was based on 1 pair only. The population-attributable proportion of familial esophageal cancer was 0. 70%.
Cross-sectional study	Risks for second esophageal cancers were increased after upper aerodigestive tract, esophageal, stomach, larynx, and lung cancers.
Cross-sectional study	The data on second cancers suggest that environmental factors are important for esophageal cancer and probably contribute to the familial clustering. However, the high familial risk of 3. 91 is unlikely without the involvement of heritable factors.
Cross-sectional study	The population-attributable proportion of familial esophageal cancer is small.
Cross-sectional study	Familial and second esophageal cancers: a nation-wide epidemiologic study from Sweden
Case-control study	The importance of genetic factors in the etiology of esophageal cancer is uncertain. We addressed the question of heredity in a population-based, nationwide case-control study conducted in Sweden during 1995 through 1997.
Case-control study	The study involved 189 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 262 with cardia adenocarcinoma, 167 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and, for comparison, 820 control subjects.
Case-control study	Familial occurrence of cancer was explored at face-to-face interviews. Logistic regression, with multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs), which estimated relative risk.
Case-control study	Occurrence of esophageal cancer among first-degree relatives did not increase the risk of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case-control study	Neither were there any significant associations with familial occurrence of gastric cancer or other gastrointestinal tumors.
Case-control study	The risk of cardia adenocarcinoma was moderately increased among persons with first-degree relatives with gastric cancer (OR, 1. 6; 95% confidence interval, 1. 0-2. 6).
Case-control study	Familial occurrence of any cancer was not associated with increased risks of any of the three studied tumors. In conclusion, heredity does not seem to contribute importantly to the occurrence of esophageal cancer of any histological type.
Case-control study	A weak association between familial gastric cancer and the risk of cardia cancer may represent a genetic link.
Case-control study	Heredity and risk of cancer of the esophagus and gastric cardia
Case-control study	The worldwide rates for histology- and subsite-specific types of esophageal and gastric cancer reveal strikingly divergent patterns.
Case-control study	The contribution of environmental and genetic factors has been explored in several high-incidence areas, but data on genetic influences are scarce for Western countries.
Case-control study	Using data from a multicenter, population-based, case-control study on 1,143 cases and 695 controls in the United States, we evaluated whether a family history of digestive or other cancers was associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 293), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 221), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (n = 261) or non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 368).
Case-control study	After adjusting for other risk factors, individuals reporting a family history of digestive cancers experienced no increased risk of either type of esophageal cancer but they were prone to adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia [odds ratio (OR) = 1.
Case-control study	34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 91-1. 97] and non-cardia segments (OR =1. 46, 95% CI 1. 03-2. 08).
Case-control study	This familial tendency, particularly for non-cardia gastric tumors, was largely explained by an association with family history of stomach cancer (OR = 2. 52, 95% CI 1. 50-4. 23).
Case-control study	In addition, family history of breast cancer was associated with increased risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1. 74, 95% CI 1. 07-2. 83) and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (OR = 1. 76, 95% CI 1. 09-2. 82).
Case-control study	Also seen were non-significant familial associations of esophageal squamous-cell cancer with prostate cancer as well as non-cardia gastric cancer with leukemia and brain tumors, though these relationships must be interpreted with caution.
Case-control study	Our data point to the role of familial susceptibility to gastric cancer, but not to any form of esophageal cancer, in the United States.
Case-control study	Family history of cancer and risk of esophageal and gastric cancers in the United States
Cross-sectional study	Background and aims: Familial risks for esophageal cancer are not well known, especially for specific histologic types. Methods: We used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to examine familial risks for esophageal cancer in offspring.
Cross-sectional study	Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the risk. Age standardized incidence rates for specific histology types of esophageal cancer were available from Swedish Cancer Registry.
Cross-sectional study	Results: The incidence of male squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) reached its peak rate in 1985 and decreased afterwards. The incidence of adenocarcinoma exceeded that of SCC in 2000 among men.
Cross-sectional study	The SIR for offspring esophageal cancer was significantly increased when a parent presented with esophageal cancer (SIR, 2. 60). The SIRs for adenocarcinoma were 4. 05 and 3.
Cross-sectional study	52 when a parent was diagnosed with SCC and any esophageal cancer, respectively; from maternal probands the SIRs were 10. 47 and 7. 74, respectively. The familial SIR was above unity but not significant for SCC.
Cross-sectional study	For associations with other cancer sites, SCC showed a significantly increased risk when a sibling had lung cancer (SIR, 2. 52).
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: The present study showed that adenocarcinoma became the major histologic type of esophageal cancer in Swedish men around 2000.
Cross-sectional study	For the first time we could show that familial risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma were increased when parents presented with esophageal cancer (particularly SCC). The high risk for adenocarcinoma in such families might be due to heritable effects.
Cross-sectional study	However, because of the limited number of familial cases, the results should be interpreted with caution.

case report	Germline mutations in the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene cause autosomal-dominant conditions such as Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes with variable presentations, including hamartomatous gastrointestinal tumors, dermatologic abnormalities, neurologic symptoms, and elevated cancer risk.
case report	We describe a father and son with extensive hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyposis who both developed early-onset esophageal cancer. Exome sequencing identified a novel germline PTEN frameshift mutation (c. 568_569insC, p. V191Sfs*11).
case report	In addition, a missense mutation of SMAD7 (c. 115G>A, p. G39R) with an allele frequency of 0. 3% in the Exome Variant Server was detected in both affected individuals.
case report	Fluorescence in situ hybridization for PTEN in the resected esophageal cancer specimen demonstrated no PTEN copy loss in malignant cells; however, results of an immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a loss of PTEN protein expression.
case report	While the risks of many cancers are elevated in the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, association between esophageal adenocarcinoma and these syndromes has not been previously reported.
case report	Esophageal adenocarcinoma and extensive polyposis/ganglioneuromatosis could represent less common features of these syndromes, potentially correlating with this novel PTEN frameshift and early protein termination genotype.
case report	Alternatively, because simultaneous disruption of both the PTEN and TGF-β/SMAD4 pathways is associated with development of esophageal cancer in a mouse model and because SMAD4 mutations cause gastrointestinal hamartomas in juvenile polyposis syndrome, the SMAD7 mutation may represent an additional modifier of these individuals' PTEN-mutant phenotype.

Cross-sectional study	The numbers of new cancer cases in 16 common sites occurring in 1980 have been estimated for 24 areas of the world for which the United Nations produces population estimates. For the world as a whole, the total number of new cases was 6.
Cross-sectional study	35 million, almost exactly evenly divided between the developed and developing countries.
Cross-sectional study	In males, the most important sites were lung, stomach, colon/rectum, mouth/pharynx, prostate and oesophagus, and in females breast, cervix, colon/rectum, stomach, corpus uteri and lung.
Cross-sectional study	When the two sexes are combined, stomach cancer emerges as the most common cancer in 1980 (669,400 new cases per year), but this estimate is only slightly greater than that of lung cancer (660,500 new cases), and comparisons with earlier estimates for 1975 suggest that, with declining incidence rates for stomach cancer and the continuing rise for lung cancer, the latter would become the most common cancer in the world by the end of 1981.
Cross-sectional study	The implications for cancer control in the developed and developing countries of the world are discussed.
Cross-sectional study	Estimates of the worldwide frequency of sixteen major cancers in 1980
Case-control study	Background: Golestan Province in north-eastern Iran has one of the highest incidence rates for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) worldwide.
Case-control study	Earlier studies have reported higher incidence rates in the areas of Golestan which are mainly inhabited by individuals of the Turkmen ethnic group.
Case-control study	However, it is not clear whether in those areas the incidence among Turkmens is higher in comparison to non-Turkmens.
Case-control study	Some previous studies have suggested that environmental factors might play a more essential role in ESCC carcinogenesis in Golestan than a genetic background.
Case-control study	If environmental factors instead of a genetic background are the major risk factors, therefore the prevalence of known environmental risk factors would not significantly differ among ESCC cases of different ethnic groups.
Case-control study	To investigate the role of environmental factors versus genetic background by using the above concept, we have compared the prevalence of known risk factors for ESCC among Turkmen and non-Turkmen ESCC cases.
Case-control study	Methods: Study participants were histopathologically proven ESCC cases from Golestan Province. They were recruited in the study from December 2003 to June 2007.
Case-control study	The prevalence of the most important known risk factors for ESCC in Turkmen and non-Turkmen ESCC cases was compared using Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Of 300 ESCC cases recruited in the study, 171 (57. 0%) and 129 (43.
Case-control study	0%) cases were Turkmen and non-Turkmen, respectively.
Case-control study	In the majority of the investigated risk factors which included tobacco, nass, and opium use, hot and extremely hot tea consumption, as well as decreased levels of education; there was no significant difference between Turkmen and non-Turkmen ESCC cases in the prevalence of exposure.
Case-control study	Conclusion: Our findings support the suggestion that a substantial difference between Turkmens and non-Turkmens in terms of genetic susceptibility to ESCC is unlikely. Nevertheless, the moderate effect of genetic factors cannot be ruled out.
Case-control study	Further studies to investigate potential environmental and genetic risk factors of ESCC in Golestan and the interaction between environmental and genetic factors are warranted.

review	Research on esophageal cancer in the People's Republic of China is reviewed. Massive epidemiological studies revealed the prevalence of this disease in China, especially in the Taihang Mountain range areas in the north.
review	Gullet cancer in chickens was also observed in the high-incidence area of Linxian in Henan, suggesting the presence of cancer-causing substances in the environment. Research on the etiology of this cancer has been pursued extensively.
review	Moldy food and pickled vegetables were shown to contain carcinogens. In chemical etiology, nitrosamines and their precursors have received the most attention.
review	The possible roles of trace element deficiencies in the soil, nutritional deficiencies, fungal infection, polycyclic hydrocarbons, and other factors in contributing to the high cancer incidence have been studied.
review	The esophageal cancer problem has also been investigated at the cellular and immunological levels. Mass cytological surveys allowed many cases of early cancer to be detected and treated.
review	Precancerous changes and the use of interventive therapy have been studied in animal models and patients. Prevention, early detection, and early treatment of this cancer have been pursued vigorously in many areas of China.

Cross-sectional study	Background: The etiology of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) in high prevalence regions of China remains unclear. Methods: Endoscopic biopsies were conducted among 7381 inhabitants aged from 25 to 65 of Anyang, China. Results: In this study, 2.
Cross-sectional study	57, 0. 20 and 0. 16% of the participants had mild, moderate and severe squamous dysplasia, respectively; 0. 19 and 0. 08% showed squamous carcinoma in situ and invasive ESCC. Using deep well (depth >100 meters) as water source (odds ratio=0.
Cross-sectional study	72, 95% confidence interval: 0. 54-0. 96) was negatively associated with ESCC and its precursors, whereas tobacco and alcohol use were not significantly associated with ESCC.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Water source and other factors in this region need further evaluation by longitudinal studies.
Cross-sectional study	Prevalence and risk factors for esophageal squamous cell cancer and precursor lesions in Anyang, China: a population-based endoscopic survey
Case-control study	A case-control study involving interviews with the next of kin or close friends of 120 black males who recently died of esophageal cancer and 250 similarly aged black males who died of other causes was undertaken to discover reasons for the exceptionally high mortality from this cancer in Washington, D.
Case-control study	C. The age-adjusted annual death rate in Washington, D. C. , for nonwhite males, 1970-75, was 28. 6/100,000, far higher than the national rate of 12. 4/100,000 and the rates in other metropolitan areas of the country.
Case-control study	The major factor responsible for the excess was alcoholic beverage consumption, with an estimated 81% of the esophageal cancers attributed to its use; high use of alcoholic beverages was also found among the controls.
Case-control study	The relative risk (RR) of esophageal cancer associated with use of alcoholic beverages was 6. 4 (95% confidence interval=2. 5, 16. 4).
Case-control study	The RR increased with amount of ethanol consumed and was highest among drinkers of hard liquor, although the risk was also elevated among consumers of wine and/or beer only. The RR associated with cigarette smoking was 1. 9 (1. 0, 3.
Case-control study	5) when controls with smoking-related causes of death were excluded but declined to 1. 5 (0. 7, 3. 0) when adjusted for ethanol consumption.
Case-control study	Significant differences of approximately twofold were found between low and high levels of a) consumption of fresh or frozen meat and fish, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products and eggs and b) relative weight (wt/ht2).
Case-control study	The inverse trends with these general measures of nutritional status were not explained by alcoholic beverage consumption or socioeconomic status as measured by educational level.
Case-control study	Esophageal cancer among black men in Washington, D.C. I. Alcohol, tobacco, and other risk factors
Case-control study	Background: Incidence rates for adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia have risen steeply over the last few decades. To determine risk factors for these tumors, we conducted a multicenter, population-based, case-control study.
Case-control study	Methods: The study included 554 subjects newly diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, 589 subjects newly diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or other gastric adenocarcinomas, and 695 control subjects.
Case-control study	Estimates of risk (odds ratios [ORs] and corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were calculated for the four tumor types separately and for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas combined.
Case-control study	Results: Risk of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas combined was increased among current cigarette smokers (OR = 2. 4; 95% = 1. 7-3.
Case-control study	4), with little reduction observed until 30 years after smoking cessation; this risk rose with increasing intensity and duration of smoking. Risk of these tumors was not related to beer (OR = 0. 8; 95% CI = 0. 6-1. 1) or liquor (OR = 1. 1; 95% CI = 0.
Case-control study	8-1. 4) consumption, but it was reduced for drinking wine (OR = 0. 6; 95% CI = 0. 5-0. 8).
Case-control study	Similar ORs were obtained for the development of noncardia gastric adenocarcinomas in relation to tobacco and alcohol use, but higher ORs were obtained for the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
Case-control study	For all four tumor types, risks were higher among those with low income or education. Conclusions: Smoking is a major risk factor for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, accounting for approximately 40% of cases.
Case-control study	Implications: Because of the long lag time before risk of these tumors is reduced among ex-smokers, smoking may affect early stage carcinogenesis.
Case-control study	The increase in smoking prevalence during the first two thirds of this century may be reflected in the rising incidence of these tumors in the past few decades among older individuals. The recent decrease in smoking may not yet have had an impact.
Case-control study	Tobacco, alcohol, and socioeconomic status and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia
Cohort study	Background: Alcohol consumption has both adverse and beneficial effects on survival. We examined the balance of these in a large prospective study of mortality among U. S. adults.
Cohort study	Methods: Of 490,000 men and women (mean age, 56 years; range, 30 to 104) who reported their alcohol and tobacco use in 1982, 46,000 died during nine years of follow-up.
Cohort study	We compared cause-specific and rates of death from all causes across categories of base-line alcohol consumption, adjusting for other risk factors, and related drinking and smoking habits to the cumulative probability of dying between the ages of 35 and 69 years.
Cohort study	Results: Causes of death associated with drinking were cirrhosis and alcoholism; cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, and liver combined; breast cancer in women; and injuries and other external causes in men.
Cohort study	The mortality from breast cancer was 30 percent higher among women reporting at least one drink daily than among nondrinkers (relative risk, 1. 3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 1 to 1. 6).
Cohort study	The rates of death from all cardiovascular diseases were 30 to 40 percent lower among men (relative risk, 0. 7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 7 to 0. 8) and women (relative risk, 0. 6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 6 to 0.
Cohort study	7) reporting at least one drink daily than among nondrinkers, with little relation to the level of consumption. The overall death rates were lowest among men and women reporting about one drink daily.
Cohort study	Mortality from all causes increased with heavier drinking, particularly among adults under age 60 with lower risk of cardiovascular disease.
Cohort study	Alcohol consumption was associated with a small reduction in the overall risk of death in middle age (ages 35 to 69), whereas smoking approximately doubled this risk.
Cohort study	Conclusions: In this middle-aged and elderly population, moderate alcohol consumption slightly reduced overall mortality.
Cohort study	The benefit depended in part on age and background cardiovascular risk and was far smaller than the large increase in risk produced by tobacco.
Cohort study	Alcohol consumption and mortality among middle-aged and elderly U.S. adults
Case-control study	Background and aims: Alcohol has been declared a carcinogen for cancers of the esophagus, although the evidence relates largely to the squamous subtype. Evidence for an effect on adenocarcinomas is scant and inconsistent.
Case-control study	Methods: We compared nationwide samples of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) (n=365) or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJAC) (n=426) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (n=303) with controls sampled from a population register (n=1580).
Case-control study	We used generalized additive models to assess nonlinear effects of self-reported alcohol intake on cancer risk, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariate logistic and piecewise regression.
Case-control study	Results: We observed no association between average weekly alcohol intake and EAC or EGJAC risk. For ESCC, the relationship with alcohol was nonlinear.
Case-control study	At intakes of less than 170 g/wk there was no significant association; at greater than this level, there was a significant linear effect (OR, 1. 03; 95% CI, 1. 02-1. 05 per 10 g alcohol/wk).
Case-control study	For ESCC, but not EAC or EGJAC, a statistically significant multiplicative interaction between smoking and alcohol was observed (P=. 02). In analyses by beverage type, ESCC risks, but not EAC or EGJAC, increased linearly with beer intake (OR, 1.
Case-control study	05; 95% CI, 1. 04-1. 07). Those who drank modest levels of wine (<50-90 g/wk) or port or spirits (<10-20 g/wk) had significantly lower risks of all 3 cancers than nondrinkers; higher intakes were associated with increased risks of ESCC only.
Case-control study	Conclusions: Alcohol intake above the recommended US dietary guidelines significantly increases the risk of ESCC, but not EAC or EGJAC. Smoking modifies the effect of alcohol intake on ESCC risk.
Case-control study	Alcohol consumption and the risks of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
meta analysis	Quantification of the association between alcohol drinking and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an open issue, particularly among light alcohol drinkers, never-smokers, and Asian populations, in which some high-risk polymorphisms in alcohol metabolizing genes are more prevalent.
meta analysis	To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using 40 case-control and 13 cohort studies that reported on the risk associated with alcohol drinking for at least three levels of consumption.
meta analysis	In studies adjusted for age, sex, and tobacco smoking, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between light alcohol drinking (≤ 12. 5 g/d) and risk of ESCC was 1. 38 (1. 14-1. 67).
meta analysis	The association was slightly stronger in Asian countries than in other populations. The adjusted RRs (95% CIs) were 2. 62 (2. 07-3. 31) for moderate drinking (>12. 5-<50 g/d) and 5. 54 (3. 92-7.
meta analysis	28) for high alcohol intake (≥50 g/d); the RRs were slightly higher in non-Asian populations. In prospective studies, the RR (95% CI) was 1. 35 (0. 92-1. 98) for light, 2. 15 (1. 55-2. 98) for moderate, and 3. 35 (2. 06-5.
meta analysis	46) for high alcohol intakes; light drinking showed an association with ESCC in Asia (five studies) but not in other regions (three studies). Among never-smokers (nine studies), the RR (95% CI) was 0. 74 (0. 47-1. 16) for light, 1. 54 (1. 09-2.
meta analysis	17) for moderate, and 3. 09 (1. 75-5. 46) for high intakes. This meta-analysis further corroborates the association of moderate and high alcohol intake with risk of ESCC and provides risk estimates based on multiple prospective studies.
meta analysis	Light alcohol intake appears to be associated to ESCC mainly in studies in Asia, which suggests a possible role of genetic susceptibility factors.
meta analysis	Alcohol drinking and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with focus on light-drinkers and never-smokers: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Cohort study	Background: Historically, US women started smoking at a later age than men and had lower relative risks for smoking-related cancers.
Cohort study	However, more recent birth cohorts of women and men have similar smoking histories and have now reached the high-risk age for cancer. The impact of these changes on cancer incidence has not been systematically examined.
Cohort study	Methods: Relative risks (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and attributable fractions were calculated for cigarette smoking and incidence of 20 smoking-related cancers in 186 057 women and 266 074 men of the National Institutes of Health-AARP cohort, aged 50 to 71 years in 1995 and followed for 11 years.
Cohort study	Results: In the cohort, which included participants born between 1924 and 1945, most women and men started smoking as teenagers.
Cohort study	RRs for current vs never smoking were similar in women and men for the following cancers: lung squamous-cell (RR women: 121. 4, 95% CI: 57. 3-257. 4; RR men:114. 6, 95% CI: 61. 2-214. 4), lung adenocarcinoma (RR women: 11. 7, 95% CI: 9. 8-14.
Cohort study	0; RR men: 15. 6, 95% CI: 12. 5-19. 6), laryngeal (RR women: 37. 0, 95% CI: 14. 9-92. 3; RR men: 13. 8, 95% CI: 9. 3-20. 2), oral cavity-pharyngeal (RR women:4. 4, 95% CI: 3. 3-6. 0; RR men: 3. 8, 95% CI: 3. 0-4.
Cohort study	7), oesophageal squamous cell (RR women: 7. 3, 95% CI: 3. 5-15. 5; RR men: 6. 2, 95% CI: 2. 8-13. 7), bladder (RR women: 4. 7, 95% CI: 3. 7-5. 8; RR men: 4. 0, 95% CI: 3. 5-4. 5), colon (RR women: 1. 3, 95% CI: 1. 2-1. 5; RR men: 1. 3, 95% CI: 1. 1-1.
Cohort study	4), and at other sites, with similar attributable fractions. Conclusions: RRs for current smoking and incidence of many smoking-related cancers are now similar in US women and men, likely reflecting converging smoking patterns.
Cohort study	Impact of changing US cigarette smoking patterns on incident cancer: risks of 20 smoking-related cancers among the women and men of the NIH-AARP cohort
Cohort study	Context: In recent decades, there has been a rapid and substantial increase in tobacco consumption in China, particularly by men, but little is known from local epidemiologic studies about the pattern of smoking-related deaths.
Cohort study	Objective: To assess the current health effects of cigarette smoking in Shanghai, China. Design: Prospective observational study of mortality in relation to cigarette smoking. Setting: Eleven factories in urban Shanghai.
Cohort study	Subjects: A total of 9351 adults (6494 men and 2857 women) aged 35 to 64 years at baseline survey during the 1970s. Outcome measures: All-cause and cause-specific mortality. Results: During an average follow-up of 16 years, 881 men and 207 women died.
Cohort study	Among men, 61% had described themselves as current cigarette smokers at baseline, and their overall mortality was significantly greater than that of nonsmokers (relative risk [RR], 1. 4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 2-1. 7; P<. 001).
Cohort study	The excess was almost twice as great (RR, 1. 8; 95% CI, 1. 5-2. 2 [corrected]; P<. 001) among the men who had begun smoking before the age of 25 years and was significantly associated with the number of cigarettes smoked (P<.
Cohort study	001 for trend) after adjustment for other major risk factors. The chief sources of the excess were lung cancer (RR, 3. 8; 95% CI, 2. 1-6. 8; P<. 001), esophageal cancer (RR, 3. 6; 95% CI, 1. 2-10. 5; P=. 02), liver cancer (RR, 2. 0; 95% CI, 1. 1-3.
Cohort study	7; P=. 03), coronary heart disease (RR, 1. 8; 95% CI, 1. 0-3. 2; P=. 04), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR, 2. 5; 95% CI, 1. 4-4. 4; P<. 01).
Cohort study	Among the men in this Chinese population, about 20% (95% CI, 12%-29%) of all deaths during the study period could be attributed to cigarette smoking.
Cohort study	Of these deaths, one third involved lung cancer, one third involved other cancers, and one third involved other diseases.
Cohort study	Only 7% of women described themselves as current cigarette smokers at baseline, but among them there was also a statistically significant excess of overall mortality (RR, 1. 7; 95% CI, 1. 2-2. 5; P<. 01).
Cohort study	Conclusions: Cigarette smoking is already a major cause of death in China, and among middle-aged Shanghai men, about 20% of all deaths during the 1980s were due to smoking.
Cohort study	The excess was greatest among men who began smoking before the age of 25 years, about 47% of whom would, at 1987 mortality rates, die between the ages of 35 and 69 years (compared with only 29% of nonsmokers).
Cohort study	These estimates reflect the consequences of past smoking patterns. The future health effects of current smoking patterns are likely to be greater because of the recent large increase in cigarette consumption, particularly at younger ages, in China.

review	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for about 90% of the 456,000 incident esophageal cancers each year. Regions of high incidence include Eastern to Central Asia, along the Rift Valley in East Africa, and into South Africa.
review	There are many causes of ESCC, which vary among regions. Early studies in France associated smoking cigarettes and heavy alcohol consumption with high rates of ESCC, but these factors cannot explain the high incidence in other regions.
review	We discuss other risk factors for ESCC, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a variety of sources, high-temperature foods, diet, and oral health and the microbiome-all require further research.
review	A growing list of defined genomic regions affects susceptibility, but large genome-wide association studies have been conducted with ethnic Chinese subjects only; more studies are called for in the rest of Asia and Africa.
review	ESCC has been understudied, but growing infrastructure in more high-incidence countries will allow rapid progress in our understanding.

Cohort study	Background: The sale of cigars in the United States has been increasing for the past six years. Cigar smoking is a known risk factor for certain cancers and for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Cohort study	However, unlike the relation between cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease, the association between cigar smoking and cardiovascular disease has not been clearly established.
Cohort study	Methods: We performed a cohort study among 17,774 men 30 to 85 years of age at base line (from 1964 through 1973) who were enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente health plan and who reported that they had never smoked cigarettes and did not currently smoke a pipe.
Cohort study	Those who smoked cigars (1546 men) and those who did not (16,228) were followed from 1971 through the end of 1995 for a first hospitalization for or death from a major cardiovascular disease or COPD, and through the end of 1996 for a diagnosis of cancer.
Cohort study	Results: In multivariate analysis, cigar smokers, as compared with nonsmokers, were at higher risk for coronary heart disease (relative risk, 1. 27; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 12 to 1. 45), COPD (relative risk, 1.
Cohort study	45; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 10 to 1. 91), and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (relative risk, 2. 02; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 01 to 4. 06) and lung (relative risk, 2. 14; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 12 to 4.
Cohort study	11), with evidence of dose-response effects. There appeared to be a synergistic relation between cigar smoking and alcohol consumption with respect to the risk of oropharyngeal cancers and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Independently of other risk factors, regular cigar smoking can increase the risk of coronary heart disease, COPD, and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract and lung.

Case-control study	Pipe smoking has been related to the risk of cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract, but quantification of the risk for exclusive pipe smokers is still limited.
Case-control study	To analyse the association between exclusive pipe smoking and cancers of the upper digestive tract, we used data from a series of case-control studies conducted in Italy and Switzerland between 1984 and 1999.
Case-control study	After excluding cigarette and cigar smokers, 41 male oral and pharyngeal cancer cases, 52 male oesophageal cancer cases and 1,032 male controls were included in the present analysis.
Case-control study	Odds ratios (OR) of cancers were estimated by the mean of unconditional multivariate logistic regression, including terms for age, study centre, education, body mass index, and alcohol drinking.
Case-control study	Compared to never smokers, exclusive pipe smokers had an OR of 8. 7 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 4. 0-18. 9] of all upper digestive tract cancers. The OR was 12. 6 for oral and pharyngeal and 7. 2 for oesophageal cancer.
Case-control study	Pipe smokers who were also heavy alcohol drinkers had an OR of 38. 8 (95% CI: 13. 6-110. 9) as compared to never smokers and light drinkers. Thus, pipe smoking and heavy alcohol drinking appears to interact at least on a multiplicative model.

meta analysis	Objectives: Tobacco and alcohol use are established risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We sought to determine whether these factors act synergistically to increase the risk of ESCC.
meta analysis	Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in multiple electronic databases regardless of language. Eligible studies were population-based case-control or cohort studies of ESCC that assessed the effects of tobacco and/or alcohol.
meta analysis	Departures from multiplicative effects were quantified by the synergy factor (SF); SF >1 indicates positive synergy. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate summary-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and the summary crude SF using random-effect models.
meta analysis	Heterogeneity was defined by Cochrane's Q P<0. 10 and the inconsistency index. Results: Systematic review identified 7,629 unique citations, of which 5 were eligible.
meta analysis	Either tobacco or alcohol use was associated with a 20-30% increased risk for ESCC compared with nonuse, but the use of both was associated with an approximately threefold risk for ESCC; the summary-adjusted OR for combined alcohol and tobacco use was 3.
meta analysis	28 (95% confidence interval (CI)=2. 11, 508; Cochrane's Q P value=0. 05; I(2)=55. 3%). The summary SF for ever-use of both tobacco and alcohol was 1. 85 (95% CI=1. 45, 2. 38; Cochrane's Q P value=0. 49; I(2)=0. 0%).
meta analysis	Conclusions: There is a positive synergistic effect of alcohol and tobacco use for ESCC. The observed combined effect of the two factors is almost double if there were no synergy.
meta analysis	Efforts for controlling the burden of ESCC should focus on individuals who use both alcohol and tobacco.

Case-control study	The role of alcohol consumption in oesophageal cancer in Normandy has been studied by a retrospective study of 312 male cases and 869 controls.
Case-control study	The linear relationship between the logarithm of risk and overall daily alcohol consumption was confirmed after adjustment for tobacco.
Case-control study	The role of each specific alcoholic beverage was further investigated by computing relative risks for individuals consuming a given beverage and for those drinking other beverages only, within each overall alcohol consumption category.
Case-control study	It is concluded: (1) that there is a linear relationship between the logarithm of risk of oesophageal cancer and overall daily ethanol consumption, whatever the beverage; (2) that the effect is more marked for strong beverages; (3) that there is an additional risk related to apple brandy and cider.
Case-control study	Oesophageal cancer and alcohol consumption; importance of type of beverage
Case-control study	To evaluate whether the fivefold greater incidence rate of squamous-cell esophageal cancer in Black compared with White men is due to type of alcoholic beverage consumed or to other qualitative differences in alcohol consumption, we conducted a population-based case-control study with 373 males diagnosed with squamous-cell esophageal cancer (124 Whites and 249 Blacks) and 1,364 male controls (750 Whites and 614 Blacks) from three geographic areas in the United States.
Case-control study	Included were all histologically confirmed cases newly diagnosed from 1 August 1986 through 30 April 1989, among White and Black men aged 30 to 79 years.
Case-control study	Risks varied to some extent according to type of alcohol used, with beer a stronger contributor in Whites, and wine and liquor stronger contributors in Blacks.
Case-control study	However, most of the differences in the odds ratios by type of alcohol and race were eliminated after controlling for average weekly amount of total alcohol consumed.
Case-control study	Thus, while alcohol use in all forms is an important risk factor for squamous-cell esophageal cancer in Whites and Blacks, type of alcoholic beverage used does not appear to account for the racial differences in incidence.

Case-control study	Many human cancers are caused by synthetic or natural chemical compounds in the environment. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has been reported to be epidemiologically associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption.
Case-control study	We studied the association between genetic polymorphisms of tobacco- and alcohol-related metabolizing enzymes and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility.
Case-control study	We examined genetic polymorphisms of the CYPIA1, GSTM1, CYPIIE1, ADH2, and ALDH2 genes in 94 Japanese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 70 unrelated healthy Japanese persons.
Case-control study	There were no significant differences between healthy controls and patients with esophageal cancer in the polymorphisms of the CYPIA1, GSTM1, and CYPIIE1 genes.
Case-control study	On the other hand, there were significant differences in the ADH2 and ALDH2 polymorphisms between healthy controls and esophageal cancer patients.
Case-control study	The ADH2(1)/ADH2(1) and ALDH2(1)/ALDH2(2) genotypes were independently and significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients than in healthy controls.
Case-control study	Furthermore, persons with the combined genotypes ADH2(1)/ADH2(1) and ALDH2(1)/ALDH2(2) were at extraordinarily high risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with an odds ratio of 17. 9 (p < 0. 001).
Case-control study	Thus polymorphisms of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, that is, ADH2 and ALDH2, may be useful for screening patients at high risk for esophageal cancer, which might facilitate clarification of esophageal tumorigenesis and prevention of esophageal cancer.

Case-control study	Alcohol is an important risk factor for upper aerodigestive cancers and is principally metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes.
Case-control study	We have investigated six ADH genetic variants in over 3,800 aerodigestive cancer cases and 5,200 controls from three individual studies.
Case-control study	Gene variants rs1229984 (ADH1B) and rs1573496 (ADH7) were significantly protective against aerodigestive cancer in each individual study and overall (P = 10(-10) and 10(-9), respectively).
Case-control study	These effects became more apparent with increasing alcohol consumption (P for trend = 0. 0002 and 0. 065, respectively).
Case-control study	Both gene effects were independent of each other, implying that multiple ADH genes may be involved in upper aerodigestive cancer etiology.
Case-control study	Multiple ADH genes are associated with upper aerodigestive cancers
review	Public health guidelines aim to limit the consumption of alcoholic beverages worldwide and the subsequent health burden. In particular, alcohol consumption is an avoidable risk factor for cancer.
review	In human beings, ethanol in alcoholic drinks is mainly oxidised in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, and is further detoxified to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenases.
review	Functional variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism result in differences between individuals in exposure to carcinogenic acetaldehyde, suggesting a possible interaction of genetic susceptibility and alcohol exposure in cancer.
review	We reviewed available studies of the combined effects of alcohol drinking and genetic polymorphisms on alcohol-related cancer risk. Most available data were for polymorphisms in alcohol and folate metabolism.
review	We give an overview of published studies on the combined effects of alcohol drinking and polymorphisms in genes for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), cytochrome P450 2E1, and methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase on the risk of alcohol-related cancer.
review	Current data lend support to a role of polymorphisms ADH1B and ALDH2 combined with alcohol consumption in cancer. Other available data are insufficient or inconclusive, highlighting the need for additional studies.

Case series	Epidemiologic studies have implicated the involvement of environmental factors in the etiology of esophageal cancer (EC).
Case series	Our previous data have indicated that EC patients and their blood relatives show genomic instability and are deficient in repair of DNA damage induced by N-nitroso-compounds and related genotoxic agents.
Case series	Thus, exposure to high levels of N-alkylnitrosamines, which are known animal carcinogens and which induce alkyl adducts in DNA, may be causally linked to EC.
Case series	Among the alkyl adducts, O6-alkylguanine was shown to be the critical one related to carcinogenic lesions; its repair varies widely in a tissue-specific fashion. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is responsible for its repair.
Case series	Hence, inactivating mutations in this protein would impair the efficiency of the repair process.
Case series	To screen for possible mutations in the MGMT polypeptide in EC patients, we analyzed a highly conserved region of the MGMT gene in 40 EC tissues and lymphocytes of 6 high-risk EC family members from high EC areas of Northern China by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism and by direct sequencing of PCR products.
Case series	Ten base substitutions (point mutations) within 8 codons of 7 EC samples were identified. However, no germline mutation was found in the high EC families studied so far.
Case series	Concurrent study in 30 pairs of fresh EC tissues and their adjacent normal mucosa by Southern blot and Western blot analyses showed deletion of the MGMT gene in 2 samples.
Case series	Thus, the high frequency of mutations (7/40) and deletions (2/30) of the MGMT gene may be partially responsible for the overall high mutation rate observed in EC tissues.

Cross-sectional study	Several commonly used raw foodstuffs from a high risk esophageal cancer region in Kashmir (India) were analysed for the presence of N-nitroso compounds.
Cross-sectional study	The food items were selected on the basis of their frequent consumption with particular emphasis on the preserved foods (dried, pickled and smoked) and those which are unique to the region.
Cross-sectional study	Nine out of 11 food items were found to contain low concentrations of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrososarcosine (NSAR), N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) and N-nitrosothaizolidine-4-carboxylic acid (NTCA).

Cross-sectional study	A total of 31 corn samples collected from households in the counties of Cixian and Linxian of the People's Republic of China, where high incidences of esophageal cancer have been reported, were analyzed for fumonisin B1 (FB1), aflatoxin, and total trichothecene mycotoxins.
Cross-sectional study	High levels of FB1 (18 to 155 ppm; mean, 74 ppm) were found in 16 of the samples that showed heavy mold contamination. FB1, at lower levels (20 to 60 ppm; mean, 35.
Cross-sectional study	3 ppm), was also found in 15 samples, collected from the same households, that did not show any visible mold contamination. The levels of aflatoxin in the samples were low (1 to 38. 4 ppb; mean, 8. 61 ppb).
Cross-sectional study	High levels of total type-A trichothecenes were also found in the moldy corn samples (139 to 2,030 ppb; mean, 627 ppb).
Cross-sectional study	Immunochromatography of selected samples revealed that these samples contained T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, iso-neosolaniol, monoacetoxyscirpenol, and several other type-A trichothecenes.
Cross-sectional study	The concentration of total type-B trichothecenes in 15 moldy corn samples was in the range of 470 to 5,826 ppb (mean, 2,359 ppb). High levels (3. 7 to 5.
Cross-sectional study	0 mg/g) of FB1 were produced in corn in the laboratory by five Fusarium moniliforme strains isolated from the moldy corn.

Cross-sectional study	Although an estimated 10% to 25% of the world's population chews betel quid, this practice is virtually unknown in the United States.
Cross-sectional study	Health care professionals coming into contact with immigrants and refugees from India, New Guinea, and Southeast Asia will increasingly notice this habit.
Cross-sectional study	Possible hazards associated with the chewing of the various ingredients of the quid include oral cancer and an addictive potential as strong as for cigarettes.
Cross-sectional study	We surveyed a group of Cambodian refugee women who are addicted to betel nut and its associated components.
Cross-sectional study	Participant-directed interviews uncovered some of the cultural meanings surrounding the ritual of preparing and using the betel quid and the role of culture in the beliefs and behaviors related to chemical addiction.

Case-control study	Oesophageal cancer remains an important public health problem worldwide.
Case-control study	This multicentre matched case-control study examined the chewing areca nut alone, betel quid with tobacco, oral snuff (snuff dipping) and cigarette smoking as the risk factors for oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.
Case-control study	We enrolled 91 cases of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and 364 matched controls from three tertiary-care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data through face-to-face interview of the participants.
Case-control study	Multivariable conditional logistic regression model showed that after adjusting for the effect of ethnicity, ever chewed areca nut alone (adjusted matched odds ratio (mOR(adj))=3. 7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1. 6-8.
Case-control study	5), ever chewed betel quid with tobacco (mOR(adj)=12. 8; 95% CI: 6. 3-26. 2), ever practiced snuff dipping (mOR(adj)=4. 3; 95% CI: 1. 6-11. 7) and ever smoked cigarettes (mOR(adj)=2. 9; 95% CI: 1. 4-5.
Case-control study	9) were significantly and independently associated with oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma status. The adjusted summary population attributable risk (PAR) percent for all four substances together was 67. 0.
Case-control study	Furthermore, despite incomplete synergy, there was manifold increase in the risk of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, if the respondents ever smoked cigarettes and ever chewed betel quid with tobacco (mOR(adj)=21. 4; 95% CI: 6. 3-72.
Case-control study	4) or if they ever smoked cigarettes and ever practiced snuff dipping (mOR(adj)=14. 4; 95% CI: 2. 3-91. 1). The adjusted PAR (%) was higher for the dual practice of smoking cigarettes and chewing betel quid with tobacco (64.
Case-control study	3) than the dual practice of smoking cigarettes and snuff dipping (32. 2).
Case-control study	Public awareness to curtail the addiction to these substances may result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and related mortality in this and similar settings.

review	Coffee, tea and maté may cause esophageal cancer (EC) by causing thermal injury to the esophageal mucosa. If so, the risk of EC attributable to thermal injury could be large in populations in which these beverages are commonly consumed.
review	In addition, these drinks may cause or prevent EC via their chemical constituents.
review	Therefore, a large number of epidemiologic studies have investigated the association of an indicator of amount or temperature of use of these drinks or other hot foods and beverages with risk of EC.
review	We conducted a systematic review of these studies and report the results for amount and temperature of use separately. By searching PubMed and the ISI, we found 59 eligible studies.
review	For coffee and tea, there was little evidence for an association between amount of use and EC risk; however, the majority of studies showed an increased risk of EC associated with higher drinking temperature which was statistically significant in most of them.
review	For maté drinking, the number of studies was limited, but they consistently showed that EC risk increased with both amount consumed and temperature, and these 2 were independent risk factors.
review	For other hot foods and drinks, over half of the studies showed statistically significant increased risks of EC associated with higher temperature of intake.
review	Overall, the available results strongly suggest that high-temperature beverage drinking increases the risk of EC.
review	Future studies will require standardized strategies that allow for combining data and results should be reported by histological subtypes of EC.

Case-control study	Objective: To investigate the association between tea drinking habits in Golestan province, northern Iran, and risk of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Design: Population based case-control study.
Case-control study	In addition, patterns of tea drinking and temperature at which tea was drunk were measured among healthy participants in a cohort study. Setting: Golestan province, northern Iran, an area with a high incidence of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Case-control study	Participants: 300 histologically proved cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 571 matched neighbourhood controls in the case-control study and 48 582 participants in the cohort study.
Case-control study	Main outcome measure: Odds ratio of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with drinking hot tea. Results: Nearly all (98%) of the cohort participants drank black tea regularly, with a mean volume consumed of over one litre a day. 39.
Case-control study	0% of participants drank their tea at temperatures less than 60 degrees C, 38. 9% at 60-64 degrees C, and 22. 0% at 65 degrees C or higher.
Case-control study	A moderate agreement was found between reported tea drinking temperature and actual temperature measurements (weighted kappa 0. 49).
Case-control study	The results of the case-control study showed that compared with drinking lukewarm or warm tea, drinking hot tea (odds ratio 2. 07, 95% confidence interval 1. 28 to 3. 35) or very hot tea (8. 16, 3. 93 to 16.
Case-control study	9) was associated with an increased risk of oesophageal cancer. Likewise, compared with drinking tea four or more minutes after being poured, drinking tea 2-3 minutes after pouring (2. 49, 1. 62 to 3. 83) or less than two minutes after pouring (5.
Case-control study	41, 2. 63 to 11. 1) was associated with a significantly increased risk. A strong agreement was found between responses to the questions on temperature at which tea was drunk and interval from tea being poured to being drunk (weighted kappa 0. 68).
Case-control study	Conclusion: Drinking hot tea, a habit common in Golestan province, was strongly associated with a higher risk of oesophageal cancer.

Case-control study	Epidemiological studies suggested drinking green tea is inversely associated with esophageal cancer but results remain inconclusive. Moreover, inconsistent observations found high temperature drinks are associated with esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	A population-based case-control study was conducted in a high-risk area (Dafeng) and a low-risk area (Ganyu) of esophageal cancer in Jiangsu province China from 2003 to 2007.
Case-control study	It aimed to explore green tea drinking and tea temperature with the risk of esophageal cancer, and to compare the difference between different risk regions.
Case-control study	Using identical protocols, 1,520 cases and 3,879 healthy controls were recruited as study subjects in 2 regions. Detailed information was collected to assess green tea drinking habits.
Case-control study	Unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain OR and 95% CI. Results showed that ever drinking green tea elevated OR in both counties (Dafeng OR = 1. 2, 95% CI = 0. 9-1. 5; Ganyu: OR = 1. 9, 95% CI = 1. 4-2. 4).
Case-control study	Drinking tea at high temperature was found to increase cancer risk in both areas (Dafeng: OR = 1. 9, 95% CI = 1. 2-2. 9; Ganyu OR = 3. 1 95% CI = 2. 2-4. 3).
Case-control study	However, after further adjustment for tea temperature, ever drinking tea was not related to cancer in either county (Dafeng: OR = 1. 0, 95% CI = 0. 7-1. 3; Ganyu: OR = 1. 3, 95% CI = 0. 9-1. 7).
Case-control study	For dose-response relationships, we observed positive relationship with monthly consumption of tea (p for trend = 0. 067) and tea concentration (p for trend = 0. 006) after further adjustment for tea temperature.
Case-control study	In conclusion, green tea drinking was not inversely associated with esophageal cancer in this study. However, drinking tea at high temperatures significantly increased esophageal cancer risk.
Case-control study	There was no obvious difference of green tea drinking between low- and high-risk areas.
Case-control study	Green tea drinking, high tea temperature and esophageal cancer in high- and low-risk areas of Jiangsu Province, China: a population-based case-control study
Cohort study	Previous studies have reported an association between hot tea drinking and risk of esophageal cancer, but no study has examined this association using prospectively and objectively measured tea drinking temperature.
Cohort study	We examined the association of tea drinking temperature, measured both objectively and subjectively at study baseline, with future risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a prospective study.
Cohort study	We measured tea drinking temperature using validated methods and collected data on several other tea drinking habits and potential confounders of interest at baseline in the Golestan Cohort Study, a population-based prospective study of 50,045 individuals aged 40-75 years, established in 2004-2008 in northeastern Iran.
Cohort study	Study participants were followed-up for a median duration of 10. 1 years (505,865 person-years). During 2004-2017, 317 new cases of ESCC were identified. The objectively measured tea temperature (HR 1. 41, 95% CI 1. 10-1. 81; for ≥60°C vs.
Cohort study	<60°C), reported preference for very hot tea drinking (HR 2. 41, 95% CI 1. 27-4. 56; for "very hot" vs. "cold/lukewarm"), and reported shorter time from pouring tea to drinking (HR 1. 51, 95% CI 1. 01-2. 26; for <2 vs.
Cohort study	≥6 min) were all associated with ESCC risk.
Cohort study	In analysis of the combined effects of measured temperature and amount, compared to those who drank less than 700 ml of tea/day at <60°C, drinking 700 mL/day or more at a higher-temperature (≥60°C) was consistently associated with an about 90% increase in ESCC risk.
Cohort study	Our results substantially strengthen the existing evidence supporting an association between hot beverage drinking and ESCC.
Cohort study	A prospective study of tea drinking temperature and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Cohort study	This article has been corrected. The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a Supplement.
Cohort study	Background: Although consumption of tea at high temperatures has been suggested as a risk factor for esophageal cancer, an association has not been observed consistently, and whether any relationship is independent of alcohol and tobacco exposure has not been evaluated.
Cohort study	Objective: To examine whether high-temperature tea drinking, along with the established risk factors of alcohol consumption and smoking, is associated with esophageal cancer risk.
Cohort study	Design: China Kadoorie Biobank, a prospective cohort study established during 2004 to 2008. Setting: 10 areas across China. Participants: 456 155 persons aged 30 to 79 years.
Cohort study	Those who had cancer at baseline or who reduced consumption of tea, alcohol, or tobacco before baseline were excluded.
Cohort study	Measurements: The usual temperature at which tea was consumed, other tea consumption metrics, and lifestyle behaviors were self-reported once, at baseline. Outcome was esophageal cancer incidence up to 2015. Results: During a median follow-up of 9.
Cohort study	2 years, 1731 incident esophageal cancer cases were documented. High-temperature tea drinking combined with either alcohol consumption or smoking was associated with a greater risk for esophageal cancer than hot tea drinking alone.
Cohort study	Compared with participants who drank tea less than weekly and consumed fewer than 15 g of alcohol daily, those who drank burning-hot tea and 15 g or more of alcohol daily had the greatest risk for esophageal cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 5.
Cohort study	00 [95% CI, 3. 64 to 6. 88]). Likewise, the HR for current smokers who drank burning-hot tea daily was 2. 03 (CI, 1. 55 to 2. 67).
Cohort study	Limitation: Tea consumption was self-reported once, at baseline, leading to potential nondifferential misclassification and attenuation of the association.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Drinking tea at high temperatures is associated with an increased risk for esophageal cancer when combined with excessive alcohol or tobacco use.

Cohort study	Objectives: Red and processed meats could increase cancer risk through several potential mechanisms involving iron, heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and N-nitroso compounds.
Cohort study	Although there have been multiple studies of meat and colorectal cancer, other gastrointestinal malignancies are understudied.
Cohort study	Methods: We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between meat, meat components, and meat cooking by-products and risk of esophageal or gastric cancer in a large cohort study.
Cohort study	During ∼10 years of follow-up, we accrued 215 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 630 esophageal adenocarcinomas, 454 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, and 501 gastric non-cardia adenocarcinomas.
Cohort study	Results: Red meat intake was positively associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR for the top versus bottom quintile=1. 79, 95% CI: 1. 07-3. 01, P for trend=0. 019).
Cohort study	Individuals in the highest intake quintile of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) had an increased risk for gastric cardia cancer (HR=1. 44, 95% CI: 1. 01-2. 07, P for trend=0. 104).
Cohort study	Furthermore, those in the highest quintile of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), or heme iron intake had a suggestive increased risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR=1.
Cohort study	35, 95% CI: 0. 97-1. 89, P for trend=0. 022; HR=1. 45, 95% CI: 0. 99-2. 12, P for trend=0. 463; or HR=1. 47, 95% CI: 0. 99-2. 20, P for trend=0. 063, respectively).
Cohort study	Benzo[a]pyrene, nitrate, and nitrite were not associated with esophageal or gastric cancer.
Cohort study	Conclusions: We found positive associations between red meat intake and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and between DiMeIQx intake and gastric cardia cancer.
Cohort study	Meat consumption and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer in a large prospective study
Cohort study	Background: Prospective data on red and processed meat in relation to risk of subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer are scarce.
Cohort study	We present analyses of association between red and processed meat and the risk of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes within The Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer.
Cohort study	Design: 120 852 individuals aged 55-69 years were recruited in 1986, and meat intake was assessed using a 150-item food frequency questionnaire. After 16.
Cohort study	3 years of follow-up, 107 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 145 esophageal adenocarcinomas, 163 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, 489 gastric non-cardia adenocarcinomas, and 3923 subcohort members were included in a case-cohort analysis.
Cohort study	Results: Processed as well as red meat intake was positively associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in men. Hazard ratios for highest versus lowest quintile of processed and red meat were 3. 47 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 1. 21-9.
Cohort study	94; P for trend: 0. 04] and 2. 66 (95% CI: 0. 94-7. 48; P for trend: 0. 06), respectively. No association was seen for adenocarcinomas or gastric cancer subtypes or for any of the four subtypes among women.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Our findings suggest that red and processed meat consumption is associated with increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in men but not with cancers of other esophageal and gastric subtypes.
Cohort study	Red and processed meat consumption and the risk of esophageal and gastric cancer subtypes in The Netherlands Cohort Study
Cohort study	Background: From March 1986 through May 1991, we conducted a randomized nutritional intervention trial, the General Population Trial, in Linxian, China, a region with epidemic rates of squamous esophageal and adenomatous gastric cardia cancers.
Cohort study	We found that participants who received selenium, beta-carotene, and vitamin E had significantly lower cancer mortality rates than those who did not.
Cohort study	In the current study, we examined the relationship between selenium levels measured in pretrial (1985) sera from participants and the subsequent risk of developing squamous esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric non-cardia cancers during the trial.
Cohort study	Methods: This study was designed and analyzed in accord with a stratified case-cohort sampling scheme, with the six strata defined by sex and three age categories.
Cohort study	We measured serum selenium levels in 590 case subjects with esophageal cancer, 402 with gastric cardia cancers, and 87 with gastric non-cardia cancers as well as in 1062 control subjects.
Cohort study	Relative risks (RRs), absolute risks, and population attributable risk for cancers were estimated on the basis of the Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests are two-sided.
Cohort study	Results: We found highly significant inverse associations of serum selenium levels with the incidence of esophageal (P: for trend <10(-4)) and gastric cardia (P: for trend <10(-6)) cancers.
Cohort study	The RR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for comparison of highest to lowest quartile of serum selenium was 0. 56 (95% CI = 0. 44-0. 71) for esophageal cancer and 0. 47 (95% CI = 0. 33-0. 65) for gastric cardia cancer.
Cohort study	The population proportion of these cancers that is attributable to low selenium levels was 26. 4% (95% CI = 14. 45-38. 36). We found no evidence for a gradient of serum selenium associated with incidence of gastric non-cardia cancer (P: for trend =.
Cohort study	96), with an RR of 1. 07 (95% CI = 0. 55-2. 08) for the highest to lowest quartile of serum selenium.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Our study supports findings from previous prospective studies and randomized trials that variations in selenium levels affect the incidence of certain cancers.
Cohort study	In the United States, where intervention trials of selenium are in the planning stages, consideration should be given to including populations at high risk for squamous esophageal and gastric cardia cancers.
Cohort study	Prospective study of serum selenium levels and incident esophageal and gastric cancers
Cohort study	Background & aims: Selenium may protect against the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA).
Cohort study	Only in very few studies have the associations with ESCC and GCA been investigated, and no epidemiologic studies exist on EAC.
Cohort study	Methods: We studied the association between selenium and risk of ESCC, EAC, and GCA within the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study, conducted among 120,852 men and women aged 55-69 years at baseline.
Cohort study	In September 1986, the cohort members completed a questionnaire on risk factors for cancer and provided toenail clippings for determination of baseline selenium status. After 16.
Cohort study	3 years of follow-up, 64 ESCC, 112 EAC, and 114 GCA cases and 2072 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analysis. Incidence rate ratios (RR) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.
Cohort study	Results: In multivariable analyses of selenium status, we found an inverse association with ESCC (RR(per standard unit increment), 0. 80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0. 67-0. 96) and a borderline significant inverse association with GCA (RR, 0.
Cohort study	91; 95% CI: 0. 80-1. 02). No overall association was observed for EAC (RR, 1. 05; 95% CI: 0. 95-1. 15), but, for women and never smokers, significant inverse associations were found (RR(per standard unit increment), 0. 72; 95% CI: 0. 61-0.
Cohort study	84 and RR(per standard unit increment), 0. 74; 95% CI: 0. 64-0. 86, respectively).
Cohort study	Conclusions: This prospective study supports an inverse association between toenail selenium and risk of ESCC and GCA and suggests an inverse association with risk of EAC in subgroups (women, never smokers, and low antioxidant consumers).
Cohort study	These associations need confirmation.

review	Two nutrition intervention trials were conducted in Linxian, China, where the esophageal/gastric cardia cancer mortality rates are among the highest in the world and there is suspicion that the population's chronic deficiencies of multiple nutrients are etiologically involved.
review	Both trials were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and tested the effect of multiple-vitamin and multiple-mineral supplements in lowering the rates of cancer.
review	In the first trial, the Dysplasia Trial, 3318 individuals with a cytologic diagnosis of esophageal dysplasia received daily vitamin and mineral supplements or placebos for 6 years.
review	The second trial, the General Population Trial, involved 29,584 individuals and used a one-half replicate of a 2(4) fractional factorial design, which enabled the testing of daily supplementation of four different vitamin and mineral combinations and placebo for a period 5 1/4 years.
review	This article describes the design and methods of these studies as well as the baseline characteristics and compliance behavior of the participants in these two trials, the largest cancer chemoprevention studies reported to date.

randomized controlled trial	Background: Epidemiologic evidence indicates that diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of several cancers, including cancers of the esophagus and stomach.
randomized controlled trial	Vitamins and minerals in these foods may contribute to the reduced cancer risk. The people of Linxian County, China, have one of the world's highest rates of esophageal/gastric cardia cancer and a persistently low intake of several micronutrients.
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We sought to determine if dietary supplementation with specific vitamins and minerals can lower mortality from or incidence of cancer as well as mortality from other diseases in Linxian.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Individuals of ages 40-69 were recruited in 1985 from four Linxian communes.
randomized controlled trial	Mortality and cancer incidence during March 1986-May 1991 were ascertained for 29,584 adults who received daily vitamin and mineral supplementation throughout this period.
randomized controlled trial	The subjects were randomly assigned to intervention groups according to a one-half replicate of a 2(4) factorial experimental design.
randomized controlled trial	This design enabled testing for the effects of four combinations of nutrients: (A) retinol and zinc; (B) riboflavin and niacin; (C) vitamin C and molybdenum; and (D) beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium. Doses ranged from one to two times U. S.
randomized controlled trial	Recommended Daily Allowances. Results: A total of 2127 deaths occurred among trial participants during the intervention period.
randomized controlled trial	Cancer was the leading cause of death, with 32% of all deaths due to esophageal or stomach cancer, followed by cerebrovascular disease (25%). Significantly (P =. 03) lower total mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0. 91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.
randomized controlled trial	84-0. 99) occurred among those receiving supplementation with beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium. The reduction was mainly due to lower cancer rates (RR = 0. 87; 95% CI = 0. 75-1. 00), especially stomach cancer (RR = 0. 79; 95% CI = 0. 64-0.
randomized controlled trial	99), with the reduced risk beginning to arise about 1-2 years after the start of supplementation with these vitamins and minerals.
randomized controlled trial	No significant effects on mortality rates from all causes were found for supplementation with retinol and zinc, riboflavin and niacin, or vitamin C and molybdenum.
randomized controlled trial	Patterns of cancer incidence, on the basis of 1298 cases, generally resembled those for cancer mortality.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The findings indicate that vitamin and mineral supplementation of the diet of Linxian adults, particularly with the combination of beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium, may effect a reduction in cancer risk in this population.
randomized controlled trial	Implications: The results on their own are not definitive, but the promising findings should stimulate further research to clarify the potential benefits of micronutrient supplements.
randomized controlled trial	Nutrition intervention trials in Linxian, China: supplementation with specific vitamin/mineral combinations, cancer incidence, and disease-specific mortality in the general population
review	Various issues pertaining to the design of a nutrition intervention trial in Linxian, a county in North Central China where esophageal cancer rates are extraordinarily high among a population with chronic deficiencies of multiple nutrients, are addressed.
review	Two target populations are identified: One is a group of patients diagnosed with severe esophageal dysplasia, the other is the general population of the high-risk area.
review	Interventions involving the supplementation of each group with vitamins and minerals are described, and a rationale is provided for the selection of nutrients and choice of dose levels.
review	Several potential statistical designs are evaluated, with particular emphasis on the balancing of gains in specificity afforded by full and fractional factorial designs against their potential loss in sensitivity compared with the simplest design involving a placebo versus a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement.
review	Some considerations in the design of a nutrition intervention trial in Linxian, People's Republic of China
randomized controlled trial	The population of Linxian in China has one of the world's highest rates for esophageal/gastric cardia cancer, as well as documented nutritional deficiencies.
randomized controlled trial	To determine whether dietary supplementation with a multi-vitamin multi-mineral preparation could reduce the risk of esophageal cancer and favorably influence precursor lesions, 3,318 individuals age 40-69 with cytologically determined grade 1 or grade 2 esophageal dysplasia were randomly assigned to receive either an active multi-vitamin multi-mineral supplement or a placebo.
randomized controlled trial	Pills were distributed at monthly visits and incident cancers or deaths were recorded.
randomized controlled trial	At 30 and 72 months subsequent to randomization all living participants without a known incident cancer were asked to undergo repeat cytological examination of their esophagus.
randomized controlled trial	Based on these procedures participants were classified as having no dysplasia, dysplasia grade 1, dysplasia grade 2 or near cancer dysplasia.
randomized controlled trial	Diagnoses of cancer were based on the cytology findings plus available histologic, radiologic and clinical materials.
randomized controlled trial	At the end of the study there was little overall difference in cumulative risk of esophageal cancer between those receiving vitamin/mineral supplementation and those receiving placebo.
randomized controlled trial	There was, however, a significant increase in reversion to non-dysplastic cytology among the group receiving the active treatment. The odds of not having any dysplasia at the two post-randomization screens was 1.
randomized controlled trial	23 times higher in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. Within each treatment group higher categories of dysplasia were associated with higher rates of cancer.
randomized controlled trial	The effect of vitamin and mineral supplementation on esophageal cytology: results from the Linxian Dysplasia Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background & aims: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
randomized controlled trial	Squamous dysplasia, the accepted histological precursor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, represents a potentially modifiable intermediate end point for chemoprevention trials in high-risk populations.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of selenomethionine 200 microg daily and/or celecoxib 200 mg twice daily (2 x 2 factorial design) among residents of Linxian, People's Republic of China.
randomized controlled trial	Subjects had histologically confirmed mild or moderate esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed before and after a 10-month intervention.
randomized controlled trial	Per-subject change (regression, stable, or progression) in the worst dysplasia grade was defined as the primary end point. Results were compared by agent group (selenomethionine vs placebo; celecoxib vs placebo).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Two hundred sixty-seven subjects fulfilled all eligibility criteria, and 238 (89%) completed the trial.
randomized controlled trial	Overall, selenomethionine resulted in a trend toward increased dysplasia regression (43% vs 32%) and decreased dysplasia progression (14% vs 19%) compared with no selenomethionine (P =. 08).
randomized controlled trial	In unplanned stratified analyses, selenomethionine favorably affected a change in dysplasia grade among 115 subjects with mild esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline (P =.
randomized controlled trial	02), but not among 123 subjects with moderate esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline (P = 1. 00). Celecoxib status did not influence changes in dysplasia grade overall (P =. 78) or by baseline histology subgroup.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: After a 10-month intervention, neither selenomethionine nor celecoxib inhibited esophageal squamous carcinogenesis for all high-risk subjects.
randomized controlled trial	However, among subjects with mild esophageal squamous dysplasia at baseline, selenomethionine did have a protective effect.
randomized controlled trial	Although it is based on unplanned stratified analyses, this finding is the first report of a possible beneficial effect for any candidate esophageal squamous cell carcinoma chemopreventive agent in a randomized controlled trial.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized, placebo-controlled, esophageal squamous cell cancer chemoprevention trial of selenomethionine and celecoxib
Case-control study	Background: In rodents, zinc deficiency potentiates the effects of certain nitrosamines that act as esophageal carcinogens.
Case-control study	Studies of the association between zinc and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in humans have been hampered by plasma zinc homeostasis, which obscures individual differences in total zinc stores, and by the uncertainty regarding zinc bioavailability when estimating dietary zinc intake because phytate from whole grains effectively prohibits zinc absorption.
Case-control study	By using baseline tissue biopsy specimens collected in a prospective observational study, we determined the association between incident esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and baseline element concentrations in tissue sections from residents of Linzhou, China, participating in a nutrition intervention trial.
Case-control study	Methods: We used x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to measure zinc, copper, iron, nickel, and sulfur concentrations in single 5-microm-thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal biopsy specimens collected in 1985 from 60 eventual case and 72 control subjects.
Case-control study	Subjects were matched on baseline histology and followed for 16 years.
Case-control study	We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between each element and risk of incident esophageal cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Case-control study	Results: The risk of developing esophageal cancer was much lower for subjects in the highest quartile of esophageal tissue zinc concentration compared with those in the lowest quartile (HR = 0. 21, 95% CI = 0. 065 to 0. 68).
Case-control study	The association was statistically significant across quartiles (P(trend) =. 015). Individuals in the highest quartile of sulfur concentration had a lower risk of esophageal cancer than individuals in the lowest quartile (HR = 0. 29, 95% CI = 0.
Case-control study	095 to 0. 85), but the association across quartiles was not statistically significant (P(trend) =. 081). There was no association between copper, iron, or nickel concentrations and risk of esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	Conclusion: High tissue zinc concentration was strongly associated with a reduced risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Case-control study	X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to assess relationships among concentrations of both nutritional and toxic elements and disease risk in banked tissue specimens.
Case-control study	Zinc concentration in esophageal biopsy specimens measured by x-ray fluorescence and esophageal cancer risk
meta analysis	Background & aims: Increasing evidence suggests that a low folate intake and impaired folate metabolism may be implicated in the development of gastrointestinal cancers.
meta analysis	We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association of folate intake or genetic polymorphisms in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a central enzyme in folate metabolism, with risk of esophageal, gastric, or pancreatic cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE for studies published through March 2006. Study-specific relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variance to obtain random-effects summary estimates.
meta analysis	Results: The summary relative risks for the highest versus the lowest category of dietary folate intake were 0. 66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 53-0. 83) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (4 case-control), 0. 50 (95% CI, 0. 39-0.
meta analysis	65) for esophageal adenocarcinoma (3 case-control), and 0. 49 (95% CI, 0. 35-0. 67) for pancreatic cancer (1 case-control, 4 cohort); there was no heterogeneity among studies.
meta analysis	Results on dietary folate intake and risk of gastric cancer (9 case-control, 2 cohort) were inconsistent.
meta analysis	In most studies, the MTHFR 677TT (variant) genotype, which is associated with reduced enzyme activity, was associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, noncardia gastric cancer, gastric cancer (all subsites), and pancreatic cancer; all but one of 22 odds ratios were >1, of which 13 estimates were statistically significant.
meta analysis	Studies of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism were limited and inconsistent. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that folate may play a role in carcinogenesis of the esophagus, stomach, and pancreas.
meta analysis	Folate intake, MTHFR polymorphisms, and risk of esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer: a meta-analysis
Cohort study	Background: Nutrients in the one-carbon metabolism pathway may be involved in carcinogenesis. Few cohort studies have investigated the intakes of folate and related nutrients in relation to gastric and esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	Methods: We prospectively examined the association between self-reported intakes of folate, methionine, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 and gastric and esophageal cancer in 492,293 men and women.
Cohort study	Results: We observed an elevated risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with low intake of folate (relative risk (95% confidence interval): Q1 vs Q3, 1. 91 (1. 17, 3. 10)), but no association with high intake.
Cohort study	Folate intake was not associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, or non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma. The intakes of methionine, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 were not associated with esophageal and gastric cancer.
Cohort study	Conclusion: Low intake of folate was associated with increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Cohort study	Intakes of folate, methionine, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 with risk of esophageal and gastric cancer in a large cohort study
meta analysis	Quantification of the association between the intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is controversial even though several studies have explored this association.
meta analysis	We summarized the evidence from observational studies in categorical, linear and non-linear dose-response meta-analyses.
meta analysis	Eligible studies published up to 31 July 2012 were retrieved via computer searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as manual review of references.
meta analysis	Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks (SRRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 32 studies involving 10,037 cases of ESCC were included in this meta-analysis. The SRRs for the highest vs.
meta analysis	lowest intake were 0. 56 (95% CI: 0. 45-0. 69) for vegetable intake and 0. 53 (95% CI: 0. 44-0. 64) for fruit intake (pheterogeneity <0. 001 for both). Similar results were observed in a linear dose-response analysis.
meta analysis	There was evidence of non-linear associations for intakes of fruit (pnon-linearity <0. 001) and vegetables (pnon-linearity =0. 041). There was no evidence of publication bias.
meta analysis	These data support the hypothesis that intakes of vegetables and fruit may significantly reduce the risk of ESCC. Further investigation with prospective designs, validated questionnaires and good control of important confounders is warranted.
meta analysis	Intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis of observational studies
Cohort study	Objective: To determine more precise and accurate cancer risk estimates for achalasia that could be used to plan surveillance. Design: Cohort. Setting: Swedish population.
Cohort study	Participants: All patients with achalasia listed in the population-based Swedish Inpatient Register from 1964 through 1989.
Cohort study	Main outcome measures: The observed number of cancers in the cohort was compared with expected numbers of cancers (standardized incidence ratio [SIR]) for each 5-year age group and calendar year of observation, calculated using data from the Swedish Cancer Registry.
Cohort study	Results: A total of 1062 patients with achalasia accumulated 9864 years of follow-up. The mean age at entry was 57. 2 years, and the mean age at cancer diagnosis was 71. 0 years. Esophageal cancer occurred in 24 patients.
Cohort study	The risk of esophageal cancer in the first year after achalasia diagnosis was extremely high (SIR, 126. 3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 63. 0 to 226.
Cohort study	1) as a consequence of prevalent cancers leading to distal esophageal obstruction simulating achalasia. During years 1 to 24, the risk was increased more than 16-fold (SIR, 16. 6; 95% CI, 8. 8 to 28. 3).
Cohort study	Annual surveillance after the first year would require 406 endoscopic examinations in men and 2220 in women to detect one cancer. Conclusions: Patients with achalasia are at markedly increased risk of developing esophageal cancer.
Cohort study	A substantial number of surveillance examinations might be required to screen for cancers, especially in women. It is not known whether surveillance will result in improved survival.

Case series	Clinical material and the results of treatment of 63 esophageal lye corrosion carcinoma patients are presented below. The mean age of patients at lye ingestion was 6.
Case series	2 years; the mean latent time between lye corrosion and esophageal carcinoma was 41 years. The later the lye was ingested the earlier carcinoma of the esophagus appeared.
Case series	Eighty-four percent of carcinomas(all of which were of histologically squamous cell type) were found to be in the bronchial bifurcation area of the esophagus.
Case series	Sixty-eight percent of lye corrosion carcinoma patients had been treated with resection or radiotherapy (over 4000 rads). Every tenth patient of whole material had surveved for over seven years.
Case series	Both surgery and radiotherapy as practiced in our clinics had better survival rates than for previous esophageal carcinoma series.
Case series	Lye corrosion carcinoma of the esophagus: a review of 63 cases
Case series	Twelve patients (10. 4%) had a history of partial gastrectomy among the 115 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	The clinical characteristics, nutritional parameters, and incidences of esophagitis of the resected specimens were investigated between 11 patients with esophageal carcinoma who had partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer diseases (Group A) and 103 patients with esophageal carcinoma without any previous history of gastrectomy (Group B).
Case series	Age, sex, tumor location, clinical stages, and cigarette and alcohol consumption were not different between the two groups. Hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin level in Group A were lower than those in Group B (p < 0.
Case series	05). Serum zinc level in Group A was lower than that in Group B, but this difference was not significant. There was no difference in the incidences of esophagitis between the two groups.
Case series	In conclusion, there is an association between partial gastrectomy and later development of squamous esophageal carcinoma. The role of malnutritional factors and gastroesophageal reflux, however, remain unclear.
Case series	The long-term follow-up of patients after partial gastrectomy is warranted.
Case series	Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus after partial gastrectomy
Case series	Background: The cause of the rapid increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus since the 1970s is unknown.
Case series	Objective: To test the hypothesis that duodenogastroesophageal reflux causes adenocarcinoma of the esophagus by comparing the frequency of gastric surgery (a human model of duodenogastroesophageal reflux) and other potential risk factors between patients with adenocarcinoma and patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Methods: Medical records of all patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 1987 and 1994 were reviewed.
Case series	The following data were retrieved: age, gender, race, tumor location, history of gastric surgery and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, and use of tobacco, alcohol, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors.
Case series	Results: The data of 325 patients with adenocarcinoma (73. 5%) and 117 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (26. 5%) were analyzed. No differences were found between the groups in age, proportion with gastric surgery (patients with adenocarcinoma: 1.
Case series	2%, 95% confidence interval 0. 3-3. 1%; patients with squamous cell carcinoma: 0. 9%, 95% confidence interval 0. 0-4. 7%), smoking (76. 7 vs 81. 6%), or alcohol use (71. 8 vs 79. 1%).
Case series	Significant risk factors associated with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were male gender, white race, distal cancer location, and Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Conclusions: Previous gastric surgery is rarely found in patients with esophageal cancer and is performed with equal frequency in patients with adenocarcinoma and those with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	This suggests that gastric surgery and its associated duodenogastroesophageal reflux do not play a role in the etiology and rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	White males in their mid-60s with Barrett's esophagus who smoke and drink alcohol are at highest risk for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	The lack of association between adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric surgery: a retrospective study
meta analysis	Background: Several studies have reported an association between gastric atrophy and upper gastrointestinal cancers.
meta analysis	Our aim was to summarise the available information and calculate the relative risks (RRs) associated with gastric atrophy for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Methods: We searched the PubMed and ISI-Web of Science databases, as well as the reference lists of the relevant articles.
meta analysis	Summary RRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using random-effects models for the association between gastric atrophy, defined histologically or by serum pepsinogen markers, and OSCC, OAC, and GCA.
meta analysis	Results: Eighteen articles were included in the meta-analysis; 13, 7, and 3 studies reported on GCA, OSCC, and OAC, respectively. The overall RRs (95% CI) for the three cancer types were: GCA, 2. 89 (2. 09-3. 98); OSCC, 1. 94 (1. 48-2. 55); OAC, 0.
meta analysis	51 (0. 19-1. 37). Several subgroup analyses showed the robustness of the results. In the majority of the analyses, there was low to moderate heterogeneity.
meta analysis	Conclusions: This study found two- to threefold increased risk of OSCC and GCA but a possible reduced risk of OAC in people with gastric atrophy.
meta analysis	Further studies are needed to establish the association with OAC and causal association with OSCC, and mechanisms of the increased risk need to be investigated for GCA.
meta analysis	Gastric atrophy and risk of oesophageal cancer and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma--a systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection might be one of the potential risk factors for oesophageal cancer. However, the previous epidemiological findings were heterogeneous.
meta analysis	Aim: To explore the association between HPV infection and oesophageal cancer risk by means of meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Methods: Studies on HPV infection and oesophageal cancer were identified, the prevalence of HPV infection and its association with oesophageal cancer risk were quantitatively summarised by meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Results: A total of 8990 oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients and 174 oesophageal adenocarcinomas patients were evaluated from 76 included studies. Summarised HPV prevalence in oesophageal SCC was 22.
meta analysis	2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 18. 3-26. 7%], HPV-16 was the most frequently observed subtype with a summarised prevalence of 11. 4% (95% CI: 8. 2-15. 7%). With respect to oesophageal adenocarcinoma, HPV prevalence was 35. 0% (95% CI, 13. 2-65.
meta analysis	7%) and HPV-16 prevalence was 11. 4% (95% CI: 8. 2-15. 7%). Due to the limited number of included studies on oesophageal adenocarcinoma, association analyses were performed to oesophageal SCC only.
meta analysis	Significant association was observed between HPV infection and oesophageal SCC with a summarised odds ratio of 3. 32 (95% CI, 2. 26-4. 87). According to HPV-16, the strength of the association was found to be 3. 52 (95% CI, 2. 04-6. 07).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Human papillomavirus infection was observed to be associated with an increased risk of oesophageal SCC in this meta-analysis.
meta analysis	However, due to the evident heterogeneity observed between the included studies and the strength of the association not as strong as observed for cervical cancer and laryngeal cancer, further studies are needed to clarify the relation and its underlying mechanisms.
meta analysis	Systematic review with meta-analysis: the association between human papillomavirus infection and oesophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) has been hypothesised as a risk factor for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but aetiological research has been limited by the varying methodology used for establishing HPV prevalence.
meta analysis	The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the prevalence of HPV DNA detected in OSCC tumours and the influence of study characteristics.
meta analysis	Methods: Study-level estimates of overall and type-specific HPV prevalence were meta-analysed to obtain random-effects summary estimates. Results: This analysis included 124 studies with a total of 13 832 OSCC cases.
meta analysis	The average HPV prevalence (95% confidence interval) among OSCC cases was 0. 277 (0. 234, 0. 320) by polymerase chain reaction; 0. 243 (0. 159, 0. 326) by in situ hybridisation; 0. 304 (0. 185, 0. 423) by immunohistochemistry; 0. 322 (0. 154, 0.
meta analysis	490) by L1 serology; and 0. 176 (0. 061, 0. 292) by Southern/slot/dot blot. The highest HPV prevalence was found in Africa and Asia, notably among Chinese studies from provinces with high OSCC incidence rates.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Future research should focus on quantifying HPV in OSCC cases using strict quality control measures, as well as determining the association between HPV and OSCC incidence by conducting large, population-based case-control studies.
meta analysis	Such studies will provide a richer understanding of the role of HPV in OSCC aetiology.
meta analysis	Prevalence of human papillomavirus among oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases: systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Objective: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers among humans. The role of HPV as one of the etiological agents in esophageal carcinogenesis is partially unknown.
meta analysis	We assessed whether the available evidence supports the association of HPV with risk and prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs).
meta analysis	Design: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS were searched up to February 2021.
meta analysis	The included studies were prospective or retrospective studies that evaluated the incidence, risk, and prognosis of HPV-16/18-related ESCCs in adult subjects. The primary outcome was the incidence rate of ESCC in HPV-16/18 carriers.
meta analysis	Secondary outcomes included the risk of ESCCs compared with healthy HPV-16/18 carriers (expressed as odds ratios [ORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) and the survival of HPV + versus HPV- ESCCs.
meta analysis	Results: The search identified 1649 unique citations, of which 145 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the pooled analysis (16,484 patients). The pooled HPV prevalence in ESCCs was 18. 2% (95% CI 15. 2-21. 6%; P < 0. 001).
meta analysis	A significantly increased ESCC risk was associated with HPV infection (OR = 3. 81; 95% CI 2. 84-5. 11; P < 0. 001).
meta analysis	Main limitation were methods of HPV detection (DNA only), race of populations included (mainly Asiatic countries) and lack of adjustment for other prognostic factors.
meta analysis	Conclusions: The findings suggest that HPV-16/18 is detectable in about 1 on 5 cases of ESCC with different prevalences across the world. It is moderately but significantly associated with a diagnosis of ESCC.
meta analysis	Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm and increase the current knowledge of the subject.
meta analysis	Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 infection and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Case series	Objectives: To determine linkage in a pedigree with palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Design: A large American pedigree was studied and the clinical phenotype was described.
Case series	Linkage analysis was performed using genomic DNA from key individuals. Setting: A community-based family study. Patients: The family pedigree was expanded from a single index case.
Case series	Main outcome measures: To demonstrate linkage and the relative risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in this pedigree.
Case series	Results: Focal PPK was inherited as an autosomal dominant with variable expression, but signs were not limited to the palmoplantar epidermis.
Case series	The generalized nature of this pattern of PPK was highlighted by the perifollicular papules and oral hyperkeratosis. Affected individuals (125 individuals) in 7 generations were identified, with 17 affected individuals having associated cancer.
Case series	Seven of the 8 squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus occurred in smokers. Other tumors were seen in nonsmokers, but these were not significantly increased.
Case series	The combined male-female expected incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth and esophagus was 0. 21; observed, 8 (relative risk of 38; P <. 001).
Case series	Linkage to the tylosis and esophageal cancer gene locus on 17q24 was demonstrated with a maximum 2-point lod score of 8. 20 at zero recombination fraction for the DNA marker D17S1603.
Case series	Conclusion: The distinctive clinical phenotype in this family suggests a new classification for PPKs, in particular a reappraisal of the phenotype as a focal PPK. A very similar phenotype is found in patients with keratin K16 gene mutations.
Case series	Linkage of an American pedigree with palmoplantar keratoderma and malignancy (palmoplantar ectodermal dysplasia type III) to 17q24. Literature survey and proposed updated classification of the keratodermas
Case series	Background & aims: Tumor-suppressor genes found in inherited cancer predisposition syndromes are also responsible for sporadic cancers of the same type.
Case series	Recently, the tylosis oesophageal cancer (TOC) gene locus has been mapped to 17q25 by linkage analyses of pedigrees with focal nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma associated with a high risk of esophageal cancer development.
Case series	The aim of this study was to clarify whether the TOC locus is affected in sporadic esophageal cancers.
Case series	Methods: We investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 17q in 58 sporadic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCs) using 20 microsatellite markers focusing on the TOC locus.
Case series	Results: LOH on 17q was observed in 37 of 52 (71%) informative cases at one or more loci, 80% (33/37) of which included the TOC locus. The smallest common deleted region was at D17S1839 within the TOC locus.
Case series	Conclusions: The constructed deletion map revealed that the TOC locus is commonly deleted in sporadic ESCs, suggesting that a tumor-suppressor gene responsible for ESC is contained within this locus.
Case series	Tylosis esophageal cancer locus on chromosome 17q25.1 is commonly deleted in sporadic human esophageal cancer
Case-control study	Tylosis esophageal cancer (TOC) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, oral precursor lesions, and a high lifetime risk of esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	We have previously localized the TOC locus to a small genomic interval within chromosomal region 17q25. Using a targeted capture array and next-generation sequencing, we have now identified missense mutations (c. 557T>C [p. Ile186Thr] and c.
Case-control study	566C>T [p. Pro189Leu] in RHBDF2, which encodes the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (also known as iRhom2), as the underlying cause of TOC.
Case-control study	We show that the distribution of RHBDF2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor.
Case-control study	It would thus appear that EGFR signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. Furthermore, we also show an altered localization of RHBDF2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors.
Case-control study	The elucidation of a role of RHBDF2 in growth-factor signaling in esophageal cancer will help to determine whether targeting this pathway in chemotherapy for this and other squamous cell carcinomas will be effective.
Case-control study	RHBDF2 mutations are associated with tylosis, a familial esophageal cancer syndrome
Case series	Ingestion of alendronate sodium (Fosamax) by osteoporotic patients can be associated with esophagitis and esophageal ulcer.
Case series	Alendronate can damage the esophagus both by toxicity from the medication itself and by nonspecific irritation secondary to contact between the pill and the esophageal mucosa, similar to other cases of "pill esophagitis.
Case series	" Despite its wide use, the histologic appearances of alendronate-associated esophageal ulceration have not been previously described in detail, nor is this type of medication-induced injury commonly appreciated by pathologists when evaluating biopsies from ulcer sites.
Case series	We report a series of 10 patients who experienced erosive/ulcerative esophagitis while ingesting alendronate, and describe the associated endoscopic and pathologic features.
Case series	Biopsies from all patients showed inflammatory exudate and inflamed granulation tissue as characteristic of any ulcer site. Polarizable crystalline foreign material was present in six of 10 biopsies (60%).
Case series	Multinucleated giant cells within the inflammatory exudate were present near this crystalline foreign material in three of 10 biopsies (30%).
Case series	Adjacent squamous epithelium typically showed active inflammation and a reactive appearance with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei. Multinucleated squamous epithelial giant cells were present in two of 10 cases (20%).
Case series	Microorganisms were unusual; scattered fungi and/or viral inclusions were present in only two of 10 biopsies (20%).

review	Cancer of the oesophagus has great diversity in geographical distribution and incidence. The rate of oesophageal cancer has been increasing in some areas and the reasons for this are not clear.
review	This review outlines fascinating epidemiological aspects and the risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.
review	While in the Western world the effects of alcohol and tobacco are substantial preconditions, worldwide other factors, such as diet, nutritional deficiencies, environmental exposure and infectious agents (especially papillomavirus and fungi), play a significant role.
review	Chronic irritation of the oesophagus appears to participate in the process of carcinogenesis, particularly in patients with thermal and/or mechanical injury, achalasia, oesophageal diverticulum, chronic lye stricture, radiation therapy, injection sclerotherapy and gastric resection before the appearance of oesophageal tumour.
review	The association of Plummer-Vinson syndrome, coeliac disease, tylosis and scleroderma with oesophageal cancer has also been reviewed.

Cross-sectional study	The development of second malignant tumors (SMTs), in patients who have had their first tumor treated successfully, represents a serious limitation of current therapeutic strategies for head and neck cancers.
Cross-sectional study	To improve our understanding of the current magnitude of the problem and the various factors that might influence its importance, we reviewed the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's (RTOG) prospectively collected registry of all head and neck patients seen in participating member institutions between February 1977 and April 1980.
Cross-sectional study	A total of 928 patients were identified who had squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region, no prior or coincident history of another malignant tumor, and whose planned treatment consisted of radiation therapy only.
Cross-sectional study	A total of 110 second, independent, malignant tumors occurred in these patients. Overall, the estimated risk of developing a second tumor within 3 years of radiotherapy was 10%, within 5 years 15%, and within 8 years 23%.
Cross-sectional study	Minor differences in frequency were observed for different primary sites. These SMTs unquestionably influenced subsequent survival adversely.
Cross-sectional study	Analysis of the database also revealed that the extent of the primary tumor influenced the risk of a second; most occurred in patients who presented with the smallest primary tumors because of their better survival.
Cross-sectional study	Our data indicate that preventive medicine should have its greatest impact in those patients who are treated for an early stage primary tumor.
Cross-sectional study	Second malignancies in patients who have head and neck cancer: incidence, effect on survival and implications based on the RTOG experience
Cohort study	Purpose: The present study presents the experience at the University of Florida with synchronous and metachronous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites.
Cohort study	Patients and methods: This study included 1,112 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottic larynx treated with radiation therapy with curative intent from 1964 to 1997.
Cohort study	All patients had follow-up for at least 2 years. No patients were lost to follow-up.
Cohort study	Results: The overall survival rate was 45% and the disease-specific survival rate was 67% at 5 years after initial diagnosis of carcinoma of the head and neck mucosal sites.
Cohort study	Seventy-seven patients (7%) presented with synchronous carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites and 103 patients (9%) developed metachronous carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites at 0. 6 to 21. 7 years (median, 3. 6 years).
Cohort study	The overall survival rate was 31%, and the disease-specific survival rate was 50% at 5 years after metachronous carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites. Seven patients (1%) developed metachronous carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus at 1 to 11.
Cohort study	1 years (median, 2. 8 years), 15 patients (1%) presented with synchronous carcinomas of the lung, and 83 patients (7%) developed metachronous carcinomas of the lung at 0. 6 to 17. 6 years (median, 3. 5 years).
Cohort study	Conclusion: Development of synchronous and metachronous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites are in part responsible for failure to improve overall survival rates for patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck mucosal sites, justifying rigorous follow-up and studies on chemoprevention.

Case series	The poor prognosis for esophageal cancer could be improved if lesions were detected at an early stage.
Case series	To detect early esophageal cancer, endoscopic screening of the esophagus with the Lugol dye method was performed in patients with head and neck cancers who were asymptomatic but regarded as being at high risk for synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer.
Case series	Of 178 patients screened, 9 had esophageal cancer (5. 1%). Eight of these patients (89%) were at early stages with no lymph node metastasis. Most of the lesions (9 of 13 lesions) were not detectable by barium studies or ordinary endoscopic study.
Case series	The epidemiologic statistical analysis of the patients confirmed that they had a significantly high observed and expected number (O/E) ratio (39. 7; P less than 0. 001).
Case series	These results demonstrate the value of endoscopic screening of the esophagus with the Lugol dye method in patients with head and neck cancers and imply that endoscopic screening with the Lugol dye method may be useful for detecting early esophageal cancer in individuals at risk for other causes.
Case series	Endoscopic screening of early esophageal cancer with the Lugol dye method in patients with head and neck cancers
Case series	Background: Head and neck cancer (HNC) has a high incidence in Brazil, with cancer of the oral cavity being one of the five most common cancers among Brazilians.
Case series	Alcohol and tobacco consumption may contribute to synchronous or metachronous HNC and esophageal cancer.
Case series	The early detection of superficial esophageal cancer and dysplasia in asymptomatic patients with HNC, after successfully treating the primary cancer, may provide an effective cure.
Case series	Methods: A prospective study involving 60 patients with HNC was carried out at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) to screen for superficial esophageal cancer and dysplasia using endoscopy and a 2% lugol dye solution followed by biopsy of the suspicious areas.
Case series	Results: Five patients (8. 3%) had superficial esophageal cancer, which was diagnosed as intraepithelial carcinoma in three of them (5. 0%). In four patients, the superficial esophageal cancer was synchronous, and in one it was metachronous to HNC.
Case series	Five patients (8. 3%) had dysplasias in the esophageal epithelium (three were classified as mild and two as moderate).
Case series	Conclusion: These results demonstrate the value of endoscopic screening of the esophagus using lugol dye in patients with HNC, particularly because superficial esophageal cancer is extremely difficult to detect by conventional methods in asymptomatic patients.
Case series	Diagnosis of superficial esophageal cancer and dysplasia using endoscopic screening with a 2% lugol dye solution in patients with head and neck cancer
Case series	Background: An attempt was made to improve metachronous oesophageal cancer prognosis through bi-annual systematic esophageal endoscopy screening in patients treated for head and neck cancer.
Case series	Patients and methods: Bi-annual esophageal endoscopy, without a staining procedure, was performed in 1560 patients from 1987 to 1997.
Case series	The distribution of previous head and neck cancer was oral cavity (20%), oropharynx (30%), hypopharynx (34%), and larynx (16%). All patients had initial panendoscopic inspection before HNSCC treatment.
Case series	Esophageal tumors were considered to be second synchronous primaries when discovered within the first six months of initial tumor diagnosis.
Case series	Results: Fifty metachronous esophageal asymptomatic cancers (42 T1 and 7 in situ carcinomas) were diagnosed by endoscopy. The median time between the HNC and the esophageal carcinoma was 43 months (7-137 months).
Case series	Metachronous esophageal carcinoma was discovered in 2. 6% of patients with oral cavity tumor, 5. 7% of patients with oropharynx tumor, 2. 3% of patients with hypopharynx tumor, and 1. 7% of patients with larynx tumor. Causes of death were: 41.
Case series	1% related to esophageal tumor with tumor progression, metastatic evolution, or treatment toxicity; 28. 9% related to non malignant causes; 26. 6% related to a cancer that was not of esophageal origin.
Case series	Conclusions: Over a 10-year period, systematic bi-annual esophageal endoscopy uncovered metachronous esophageal tumors in 3. 2% of 1560 patients originally treated for head and neck carcinoma, developing in a median time of 47 months.
Case series	Patients with initial oropharyngeal tumors had a significantly higher risk of metachronous esophageal SCC, compared to the other tumor sites (P < 0. 02 with Fisher exact test).
Case series	Given the elevated death rate not related to the esophageal cancer and the median survival of 16 months, any potential benefit from this time-consuming procedure is debatable.
Case series	Systematic esophageal endoscopy screening in patients previously treated for head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma
Case series	Background: Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck have a high prevalence of second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
Case series	This study assessed the risk of developing second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck based on multiplicity of Lugol-voiding lesions observed by chromoendoscopy and patient characteristics.
Case series	Methods: Three hundred eighty-nine patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were divided into 4 groups: no Lugol-voiding lesions; several (</=10) small Lugol-voiding lesions; many (>10) small Lugol-voiding lesions; and many irregularly shaped, multiform Lugol-voiding lesions.
Case series	Relative risk for the development of synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas was investigated by using univariate and multivariate analysis.
Case series	Metachronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas was also studied among 227 patients followed more than 1 year after initial examination.
Case series	Results: Fifty-four (14%) of the 389 patients were found to have synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
Case series	In particular, 55% of the patients with many irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions had synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
Case series	Univariate analysis showed that the presence of many irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions, drinking habit, male gender, and smoking were significant risk factors for the development of synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
Case series	Multivariate analysis also revealed that many irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions (odds ratio: 21. 4; p < 0. 001) and drinking habit (odds ratio: 3. 3; p < 0. 02) were independent risk factors.
Case series	During follow-up, 7 patients (3%) had metachronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas; 6 had many irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions and the seventh had many small Lugol-voiding lesions in the background mucosa.
Case series	Conclusions: The presence of numerous irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions was closely associated with second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
Case series	This might be explained by the concept of "field cancerization. " Ingestion of alcohol may play an important role in the occurrence of this phenomenon.
Case series	Association of multiple Lugol-voiding lesions with synchronous and metachronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in patients with head and neck cancer
Case series	We have reviewed the records of 1,982 patients who were treated for head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer from 1962 to 1986. Forty-one patients had primary cancer at both sites.
Case series	Twenty-one cases of these multiple primaries occurred synchronously and twenty were metachronous. The overall incidence of esophageal cancer in our head- and neck-cancer patients was 2.
Case series	5 per cent and the incidence of head and neck cancer in our esophageal cancer patients was 7. 1 per cent.
Case series	From 1980 to 1986, 574 cases with a diagnosis of head and neck or esophageal cancer were routinely screened for other aerodigestive malignancies at the time of initial diagnosis.
Case series	From this group, only six patients had simultaneous lesions of the head and neck and esophagus with only one asymptomatic esophageal carcinoma. Median survival of all 41 multiple primary patients after diagnosis of esophageal cancer was 5. 3 months.
Case series	Two- and three-year survivals were 6. 7 per cent and 0 per cent, respectively. There was no significant survival difference for lesions diagnosed simultaneously, synchronously, and metachronously before 1980 or after 1980.
Case series	All patients died with uncontrolled esophageal cancer except for one patient who died of head- and neck-cancer recurrence.
Case series	Our experience indicates that active screening of head- and neck-cancer patients for simultaneous esophageal cancer has a low yield and there appears to be no survival advantage for these patients compared with those with subsequently diagnosed esophageal tumors.
Case series	Impact of esophageal screening in patients with head and neck cancer
Case series	Background: Male patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer are known to have high risk of concomitant esophageal cancer developing.
Case series	Thus, mass screening programs are pursued to detect such esophageal cancer early, and in a mass screening trial of patients with early oral and oropharyngeal cancer, the efficacy of Lugol dye endoscopy for detecting concomitant esophageal cancers has been evaluated.
Case series	Methods: Lugol dye was used in an endoscopic screening of 101 patients with oral cancer and 26 with oropharyngeal cancer; all of the patients were men. Results: Among these 127 patients, eight (6.
Case series	3%) clinical asymptomatic concomitant esophageal cancers were detected, and four of these eight cancers were found in the patients with oropharyngeal cancer.
Case series	Five of these eight superficial lesions could not be detected by ordinary endoscopy or barium study.
Case series	Conclusion: Our results show that Lugol dye endoscopy is indispensable for monitoring male patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer to detect an early concomitant esophageal cancer.
Case series	In addition, a higher frequency of concomitant esophageal cancer was seen in the patients with oropharyngeal cancer than in the patients with oral cancer.

Case-control study	Background: Several studies have suggested an association between poor oral health and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Case-control study	We conducted a case-control study in Kashmir, a region with relatively high incidence of ESCC in north India, to investigate the association between oral hygiene and ESCC risk.
Case-control study	Methods: We recruited 703 histologically confirmed ESCC cases, and 1664 controls individually matched to the cases for age, sex, and district of residence.
Case-control study	Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We found an inverse association between teeth cleaning and ESCC risk.
Case-control study	As compared with never cleaning teeth, the OR (95% CI) was 0. 41 (0. 28-0. 62) for cleaning less than daily and 0. 44 (0. 25-0. 77) for cleaning at least once a day (P for trend=0.
Case-control study	026) in models adjusted for multiple potential confounders, including several indicators of socioeconomic status. This association persisted after we limited our analyses to never tobacco users.
Case-control study	The inverse association between cleaning teeth and ESCC was stronger with using brushes than with using sticks/fingers.
Case-control study	We also found an association between the number of decayed, filled, and missing teeth and ESCC risk, but the trend of the associations was not statistically significant.
Case-control study	Avoiding solid food and cold beverages because of teeth and oral problems were also associated with ESCC risk.
Case-control study	Conclusion: We found an association between poor oral hygiene indicators and ESCC risk, supporting the previous studies that showed the same associations.
Case-control study	Poor oral hygiene and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Kashmir
Cohort study	Background: Tooth loss has previously been associated with a higher risk of cancer, heart disease, and stroke, but the role of confounding by smoking remains an issue.
Cohort study	Methods: We conducted a cohort study including 29,584 healthy, rural Chinese adults who were participants in a chemoprevention trial from 1986 through 1991 and who have been followed-up through 2001.
Cohort study	We categorized tooth loss for each subject as less than or equal to or greater than the median number of teeth lost for other subjects of the same age at baseline.
Cohort study	Mortality outcomes were categorized as follows: total death (n = 9362), upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer death (n = 2625), other cancer death (n = 514), heart disease death (n = 1932), and fatal stroke (n = 2866).
Cohort study	Results: Individuals with greater than the age-specific median number of teeth lost had statistically significant 13% increased risk of total death [95% confidence interval (CI) 9-18%], 35% increased risk of upper GI cancer death (95% CI 14-59%), 28% increased risk of heart disease death (95% CI 17-40%), and 12% increased risk of stroke death (95% CI 2-23%), but no significantly increased risk of death from cancer at other sites.
Cohort study	These elevated risks were present in male smokers, male non-smokers, and females, nearly all never-smokers.
Cohort study	Conclusions: In this Asian population, tooth loss significantly increased the risk of total death and death from upper GI cancer, heart disease, and stroke. These associations were not limited to tobacco smokers.
Cohort study	Tooth loss is associated with increased risk of total death and death from upper gastrointestinal cancer, heart disease, and stroke in a Chinese population-based cohort
Case-control study	We tested the association between tooth loss and oral hygiene and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in people living in a high-risk area of Iran.
Case-control study	We used a case-control study of pathologically confirmed ESCC cases (n = 283) and controls (n = 560) matched on sex, age, and neighborhood.
Case-control study	Subjects with ESCC had significantly more decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) with a median (interquartile range) of 31 (23-32) compared with controls 28 (16-32; P = 0. 0045).
Case-control study	Subjects with ESCC were significantly more likely than controls to fail to practice regular oral hygiene (78% versus 58%).
Case-control study	In multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression models, having 32 DMFT compared with < or = 15 conferred an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2. 10 (1. 19-3. 70).
Case-control study	Compared with daily tooth brushing, practicing no regular oral hygiene conferred an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2. 37 (1. 42-3. 97). Restricting the analysis to subjects that had never smoked tobacco did not materially alter these results.
Case-control study	We found significant associations between two markers of poor oral hygiene, a larger number of DMFT and lack of daily tooth brushing, and risk of ESCC in a population at high risk for ESCC where many cases occur in never smokers.
Case-control study	Our results are consistent with several previous analyses in other high-risk populations.
Case-control study	Tooth loss and lack of regular oral hygiene are associated with higher risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case-control study	Poor oral health has been reported as a risk factor in the etiology of head and neck cancer.
Case-control study	Data on oral health were ascertained as part of two multicenter case-control studies comprising 924 cases and 928 controls in central Europe and 2,286 cases and 1,824 controls in Latin America.
Case-control study	Incident cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx) and esophagus, as well as age (in quinquennia)- and sex frequency-matched controls, were enrolled from 1998 to 2003.
Case-control study	Poor condition of the mouth (central Europe: odds ratio (OR) = 2. 89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1. 74, 4. 81; Latin America: OR = 1. 89, 95% CI: 1. 47, 2. 42), lack of toothbrush use (Latin America: OR = 2. 36, 95% CI: 1. 28, 4.
Case-control study	36), and daily mouthwash use (Latin America: OR = 3. 40, 95% CI: 1. 96, 5. 89) emerged as risk factors for head and neck cancer, independent of tobacco use and alcohol consumption.
Case-control study	Missing between six and 15 teeth was an independent risk factor for esophageal cancer (central Europe: OR = 2. 84, 95% CI: 1. 26, 6. 41; Latin America: OR = 2. 18, 95% CI: 1. 04, 4. 59).
Case-control study	These results indicate that periodontal disease (as indicated by poor condition of the mouth and missing teeth) and daily mouthwash use may be independent causes of cancers of the head, neck, and esophagus.
Case-control study	Oral health and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and esophagus: results of two multicentric case-control studies
Case-control study	Background: Tooth loss has been associated with a higher risk of several types of cancer.
Case-control study	To clarify the significance of tooth loss to the risk of 14 common cancers, we conducted a large-scale, case-control study based on the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center.
Case-control study	Methods: A total of 5,240 cancer subjects and 10,480 age- and sex-matched noncancer controls were recruited.
Case-control study	Patients with 14 types of cancer newly diagnosed from 2000 to 2005 were eligible as case subjects, and new outpatients without cancer in the same time period were eligible as controls.
Case-control study	Tooth loss was categorized into four groups: group 1, number of remaining teeth, >or=21; group 2, 9 to 20; group 3, 1 to 8; and group 4, 0.
Case-control study	The effect of tooth loss was assessed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) calculated with conditional logistic regression models, with adjustment for potential confounders.
Case-control study	Results: A decreased number of remaining teeth was associated with increased OR of head and neck (OR, 1. 68; 95% CI, 0. 88-1. 93; P trend = 0. 055), esophageal (OR, 2. 36; 95% CI, 1. 17-4. 75; P trend = 0. 002), and lung (OR, 1. 54; 95% CI, 1. 05-2.
Case-control study	27; P trend = 0. 027) cancers. Conclusions: We showed a significant positive association between tooth loss and the risk of head and neck, esophageal, and lung cancers after adjustment for potential confounding factors.
Case-control study	The findings indicate that preventive efforts aimed at the preservation of teeth may decrease the risk of these cancers.
Case-control study	Teeth loss and risk of cancer at 14 common sites in Japanese
Cohort study	Background: Studies suggest that tooth loss and periodontal disease might increase the risk of developing various cancers; however, smoking might have confounded the reported associations.
Cohort study	We aimed to assess whether periodontal disease or tooth loss is associated with cancer risk.
Cohort study	Methods: The analysis was done in a prospective study (the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study [HPFS]), which was initiated in 1986 when US male health professionals aged 40-75 years responded to questionnaires posted by the Department of Nutrition, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.
Cohort study	In addition to the baseline questionnaires, follow-up questionnaires were posted to all living participants every 2 years and dietary questionnaires every 4 years.
Cohort study	At baseline, participants were asked whether they had a history of periodontal disease with bone loss.
Cohort study	Participants also reported number of natural teeth at baseline and any tooth loss during the previous 2 years was reported on the follow-up questionnaires.
Cohort study	Smoking status and history of smoking were obtained at baseline and in all subsequent questionnaires.
Cohort study	Additionally at baseline, participants reported their mean frequency of food intake over the previous year on a 131-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Participants reported any new cancer diagnosis on the follow-up questionnaires.
Cohort study	Endpoints for this study were risk of total cancer and individual cancers with more than 100 cases.
Cohort study	Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated by use of Cox proportional hazard models according to periodontal disease status and number of teeth at baseline. Findings: In the main analyses, 48 375 men with median follow-up of 17.
Cohort study	7 years (1986 to Jan 31, 2004) were eligible after excluding participants diagnosed with cancer before 1986 (other than non-melanoma skin cancer, n=2076) and those with missing data on periodontal disease (n=1078).
Cohort study	5720 incident cancer cases were documented (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and non-aggressive prostate cancer).
Cohort study	The five most common cancers were colorectal (n=1043), melanoma of the skin (n=698), lung (n=678), bladder (n=543), and advanced prostate (n=541).
Cohort study	After adjusting for known risk factors, including detailed smoking history and dietary factors, participants with a history of periodontal disease had an increased risk of total cancer (HR 1. 14 [95% CI 1. 07-1.
Cohort study	22]) compared with those with no history of periodontal disease. By cancer site, significant associations for those with a history of periodontal disease were noted for lung (1. 36 [1. 15-1. 60]), kidney (1. 49 [1. 12-1. 97]), pancreas (1. 54 [1.
Cohort study	16-2. 04]; findings previously published), and haematological cancers (1. 30 [1. 11-1. 53]). Fewer teeth at baseline (0-16) was associated with an increase in risk of lung cancer (1. 70 [1. 37-2.
Cohort study	11]) for those with 0-16 teeth versus those with 25-32 teeth. In never-smokers, periodontal disease was associated with significant increases in total (1. 21 [1. 06-1. 39]) and haematological cancers (1. 35 [1. 01-1. 81]).
Cohort study	By contrast, no association was noted for lung cancer (0. 96 [0. 46-1. 98]). Interpretation: Periodontal disease was associated with a small, but significant, increase in overall cancer risk, which persisted in never-smokers.
Cohort study	The associations recorded for lung cancer are probably because of residual confounding by smoking.
Cohort study	The increased risks noted for haematological, kidney, and pancreatic cancers need confirmation, but suggest that periodontal disease might be a marker of a susceptible immune system or might directly affect cancer risk.

Cohort study	Objective: Tooth loss has been associated with upper gastrointestinal cancer in several studies, but only one previous study used prospectively collected data. The importance of confounding by Helicobacter pylori has not previously been addressed.
Cohort study	The objective was to determine the association between tooth loss and upper gastrointestinal cancer in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort and to determine the importance of potentially confounding dietary factors or H.
Cohort study	pylori seropositivity.
Cohort study	Material and methods: A prospective cohort study with 29,124 subjects included 49 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 66 esophageal/gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, and 179 gastric non-cardia adenocarcinomas occurring between 1985 and 1999.
Cohort study	Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and education were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated with and without adjustment for H.
Cohort study	pylori seropositivity in a nested case-control group to determine whether H. pylori confounded the association between tooth loss and gastric cancer.
Cohort study	Results: Tooth loss significantly increased the hazard ratio for gastric non-cardia cancer, the HR (95% CI) for edentulous subjects versus those with < 10 teeth lost was 1. 65 (1. 09, 2. 49, respectively).
Cohort study	No statistically significant associations were found between tooth loss and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or esophageal/gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. Confounding by dietary factors, tobacco smoking, or H. pylori did not explain these results.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Tooth loss was associated with increased risk of gastric non-cardia cancer, but not esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or esophageal/gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in this Finnish cohort.
Cohort study	Tooth loss is associated with increased risk of gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma in a cohort of Finnish smokers
Cross-sectional study	Background: The rise in adenocarcinoma (AC) of the esophagus has been reported in several papers. However, the results are only comparable to a limited extent, because they are based on differing periods and different computational methods.
Cross-sectional study	The purpose of the current investigation was to collect the available data and to analyze them in a unified manner.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: The authors requested data on the incidence of AC of the esophagus for each year since 1960 from 43 tumor registries in North America, Europe, and Australia. The data from 22 centers were used.
Cross-sectional study	The trend was calculated by fitting the data to an exponential growth model. Results: The incidence of AC of the esophagus in white males is rising in most countries.
Cross-sectional study	The highest values of the estimated incidence rate in the year 2000 were found in Great Britain (5. 0- 8. 7 cases per 100,000 population) and in Australia (4. 8 cases per 100,000 population) followed by The Netherlands (4.
Cross-sectional study	4 cases per 100,000 population), the United States (3. 7 cases per 100,000 population), and Denmark (2. 8 cases per 100,000 population). Low rates (< 1. 0 cases per 100,000 population) were found in Eastern Europe.
Cross-sectional study	The largest changes in incidence were reported in the Southern European countries, with an estimate of the average increase over six registries of 30% per year; in Australia, with an average increase of 23.
Cross-sectional study	5% per year; and in the United States, with an average increase of 20. 6% per year. The rates of increase ranged from 8. 7% to 17. 5% on average in Northern Europe, Central Europe, and the United Kingdom.
Cross-sectional study	In Eastern Europe, at most, there was a minor rise in incidence. Conclusions: In the Western industrialized nations, the analyzed data show that the incidence of AC of the esophagus has been rising rapidly in the last 20 years.
Cross-sectional study	The only exceptions to date are the countries of Eastern Europe.
Cross-sectional study	Demographic variations in the rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in white males
Cross-sectional study	Analyses of cancer incidence data from nine areas of the United States revealed steadily rising rates from 1976 to 1987 of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia.
Cross-sectional study	The increases among men in this period ranged from 4% to 10% per year, and thus exceeded those of any other type of cancer.
Cross-sectional study	In contrast, there were relatively stable trends for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and slight declines for adenocarcinoma of more distal portions of the stomach.
Cross-sectional study	Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia disproportionately affected white men and rarely occurred among women.
Cross-sectional study	By the mid-1980s, among white men, adenocarcinomas accounted for about one third of all esophageal cancers, while cardia cancers accounted for about one half of all stomach cancers with specified subsites.
Cross-sectional study	The rising incidence rates and similar demographic patterns point to the need for investigation into the causes of these poorly understood cancers.
Cross-sectional study	Rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia
review	Esophageal cancer displays unique epidemiologic features that distinguish it from all other malignancies.
review	It shows marked geographic variation both internationally, with exceptionally high rates (some of the world's highest for any cancer) in limited areas of Asia, and nationally, with clustering of increased rates within the United States as well.
review	However, the patterns are changing with rates of squamous cell carcinomas decreasing and adenocarcinomas increasing rapidly in several western countries.
review	The causes of the clusters of squamous cell carcinomas in parts of Asia and Africa are not well known, but within the United States and other western countries, tobacco and alcohol consumption are the major determinants.
review	Nutritional factors also may play a major role, with diets high in fresh fruits and vegetables consistently associated with reduced risks.
review	The causes of the rapidly increasing rates of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, and reasons or its occurrence primarily among white men, are enigmatic.
review	Additional research on the etiology of this emerging cell type is warranted, and may provide information crucial to the development of readily implementable preventive strategies.
review	Esophageal cancer trends and risk factors
Cross-sectional study	Background: The prognosis for patients with esophageal carcinoma is poor, with less than fifty percent surviving 1 year after diagnosis.
Cross-sectional study	Although diagnostic and staging methods have improved, a large proportion of patients present with advanced disease. Research is being conducted to determine what multimodality treatment regimens provide the best local control and survival.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Using the National Cancer Data Base's most current accrual of oncologic data for cases diagnosed in 1988 and 1993, patterns of care and outcome were analyzed for esophageal carcinoma.
Cross-sectional study	Results: A substantial increase was demonstrated between 1988 and 1993 in the proportion of esophageal adenocarcinomas and patients presenting with Stage IV disease.
Cross-sectional study	The therapeutic regimen most frequently employed in 1993 was combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which rose 8. 2% from 2. 2% in 1988.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: The dramatic rise across the years of this study in the occurrence of esophageal adenocarcinomas indicates a need for developing strategies to evaluate Barrett's preneoplastic mucosal changes more precisely.
Cross-sectional study	The increasing use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy reflects the results of randomized trials that have demonstrated improved response and outcome for this combined regimen compared with radiation therapy alone.
Cross-sectional study	There was no substantial increase in the use of surgical resection with chemotherapy and radiation therapy throughout these years.
Cross-sectional study	National Cancer Data Base report on esophageal carcinoma
Cross-sectional study	Objective: We described incidence rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Denmark in a 20-yr period and determined the proportion of patients diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma who had a previous diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, making them potential candidates for endoscopic surveillance.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Rates of esophageal and gastric cancers were collected from the Danish Cancer registry for the period 1970-1991. The registry was used to identify all cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the period 1987-1992.
Cross-sectional study	Medical records were retrieved and details concerning previous diagnosis of reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus were recorded. Results: The age- and gender-adjusted incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma increased eightfold, from 0.
Cross-sectional study	3/10(5)/yr in 1970 to 2. 3/10(5)/yr in 1990. This increase could not be explained by changes in classification or diagnostic routines.
Cross-sectional study	Medical data were retrieved for 524 of the 578 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma reported during the period 1987-1992. A history of reflux symptoms or a diagnosis compatible with reflux was reported in 113 of 524 patients.
Cross-sectional study	A total of 119 patients (23%) had previously been investigated for dyspepsia or reflux symptoms, most often by endoscopy. A previous diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus was found in only 1. 3% of the cancer patients.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: The rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Denmark has increased eightfold over a 20-yr period, and this increase is not explained by changes in classification or diagnostic routines.
Cross-sectional study	More than 98% of esophageal adenocarcinomas were found in patients who could not have entered endoscopic surveillance, as Barrett's esophagus had not been diagnosed before the cancer diagnosis.
Cross-sectional study	Endoscopic surveillance to detect dysplasia may be an option for the individual patient with Barrett's esophagus, but these screening programs are not likely to reduce the death rate from esophageal adenocarcinomas in the general population.
Cross-sectional study	Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and Barrett's esophagus: a population-based study
review	Use of tobacco, moderate to heavy alcohol ingestion, infrequent consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, and low income accounted for more [figure: see text] than 98% of the SCE rates among both African American and white men and for 99% of the excess incidence among African Americans compared to whites in a case-control study in three areas of the United States [14].
review	Thus, it is likely that declines in the prevalence of smoking and drinking, especially among men, and increased intake of fresh fruits and vegetables may have contributed to the downward incidence and mortality rate trends reported for SCE.
review	In addition, it seems plausible that obesity, GERD, and possibly reductions in H. pylori prevalence have contributed to the upward trends in ACE rates. Reductions in smoking, improved diet, and reductions in H.
review	pylori prevalence probably have contributed to the consistent reductions observed for NGA. Contributing factors are less clear for the rising incidence rates of GCA during the 1970s and 1980s.
review	These incidence rates have not continued to rise in recent years.
review	Epidemiologic trends in esophageal and gastric cancer in the United States
Cross-sectional study	Objective: About 20 years ago, the scientific community was first alerted to an enigmatic increase of oesophageal adenocarcinomas in the UK and USA. Subsequently, a virtual epidemic-still unexplained-was confirmed in several western countries.
Cross-sectional study	Detailed descriptive data might provide clues to its causes. Design: We collected data on incident cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma from population-based cancer registries in Australia, Europe, North America and Asia.
Cross-sectional study	We calculated age-standardised incidence rates and fitted log-linear Poisson models to assess annual rate of increase and to disentangle age-period-cohort effects, linear spine models to estimate rate of increase since 1985, and Joinpoint models to identify possible inflection points.
Cross-sectional study	Results: With considerable between-registry variation in magnitude and timing, we found a consistent dramatic increase in incidence with an observed or estimated start between 1960 and 1990. The average annual increase ranged from 3.
Cross-sectional study	5% in Scotland to 8. 1% in Hawaii with similar proportional increase among men and women in most registries and a maintained three to sixfold higher incidence among men.
Cross-sectional study	Generally, calendar period was a more important determinant of incidence trends than birth cohort. Where possible to conduct, Joinpoint analyses indicated that the onset of the epidemic varied considerably even between neighbouring countries.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Given the preponderant period effect and the abrupt onset observed or inferred in most populations, the epidemic appears to be caused by some exposure that was first introduced around 1950.
Cross-sectional study	At least 30 years' variation in estimated time of onset opens prospects for hypothesis-generating ecological analyses.
Cross-sectional study	A global assessment of the oesophageal adenocarcinoma epidemic
Cross-sectional study	Background: In the United States, the rates and temporal trends of oesophageal cancer overall and for the two predominant histologic types - adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) - differ between Blacks and Whites, but little is known with regard to the patterns among Asians/Pacific Islanders or Hispanics.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programme data, we analysed oesophageal cancer incidence patterns by race, sex, and histologic type for the period 1977-2005.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Total oesophageal cancer incidence has been increasing among Whites only; the rates among all other race groups have declined. Moreover, rates among White men surpassed those among Blacks in 2004.
Cross-sectional study	Oesophageal SCC rates have been decreasing among virtually all racial/ethnic groups; rates among Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander men have been intermediate to those of Blacks and Whites, with rates among women being lower than those among Blacks or Whites.
Cross-sectional study	The ADC rates among Hispanic men may be rising, akin to the historical trends among Whites and Blacks. The sex ratios for these cancers also varied markedly. Conclusions: These observations may provide clues for aetiological research.
Cross-sectional study	Oesophageal cancer incidence in the United States by race, sex, and histologic type, 1977-2005
Cross-sectional study	Since 1970, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased rapidly in Western populations, whereas the incidences of gastric cardia and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma have increased moderately and declined, respectively.
Cross-sectional study	The Swedish Cancer Register and Total Population Register provided opportunities for a valid update of incidence trends of these tumors including the year 2008. Joinpoint regression was used to assess any shifts in trends with calendar time.
Cross-sectional study	The esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence reached a peak in 2005, and then showed a decrease. During the period 2001-2008, the joinpoint regression analysis indicates a virtually stable incidence (annual percentage increase 1.
Cross-sectional study	1, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2. 7 to 5. 1). The cardia adenocarcinoma incidence has slightly decreased after 1990 (annual percentage decrease -1. 0, 95% CI -1. 6 to -0. 3).
Cross-sectional study	The decreasing incidence of gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma has continued steadily during recent years (annual percentage decrease -4. 9 (95% CI -5. 2 to -4. 7).
Cross-sectional study	Thus, an encouraging break in the rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been seen in Sweden since 2005, whereas the corresponding incidences of gastric cardia and non-cardia adenocarcinoma have been stable and decreasing, respectively.
Cross-sectional study	No further increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Sweden
Cross-sectional study	Several Western countries have reported a decrease in the incidence of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma and a strong increase in the incidence of oesophageal and cardia adenocarcinoma.
Cross-sectional study	We examined incidence rates of gastric and oesophageal cancer by subsite and histology in Central Switzerland over the last 26 years.
Cross-sectional study	Data on biopsy-diagnosed gastric and oesophageal carcinoma incidence during 1982-2007 were obtained from the Cancer Registry of the Institute of Pathology, Lucerne, the Medical Centre for Central Switzerland.
Cross-sectional study	Age-adjusted (standardized to the European standard population), and sex-specific incidence rates were calculated.
Cross-sectional study	In total, 2,322 cancers were diagnosed: 1,240 noncardia gastric adenocarcinomas, 459 cardia gastric adenocarcinomas, 248 oesophageal adenocarcinomas, and 375 squamous cell carcinomas.
Cross-sectional study	From 1982 to 2007, the incidence rates of noncardia adenocarcinoma decreased substantially from 17. 9 (per 100,000) to 6. 0 in men and 10. 3 to 5. 5 in women. In men, the incidence of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma decreased from 7. 5 to 4.
Cross-sectional study	3, the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma increased from 3. 3 to 4. 8, and the incidence of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma decreased from 6. 6 to 4. 1; the incidence rates of these cancers were low in women (1. 1-2. 4).
Cross-sectional study	In conclusion, the incidence of gastric noncardia carcinoma has decreased substantially over the past 26 years. In contrast to other Western countries, the incidence of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma did not increase in Central Switzerland.
Cross-sectional study	Whereas the rate of oesophageal adenocarcinoma increased, the rate of squamous cell carcinoma decreased. These results suggest substantial changes in environmental and life-style risk factors over the past 26 years.
Cross-sectional study	Changing incidence of gastric and oesophageal cancer subtypes in central Switzerland between 1982 and 2007
Cross-sectional study	Rapid increases in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus have been reported among white men.
Cross-sectional study	We further explored the temporal patterns of this disease among white individuals by sex, stage, and age by use of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program.
Cross-sectional study	We identified 22,759 patients from January 1, 1975, through December 31, 2004, with esophageal cancer, of whom 9526 were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Cross-sectional study	Among white men, increases in the incidence of esophageal cancer were largely attributed to a 463% increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma over this time period, from 1. 01 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0. 90 to 1.
Cross-sectional study	13) in 1975-1979 to 5. 69 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = 5. 47 to 5. 91) in 2000-2004. A similar rapid increase was also apparent among white women, among whom the adenocarcinoma rate increased 335%, from 0. 17 (95% CI = 0. 13 to 0. 21) to 0.
Cross-sectional study	74 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = 0. 67 to 0. 81), over the same time period. Adenocarcinoma rates rose among white men and women in all stage and age groups, indicating that these increases are real and not an artifact of surveillance.
Cross-sectional study	Incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus among white Americans by sex, stage, and age
Cross-sectional study	Background and aims: It has been suggested that gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) is a distinct entity from oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA).
Cross-sectional study	We examined several epidemiological features of GCA and OA in the USA to elucidate differences/similarities between these malignancies.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Using the database of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, we examined incidence rates for temporal changes, and ethnic and age distributions, and performed birth cohort analyses for cases with morphologically and histologically confirmed OA or GCA.
Cross-sectional study	Results: The age adjusted incidence rates of OA rose progressively, reaching 1. 8 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 1. 7-1. 9) during 1987-1991 and 2. 5 per 100 000 (2. 3-2. 6) during 1992-1996.
Cross-sectional study	In 1992-1996, Whites were affected five times more than Blacks, and men eight times more than women. A significant increase in incidence occurred among younger persons aged 45-65 years.
Cross-sectional study	Irrespective of age, OA was characterised by higher incidence rates among more recent birth cohorts: a 40% increase in incidence for each five year increase in the date of birth--a "birth cohort effect".
Cross-sectional study	On the other hand, the incidence rates of GCA reached their highest level of 3. 3 per 100 000 (3. 2-3. 4) in 1987-1991 and subsequently declined during 1992-1996 to 3. 1 per 100 000 (3. 0-3. 3).
Cross-sectional study	Whites were affected twice more than blacks and men five times more than women. Most patients with GCA were older than 60 years with no increase among younger persons and no birth cohort effect (p=0. 99).
Cross-sectional study	Conclusion: Several significant epidemiological differences exist between OA and GCA. These differences suggest that these two malignancies are separate entities with different risk factors.
Cross-sectional study	Epidemiological differences between adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia in the USA
Cross-sectional study	Background: Over the past several decades, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has rapidly increased.
Cross-sectional study	The purpose of this analysis was to examine temporal trends in EAC incidence and mortality within the US population and, in addition, to explore these trends within subgroups of the population.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER 9) data were used to examine incidence and incidence-based (IB) mortality in EAC from 1975 to 2009.
Cross-sectional study	Secular trends in incidence and IB mortality by cancer stage, sex, and race were further characterized using the NCI's Joinpoint Regression program.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Based on SEER 9 data, EAC incidence and IB mortality continues to increase in the United States. However, since the mid-1990s, the overall rate of increase in both EAC incidence and IB mortality appears to be slowing.
Cross-sectional study	In addition, in early-stage cancers, there is a noticeable leveling off of IB mortality rates and divergence from incidence starting in the late 1990s. Over the study period, the average annual percentage increase in incidence was 6. 1% in men and 5.
Cross-sectional study	9% in women. Conclusions: EAC incidence and IB mortality rates continue to rise in the United States, although at a slower rate in more recent years.
Cross-sectional study	In early-stage cancers, IB mortality and incidence rates have diverged primarily because IB mortality rates have plateaued beginning in the late 1990s.
Cross-sectional study	Although EAC continues to be less common in women, the rate of increase in EAC incidence is similar in both sexes.
Cross-sectional study	Trends in esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence and mortality
Cross-sectional study	Background: Reports of dramatic increases in gastric cardia cancer incidence warrant concern.
Cross-sectional study	However, the recent introduction of a separate diagnostic code, the lack of a consensus definition of the cardia area, and the accelerating interest in cardia cancer may affect classification practices.
Cross-sectional study	Little is known about the magnitude of cardia cancer misclassification in large cancer registries. Methods: In a well-defined Swedish population (1.
Cross-sectional study	3 million), we uniformly classified all patients with newly diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma (from 1989 through 1994) with respect to gastric subsite, and we used this patient group as our gold standard.
Cross-sectional study	We then evaluated the completeness of the Swedish Cancer Registry in registering gastric adenocarcinomas against this gold standard and, further, assessed the completeness of cardia cancer registration and the rate of falsely included cases to estimate the potential impact on observed incidence trends.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Our gold standard contained 1337 case subjects with gastric adenocarcinoma. Overall, the Swedish Cancer Registry was 98% complete with regard to gastric adenocarcinomas and had a 4% rate of falsely included cases.
Cross-sectional study	The completeness of coding cardia cancer was only 69%, and the positive predictive value for cardia cancer was 82%, with no improvement over time.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Although overall completeness of gastric cancer registration by the Swedish Cancer Registry was excellent, accuracy in registering cardia tumors was surprisingly low.
Cross-sectional study	Our estimates suggest that true cardia cancer incidence could be up to 45% higher or 15% lower than that reported in the Cancer Registry. This margin of error could accommodate the observed increase in cardia cancer in Sweden.
Cross-sectional study	Therefore, secular trends in cardia cancer incidence should be interpreted cautiously.
Cross-sectional study	Evaluating gastric cancer misclassification: a potential explanation for the rise in cardia cancer incidence
Cross-sectional study	Background: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is rising dramatically.
Cross-sectional study	This increase may reflect increased disease burden, reclassification of related cancers, or overdiagnosis resulting from increased diagnostic intensity, particularly upper endoscopy for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or Barrett esophagus.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: We used the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to extract information on incidence, stage distribution, and disease-specific mortality for esophageal adenocarcinoma as well as information on related cancers.
Cross-sectional study	Results: From 1975 to 2001, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma rose approximately sixfold in the United States (from 4 to 23 cases per million), a relative increase greater than that for melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer.
Cross-sectional study	Reclassification of squamous cell carcinoma is an unlikely explanation for the rise in incidence, because the anatomic distribution of esophageal cancer in general has changed.
Cross-sectional study	The only location with increased incidence is the lower third of the esophagus-the site where adenocarcinoma typically arises. Reclassification of adjacent gastric cancer is also unlikely because its incidence has also increased.
Cross-sectional study	Because there has been little change in the proportion of patients found with in situ or localized disease at diagnosis since 1975 (from 25% to 31%) and because esophageal adenocarcinoma mortality has increased more than sevenfold (from 2 to 15 deaths per million), overdiagnosis can be excluded as an explanation for the rise in incidence.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusion: The rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma represents a real increase in disease burden.
Cross-sectional study	The role of overdiagnosis and reclassification in the marked increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence
Case-control study	Purpose: Apoptosis pathway, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (reflux), higher body mass index (BMI), and tobacco smoking have been individually associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) development.
Case-control study	However, how multiple factors jointly affect EA risk remains unclear. Patients and methods: In total, 305 patients with EA and 339 age- and sex-matched controls were studied.
Case-control study	High-order interactions among reflux, BMI, smoking, and functional polymorphisms in five apoptotic genes (FAS, FASL, IL1B, TP53BP, and BAT3) were investigated by entropy-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), classification and regression tree (CART), and traditional logistic regression (LR) models.
Case-control study	Results: In LR analysis, reflux, BMI, and smoking were significantly associated with EA risk, with reflux as the strongest individual factor. No individual single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with EA susceptibility.
Case-control study	However, there was a two-way interaction between IL1B + 3954C>T and reflux (P =. 008). In both CART and MDR analyses, reflux was also the strongest individual factor for EA risk.
Case-control study	In individuals with reflux symptoms, CART analysis indicated that strongest interaction was among variant genotypes of IL1B + 3954C>T and BAT3S625P, higher BMI, and smoking (odds ratio [OR], 5. 76; 95% CI, 2. 48 to 13.
Case-control study	38), a finding independently found using MDR analysis. In contrast, for participants without reflux symptoms, the strongest interaction was found between higher BMI and smoking (OR, 3. 27; 95% CI, 1. 88 to 5.
Case-control study	68), also echoed by entropy-based MDR analysis. Conclusion: Although a history of reflux is an important risk for EA, multifactor interactions also play important roles in EA risk.
Case-control study	Gene-environment interaction patterns differ between patients with and without reflux symptoms.
Case-control study	Interactions among genetic variants in apoptosis pathway genes, reflux symptoms, body mass index, and smoking indicate two distinct etiologic patterns of esophageal adenocarcinoma
Case-control study	Esophageal (EA) and esophagogastric junction (EGJA) adenocarcinoma have been steadily increasing in frequency in younger people; however, the etiology of these cancers is poorly understood.
Case-control study	We therefore investigated associations of body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, gastroesophageal reflux and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in relation to age-specific risks of EA and EGJA.
Case-control study	We pooled individual participant data from eight population-based, case-control studies within the international Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON).
Case-control study	The analysis included 1,363 EA patients, 1,472 EGJA patients and 5,728 control participants.
Case-control study	Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for age-specific (<50, 50-59, 60-69, ≥70 years) cancer outcomes, as well as interactions by age.
Case-control study	BMI, smoking status and pack-years, recurrent gastroesophageal reflux and frequency of gastroesophageal reflux were positively associated with EA and EGJA in each age group.
Case-control study	Early-onset EA (<50 years) had stronger associations with recurrent gastroesophageal reflux (OR = 8. 06, 95% CI: 4. 52, 14. 37; peffect modification = 0. 01) and BMI (ORBMI ≥ 30 vs. <25 = 4. 19, 95% CI: 2. 23, 7. 87; peffect modification = 0.
Case-control study	04), relative to older age groups. In contrast, inverse associations of NSAID use were strongest in the oldest age group (≥70 years), although this apparent difference was not statistically significant.
Case-control study	Age-specific associations with EGJA showed similar, but slightly weaker patterns and no statistically significant differences by age were observed.
Case-control study	Our study provides evidence that associations between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux are stronger among earlier onset EA cancers.
Case-control study	Age-specific risk factor profiles of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus: A pooled analysis from the international BEACON consortium
Case-control study	Background: The causes of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia are poorly understood. We conducted an epidemiologic investigation of the possible association between gastroesophageal reflux and these tumors.
Case-control study	Methods: We performed a nationwide, population-based, case-control study in Sweden. Case ascertainment was rapid, and all cases were classified uniformly.
Case-control study	Information on the subjects' history of gastroesophageal reflux was collected in personal interviews. The odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression, with multivariate adjustment for potentially confounding variables.
Case-control study	Results: Of the patients interviewed, the 189 with esophageal adenocarcinoma and the 262 with adenocarcinoma of the cardia constituted 85 percent of the 529 patients in Sweden who were eligible for the study during the period from 1995 through 1997.
Case-control study	For comparison, we interviewed 820 control subjects from the general population and 167 patients with esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.
Case-control study	Among persons with recurrent symptoms of reflux, as compared with persons without such symptoms, the odds ratios were 7. 7 (95 percent confidence interval, 5. 3 to 11. 4) for esophageal adenocarcinoma and 2. 0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.
Case-control study	4 to 2. 9) for adenocarcinoma of the cardia. The more frequent, more severe, and longer-lasting the symptoms of reflux, the greater the risk. Among persons with long-standing and severe symptoms of reflux, the odds ratios were 43.
Case-control study	5 (95 percent confidence interval, 18. 3 to 103. 5) for esophageal adenocarcinoma and 4. 4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 7 to 11. 0) for adenocarcinoma of the cardia.
Case-control study	The risk of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not associated with reflux (odds ratio, 1. 1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 7 to 1. 9).
Case-control study	Conclusions: There is a strong and probably causal relation between gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The relation between reflux and adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia is relatively weak.
Case-control study	Symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux as a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma
meta analysis	Background: Endoscopic screening has been proposed for patients with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the hope of reducing mortality from oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	Assessing the net benefits of such a strategy requires a precise understanding of the cancer risk in the screened population. Aim: To estimate precisely the association between symptoms of GERD and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies with strict ascertainment of exposure and outcomes. Results: Five eligible studies were identified.
meta analysis	At least weekly symptoms of GERD increased the odds of oesophageal adenocarcinoma fivefold (odds ratio = 4. 92; 95% confidence interval = 3. 90, 6. 22), and daily symptoms increased the odds sevenfold (random effects summary odds ratio = 7.
meta analysis	40, 95% confidence interval = 4. 94, 11. 1), each compared with individuals without symptoms or less frequent symptoms.
meta analysis	Duration of symptoms was also associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma, but with very heterogeneous results, and unclear thresholds. Conclusions: Frequent GERD symptoms are strongly associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	These results should be useful in developing epidemiological models of the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and in models of interventions aimed at reducing mortality from this cancer.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis: the association of oesophageal adenocarcinoma with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux
Cohort study	Background & aims: Gastroesophageal reflux has been proposed as an important risk factor for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, but prospective data are lacking. Furthermore, the effect of antireflux surgery has not yet been studied.
Cohort study	We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study to fill these gaps.
Cohort study	Methods: A cohort of 35,274 male and 31,691 female patients with a discharge diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux diseases, and another cohort of 6406 male and 4671 female patients who underwent antireflux surgery, were identified in the Swedish Inpatient Register.
Cohort study	Follow-up was attained through record linkage with several nationwide registers. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used to estimate relative risk of upper gastrointestinal cancers, using the general Swedish population as reference.
Cohort study	Results: After exclusion of the first year follow-up, 37 esophageal and 36 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas were observed among male patients who did not have surgery (SIR, 6. 3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 4. 5-8. 7; SIR, 2. 4, 95% CI, 1. 7-3.
Cohort study	3, respectively). SIR for esophageal adenocarcinoma increased with follow-up time (P = 0. 03 for trend). Among male patients who had undergone antireflux surgeries, risks were also elevated (16 esophageal adenocarcinoma, SIR, 14. 1, 95% CI, 8. 0-22.
Cohort study	8; 15 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, SIR, 5. 3, 95% CI, 3. 0-8. 7) and remained elevated with time after surgery. The cancer risk pattern in women was similar to that for men, but the number of cases were much smaller.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Gastroesophageal reflux is strongly associated with the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and to a lesser extent, with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma.
Cohort study	The risk of developing adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia remains increased after antireflux surgery.
Cohort study	Risk of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia in patients with gastroesophageal reflux diseases and after antireflux surgery
Cohort study	Background & aims: The question of a possible preventive effect of antireflux surgery on the development of esophageal or cardia adenocarcinoma remains unsettled.
Cohort study	We aimed to clarify whether antireflux surgery prevents later development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Methods: We performed a Swedish population-based cohort study of antireflux surgery from 1965 to 2006.
Cohort study	Follow-up evaluation for cancer and censoring for death and emigration were achieved up to December 31, 2006, through linkages to nationwide registers of cancer, population, and emigration.
Cohort study	The cancer incidence in the antireflux surgery cohort was compared with that in the corresponding Swedish population.
Cohort study	Relative risks were presented as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), that is, the observed number of cancer cases in the antireflux surgery cohort divided by the expected number.
Cohort study	Results: The antireflux surgery cohort comprised 14,102 persons, contributing 120,514 person-years at risk. Overall risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 39) was increased 12-fold (SIR, 12. 3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8. 7-16. 8).
Cohort study	No risk decrease with time after antireflux surgery was found (P =. 86). After a postsurgical follow-up evaluation of 15 years or more, the SIR was 14. 6 (95% CI, 7. 0-26. 8).
Cohort study	For the corresponding overall risk of cardia adenocarcinoma (n = 21) the SIR was 4. 4 (95% CI, 2. 7-6. 7), without any major decrease in risk with time (P =. 20); the SIR was 3. 1 (95% CI, 0. 6-9. 1) after at least 15 years of follow-up evaluation.
Cohort study	No association between antireflux surgery and gastric adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was identified.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Antireflux surgery cannot be considered to prevent the development of esophageal or cardia adenocarcinoma among persons with reflux.
Cohort study	The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma after antireflux surgery
Cohort study	Background: Accurate population-based data are needed on the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia among patients with Barrett's esophagus.
Cohort study	Methods: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, cohort study involving all patients with Barrett's esophagus in Denmark during the period from 1992 through 2009, using data from the Danish Pathology Registry and the Danish Cancer Registry.
Cohort study	We determined the incidence rates (numbers of cases per 1000 person-years) of adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia.
Cohort study	As a measure of relative risk, standardized incidence ratios were calculated with the use of national cancer rates in Denmark during the study period.
Cohort study	Results: We identified 11,028 patients with Barrett's esophagus and analyzed their data for a median of 5. 2 years. Within the first year after the index endoscopy, 131 new cases of adenocarcinoma were diagnosed.
Cohort study	During subsequent years, 66 new adenocarcinomas were detected, yielding an incidence rate for adenocarcinoma of 1. 2 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 9 to 1. 5).
Cohort study	As compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of adenocarcinoma among patients with Barrett's esophagus was 11. 3 (95% CI, 8. 8 to 14. 4). The annual risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was 0. 12% (95% CI, 0. 09 to 0. 15).
Cohort study	Detection of low-grade dysplasia on the index endoscopy was associated with an incidence rate for adenocarcinoma of 5. 1 cases per 1000 person-years. In contrast, the incidence rate among patients without dysplasia was 1. 0 case per 1000 person-years.
Cohort study	Risk estimates for patients with high-grade dysplasia were slightly higher. Conclusions: Barrett's esophagus is a strong risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the absolute annual risk, 0. 12%, is much lower than the assumed risk of 0.
Cohort study	5%, which is the basis for current surveillance guidelines. Data from the current study call into question the rationale for ongoing surveillance in patients who have Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia.

Cohort study	Incidence of adenocarcinoma among patients with Barrett's esophagus
meta analysis	Objectives: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been used for treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE) for many years. However, the connection between PPIs and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with BE has still been controversial.
meta analysis	The current systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the association between PPIs and the risk of EAC or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in patients with BE.
meta analysis	Methods: A systematic literature search of studies reporting the association between PPIs and the risk of EAC and/or HGD in patients with BE was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library.
meta analysis	Next, literature was screened using previously established criteria and relevant data were extracted from included studies. Finally, the software program Review Manage 5. 2 was applied to aggregate data and analyze the results.
meta analysis	Results: Nine observational studies, comprising five cohort and four case-control studies (including a total of 5712 patients with BE), were identified.
meta analysis	Upon meta-analysis, PPIs were found to have no association with the risk of EAC and/or HGD in patients with BE (unadjusted OR 0. 43, 95% CI 0. 17-1. 08).
meta analysis	Analysis for duration response relationship revealed no significant trend toward protection against EAC or HGD with PPIs usage for >2~3 years (one study using 7-year cutoff) when compared to usage for shorter time periods (PPIs usage >2~3 years vs.
meta analysis	<2~3 years: OR 0. 91 (95% CI 0. 25-3. 31) vs. 0. 91 (0. 40-2. 07)). There also was considerable heterogeneity between studies. Conclusion: No dysplasia- or cancer-protective effects of PPIs usage in patients with BE were identified by our analysis.
meta analysis	Therefore, we conclude that clinicians who discuss the potential chemopreventive effects of PPIs with their patients, should be aware that such an effect, if exists, has not been proven with statistical significance.
meta analysis	Proton Pump Inhibitors Do Not Reduce the Risk of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma in Patients with Barrett's Esophagus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
meta analysis	Purpose: Previous research on the association between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in Barrett's Esophagus (BE) patients has generated inconsistent findings.
meta analysis	This meta-analysis was performed to clarify the association. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search strategy to select relevant studies up to September 2020. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic.
meta analysis	Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated through either fixed-effects or random-effects model. Duration-response was also performed to assess the gain effects of different PPI intake duration.
meta analysis	Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analyses, and tests for publication bias or other small-study effects were conducted. Results: Twelve studies with 155,769 subjects were included.
meta analysis	The PPI use was associated with the reduced risk of BE progression to HGD/EAC (OR = 0. 47, 95% CI = 0. 32-0. 71). In the duration-response analysis, the estimated OR for decreased risk of HGD/EAC with PPI intake duration of 12 months was 0.
meta analysis	81 (95% CI = 0. 71-0. 91). Sensitivity analysis suggested the results of this meta-analysis were stable. No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: PPI use is associated with a decreased risk of HGD/EAC in patients with BE.
meta analysis	For further investigation, that more well-designed studies are still needed to elucidate the protective effect of PPI usage on BE patients to prevent HGD/EAC.
meta analysis	Do proton pump inhibitors prevent Barrett's esophagus progression to high-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma? An updated meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Previous studies that showed an association between smoking and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction were limited in their ability to assess differences by tumor site, sex, dose-response, and duration of cigarette smoking cessation.
meta analysis	Methods: We used primary data from 10 population-based case-control studies and two cohort studies from the Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium. Analyses were restricted to white non-Hispanic men and women.
meta analysis	Patients were classified as having esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 1540), esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (n = 1450), or a combination of both (all adenocarcinoma; n = 2990). Control subjects (n = 9453) were population based.
meta analysis	Associations between pack-years of cigarette smoking and risks of adenocarcinomas were assessed, as well as their potential modification by sex and duration of smoking cessation.
meta analysis	Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) estimated using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, education, and gastroesophageal reflux, were pooled using a meta-analytic methodology to generate summary odds ratios.
meta analysis	All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The summary odds ratios demonstrated strong associations between cigarette smoking and esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1. 96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1. 64 to 2.
meta analysis	34), esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (OR = 2. 18, 95% CI = 1. 84 to 2. 58), and all adenocarcinoma (OR = 2. 08, 95% CI = 1. 83 to 2. 37).
meta analysis	In addition, there was a strong dose-response association between pack-years of cigarette smoking and each outcome (P <. 001).
meta analysis	Compared with current smokers, longer smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all adenocarcinoma after adjusting for pack-years (<10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0. 82, 95% CI = 0. 60 to 1.
meta analysis	13; and > or =10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0. 71, 95% CI = 0. 56 to 0. 89). Sex-specific summary odds ratios were similar.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in white men and women; compared with current smoking, smoking cessation was associated with reduced risks.
meta analysis	Cigarette smoking and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction: a pooled analysis from the international BEACON consortium
meta analysis	Background: Smoking has been related to esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, but the magnitude of the association is uncertain. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 33 studies published up to January 2010.
meta analysis	We derived summary estimates using random-effects models. Results: Compared with never-smokers, the pooled relative risk (RR) was 1. 76 (95% confidence interval = 1. 54-2. 01) for ever-smokers, 2. 32 (1. 96-2. 75) for current smokers, and 1. 62 (1.
meta analysis	40-1. 87) for ex-smokers. There was no important difference between esophageal (RR = 1. 85 for ever- vs. never-smokers) and gastric cardia (RR = 1. 76) adenocarcinoma. We found a direct association with dose (RR = 2. 48 [2. 14-2.
meta analysis	86] for ≥ 20 cigarettes/d) and duration (RR = 2. 32 [1. 92-2. 82] for ≥ 40 years) of cigarette consumption. Conclusions: This meta-analysis estimates the excess of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma risk for smokers.
meta analysis	This risk was similar for the 2 cancer sites.
meta analysis	Tobacco smoking and esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: In order to provide a precise quantification of the association between alcohol drinking and esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of available data.
meta analysis	Patients and methods: We identified 20 case-control and 4 cohort studies, including a total of 5500 cases.
meta analysis	We derived meta-analytic estimates using random-effects models, taking into account correlation between estimates, and we carried out a dose-risk analysis using nonlinear random-effects meta-regression models.
meta analysis	Results: The relative risk (RR) for drinkers versus nondrinkers was 0. 96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 85-1. 09] overall, 0. 87 (95% CI 0. 74-1. 01) for esophageal adenocarcinoma and 0. 89 (95% CI 0. 76-1. 03) for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	Compared with nondrinkers, the pooled RRs were 0. 86 for light (≤ 1 drink per day), 0. 90 for moderate (1 to < 4 drinks per day), and 1. 16 for heavy (≥ 4 drinks per day) alcohol drinking.
meta analysis	The dose-risk model found a minimum at 25 g/day, and the curve was < 1 up to 70 g/day.
meta analysis	Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides definite evidence of an absence of association between alcohol drinking and esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma risk, even at higher doses of consumption.
meta analysis	A meta-analysis on alcohol drinking and esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma risk
Case-control study	Background: Data from observational studies suggest that body mass index (BMI) is causally related to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, the relationships may be affected by bias and confounding.
Case-control study	Methods: We used data from the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Genetic Susceptibility Study: 999 patients with EAC, 2061 patients with BE, and 2169 population controls.
Case-control study	We applied the two-stage control function instrumental variable method of the Mendelian randomization approach to estimate the unbiased, unconfounded effect of BMI on risk of EAC and BE.
Case-control study	This was performed using a genetic risk score, derived from 29 genetic variants shown to be associated with BMI, as an instrument for lifetime BMI. A higher score indicates propensity to obesity. All tests were two-sided.
Case-control study	Results: The genetic risk score was not associated with potential confounders, including gastroesophageal reflux symptoms and smoking. In the instrumental variable analyses (IV), EAC risk increased by 16% (IV-odds ratio [OR] = 1.
Case-control study	16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1. 01 to 1. 33) and BE risk increased by 12% (IV-OR = 1. 12, 95% CI = 1. 00 to 1. 25) per 1kg/m(2) increase in BMI.
Case-control study	BMI was statistically significantly associated with EAC and BE in conventional epidemiologic analyses.
Case-control study	Conclusions: People with a high genetic propensity to obesity have higher risks of esophageal metaplasia and neoplasia than people with low genetic propensity.
Case-control study	These analyses provide the strongest evidence to date that obesity is independently associated with BE and EAC, and is not due to confounding or bias inherent in conventional epidemiologic analyses.
Case-control study	Obesity and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus: a Mendelian randomization study
meta analysis	Background: The incidence rates of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (EGCA) have increased over recent years in several countries, and overweight/obesity has been suggested to play a major role in these trends.
meta analysis	In fact, higher body mass index (BMI) has been positively associated with EGCA in several studies. Material and methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies on the BMI and EGCA updated to March 2011.
meta analysis	We estimated overall relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for BMI between 25 and 30 and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2), when compared with normo-weight subjects, using random-effects models.
meta analysis	Results: We identified 22 studies, including almost 8000 EGCA cases. The overall RR was 1. 71 (95% CI 1. 50-1. 96) for BMI between 25 and 30, and was 2. 34 (95% CI 1. 95-2. 81) for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2).
meta analysis	The continuous RR for an increment of 5 kg/m(2) of BMI was 1. 11 (95% CI 1. 09-1. 14). The association was stronger for esophageal adenocarcinoma (RR for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) = 2. 73, 95% CI 2. 16-3.
meta analysis	46) than for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (RR for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) = 1. 93, 95% CI 1. 52-2. 45). No substantial differences emerged across strata of sex and geographic areas.
meta analysis	Conclusion: Overweight and obesity are strongly related to EGCA, particularly to espophageal adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	A meta-analysis of body mass index and esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma
Case-control study	Background: The incidence of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is, for unknown reasons, increasing dramatically.
Case-control study	A weak and inconsistent association between body mass index (BMI) and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia has been reported.
Case-control study	Objective: To reexamine the association between BMI and development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia. Design: Nationwide, population-based case-control study. Setting: Sweden, 1995 through 1997.
Case-control study	Patients: Patients younger than 80 years of age who had recently received a diagnosis were eligible. Comprehensive organization ensured rapid case ascertainment. Controls were randomly selected from the continuously updated population register.
Case-control study	Interviews were conducted with 189 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and 262 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia; for comparison, 167 patients with incident esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and 820 controls were also interviewed.
Case-control study	Measurements: Odds ratios were determined from BMI and cancer case-control status.
Case-control study	Odds ratios estimated the relative risk for the two adenocarcinomas studied and were calculated by multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors.
Case-control study	Results: A strong dose-dependent relation existed between BMI and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The adjusted odds ratio was 7. 6 (95% CI, 3. 8 to 15. 2) among persons in the highest BMI quartile compared with persons in the lowest.
Case-control study	Obese persons (persons with a BMI > 30 kg/m2) had an odds ratio of 16. 2 (CI, 6. 3 to 41. 4) compared with the leanest persons (persons with a BMI < 22 kg/m2). The odds ratio for patients with cardia adenocarcinoma was 2. 3 (CI, 1. 5 to 3.
Case-control study	6) in those in the highest BMI quartile compared with those in the lowest BMI quartile and 4. 3 (CI, 2. 1 to 8. 7) among obese persons. Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not associated with BMI.
Case-control study	Conclusions: The association between BMI and esophageal adenocarcinoma is strong and is not explained by bias or confounding. The carcinogenic mechanism, however, remains to be clarified.
Case-control study	The increasing prevalence of obesity in western countries could be important in understanding the increasing occurrence of this tumor.
Case-control study	Association between body mass and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia
meta analysis	Objectives: Esophageal adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus, are increasing in incidence in western populations.
meta analysis	Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and high body mass index (BMI) are known risk factors, but it is unclear whether BMI mediates its risk on Barrett's esophagus independently.
meta analysis	This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether increasing BMI is associated with Barrett's esophagus as compared to general population and GERD controls. Methods: Search strategies were conducted in MEDLINE (U. S.
meta analysis	National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) (1966-2005) and EMBASE (Reed Elsevier PLC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (1980-2005).
meta analysis	Studies to be included were required to present "current" BMI data for consecutively recruited Barrett's esophagus patients and appropriate comparison arms with a minimum number of 30 subjects in each.
meta analysis	Results: The literature search produced 5,501 hits from which 295 papers were extracted. Only 10 studies met the criteria for inclusion. The Statistics/Data Analysis (STATA) program was used to conduct random effects meta-analyses.
meta analysis	Nine studies comparing the BMI of the Barrett's esophagus and GERD groups produced a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0. 99 per kg/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0. 97-1.
meta analysis	01, I2= 52%), while the pooled estimate of three studies comparing Barrett's esophagus with general population controls was 1. 02 per kg/m2 (95% CI 1. 01-1. 04, I2= 0%).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Increasing adiposity is only an indirect risk factor of Barrett's esophagus through the precursor lesion of GERD.
meta analysis	Hence, BMI status has no predictive value with respect to GERD patients and their risk of progression to Barrett's esophagus.
meta analysis	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of increasing adiposity on Barrett's esophagus
Case-control study	Background: Barrett's esophagus is a strong risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, but little is known about its associations with body mass index (BMI) or abdominal obesity.
Case-control study	Methods: We conducted a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population.
Case-control study	Persons with a new diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (cases) were matched to subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) without Barrett's esophagus and to population controls.
Case-control study	Subjects completed questionnaires and an anthropometric examination. Results: We interviewed 320 cases, 316 patients with GERD, and 317 controls.
Case-control study	There was a general association between Barrett's esophagus and a larger abdominal circumference (independent of BMI) compared with population controls (odds ratio, 2. 24; 95% confidence interval, 1. 21-4. 15; circumference, >80 cm vs <80 cm).
Case-control study	There was a possible risk plateau, with increased risk evident only at circumferences >80 cm and no significant trend for further increases in circumference. There was a trend for association compared with patients with GERD (test for trend, P =. 03).
Case-control study	There was no association between Barrett's esophagus and BMI. Abdominal circumference was associated with GERD symptom severity (odds ratio, 1. 86; 95% confidence interval, 1. 03-3.
Case-control study	38; risk of severe weekly GERD, per 10-cm circumference); adjustment for GERD partially attenuated the association between Barrett's esophagus and circumference.
Case-control study	Conclusions: Waist circumference, but not BMI, had some modest independent associations with the risk of Barrett's esophagus.
Case-control study	The findings provide partial support for the hypothesis that abdominal obesity contributes to GERD, which may in turn increase the risk of Barrett's esophagus.
Case-control study	Abdominal obesity and body mass index as risk factors for Barrett's esophagus
Case-control study	Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with cancer risk and increases the risk of Barrett esophagus, which is the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), primarily in the absence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Case-control study	However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding whether MetS is associated with the risk of EA.
Case-control study	Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database, the authors evaluated whether MetS was associated with EA.
Case-control study	A total of 3167 cases of EA were compared with individually matched population controls (5:1); a subset of 575 EA cases were able to be individually matched with 575 Barrett esophagus controls.
Case-control study	MetS was defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes in the period 1 to 3 years before the diagnosis of EA or control selection.
Case-control study	Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Potential effect modification by GERD symptoms and sex was examined in stratified models.
Case-control study	Results: EA was found to be significantly associated with MetS (odds ratio, 1. 16; 95% confidence interval, 1. 06-1. 26) compared with population controls.
Case-control study	In males, the association was restricted to those individuals without prior GERD; however, in females, MetS was found to be associated with EA regardless of GERD status. Effect modification by sex was observed (P for interaction =. 01).
Case-control study	MetS was not found to be associated with EA risk when compared with Barrett esophagus controls.
Case-control study	Conclusions: In this older population, MetS was found to be associated with an increased risk of EA in males without GERD and females regardless of GERD status.
Case-control study	Given the lack of an association when compared with Barrett esophagus controls, MetS may impact EA risk by primarily increasing the risk of the precursor lesion, Barrett esophagus. Cancer 2017;123:657-665. © 2016 American Cancer Society.
Case-control study	Metabolic syndrome and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in elderly patients in the United States: An analysis of SEER-Medicare data
Case-control study	Purpose: The epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway is important in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) tumorigenesis.
Case-control study	We hypothesized that the EGF A61G homozygous variant genotype (GG) is (a) both a risk and poor prognostic factor for EAC and (b) associated with higher EGF serum levels in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Case-control study	Experimental design: Using unconditional logistic regression, we compared EGF A61G in 312 EAC cases and 447 GERD-free controls, adjusting for age, gender, smoking history, and healthy adult body mass index.
Case-control study	Using the method of Kaplan and Meier, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models, we correlated EGF A61G with overall and failure-free survival in the EAC cases.
Case-control study	Serum EGF levels and EGF genotype (G/G versus others) were correlated in 144 GERD patients using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: The EGF A61G G/G genotype conferred increased EAC risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.
Case-control study	81 (95% confidence interval, 1. 2-2. 7), and was even higher in the subgroup of EAC patients with concurrent Barrett's esophagus (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 18; 95% confidence interval, 1. 3-3. 7).
Case-control study	However, EGF A61G was not associated with a more aggressive phenotype or prognosis in EAC patients. Higher serum EGF levels were found in GERD patients carrying G/G compared with A/A or A/G (P = 0. 03, Wilcoxon rank sum test).
Case-control study	Conclusion: The EGF A61G G/G genotype is associated with a near 2-fold greater risk of EAC. The G/G allele was also associated with higher EGF levels in tumor-free patients with GERD.
Case-control study	EGF genotyping can potentially identify high-risk patients with GERD and Barrett's metaplasia who might benefit from increased surveillance.
Case-control study	A functional epidermal growth factor (EGF) polymorphism, EGF serum levels, and esophageal adenocarcinoma risk and outcome
Case-control study	Background: One of the major pathophysiological abnormalities in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is thought to involve transient lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) relaxations.
Case-control study	One component of the neural mechanism controlling the LOS appears to be a reflex are whose afferent limb originates in the gastric fundus.
Case-control study	As inflammation is known to be associated with neural activation an investigation was made to determine whether gastric infection with H pylori is altered in prevalence or distribution in patients with reflux disease.
Case-control study	Methods: Five groups of subjects referred for endoscopy-group 1: 25 controls (asymptomatic individuals with anaemia and normal endoscopy); group 2: 36 subjects with erosive oesophagitis alone (Savary-Millar grades I-III); group 3: 16 subjects with duodenal ulcer alone; group 4: 15 subjects with oesophagitis with duodenal ulcer; group 5: 16 subjects with Barrett's oesophagus.
Case-control study	No patients were receiving acid suppressants or antibiotics.
Case-control study	An antral biopsy specimen was taken for a rapid urease test, and two biopsy specimens were taken from the antrum, fundus, and oesophagus (inflamed and non-inflamed) for histological evidence of inflammation and presence of H pylori using a Giemsa stain.
Case-control study	Results: Nine (36%) controls had H pylori.
Case-control study	Patients with duodenal ulcer alone had a significantly higher incidence of colonisation by H pylori than other groups (duodenal ulcer 15 (94%); oesophagitis 13 (36%); oesophagitis+duodenal ulcer 6 (40%); Barrett's oesophagus 4 (25%)).
Case-control study	H pylori was not more common in oesophagitis. When H pylori colonised the gastric antrum it was usually found in the gastric fundus. There was no difference in anatomical distribution of H pylori in the different patient groups.
Case-control study	In Barrett's oesophagus H pylori was found in two of 16 in the metaplastic epithelium.
Case-control study	Conclusion: H pylori is not more common and its distribution does not differ in those with oesophagitis compared with control subjects, and is therefore unlikely to be aetiologically important in these patients.
Case-control study	H pylori, however, can colonise Barrett's epithelium.
Case-control study	Evaluation of Helicobacter pylori in reflux oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus
Case series	A retrospective study for assessment of the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori was performed in 107 consecutive patients with columnar-lined epithelium in the esophagus. The presence of hiatal hernia and esophagitis was noted.
Case series	From 71 patients, biopsy specimens were available for analysis. No difference in the presence or absence of H. pylori was noted, regardless of whether or not there was esophagitis or hiatal hernia. Most H.
Case series	pylori-positive patients show a low bacterial load in the metaplastic epithelium. It is assumed that the finding of H. pylori in columnar-lined epithelium reflects a shift in the bacterium from the gastric antrum. H.
Case series	pylori probably has no etiologic role of esophagitis in Barrett's mucosa.
Case series	Prevalence and significance of Helicobacter pylori in patients with Barrett's esophagus
Case-control study	A prospective study was performed in 190 control subjects and in 236 patients with different degrees of endoscopic esophagitis in order to determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection at duodenal gastric and esophageal mucosa and its correlation with histological findings.
Case-control study	All patients with pathologic gastroesophageal reflux had 24-h pH monitoring studies confirming the presence of acid reflux into the esophagus.
Case-control study	Besides the endoscopic findings, biopsies were taken from the duodenal bulb, gastric antrum, gastric fundus and distal esophagus or at the specialized columnar epithelium in patients with Barrett's esophagus.
Case-control study	Patients with pathological gastroesophageal reflux were divided into three groups: 55 with absence of endoscopic esophagitis (gastroesophageal reflux), 81 patients with erosive esophagitis and 100 patients with Barrett's esophagus. There was no H.
Case-control study	pylori infection present at duodenal or esophageal mucosa or at the specialized columnar epithelium of the distal esophagus in any case. The prevalence of H.
Case-control study	pylori infection at gastric antrum was similar in controls and in any group of patients with reflux disease (20-25% of H. pylori infection). No differences in age and sex distribution were seen. H.
Case-control study	pylori infection at gastric fundus was very low (less than 5%). The presence of HP infections was correlated with the finding of chronic active superficial or athrophic gastritis while, in the absence of H. pylori infection, gastric mucosa was normal.
Case-control study	In the presence of intestinal metaplasia, no H. pylori infection occurred. Based on these findings, it seems that there is no significant evidence for an important pathogenic role for H.
Case-control study	pylori infection in the development of pathologic chronic gastroesophageal reflux, erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, and the presence of antral gastritis in patients with Barrett's esophagus is closely related to the presence of H.

Case-control study	Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in 190 control subjects and in 236 patients with gastroesophageal reflux, erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus
Case-control study	Background & aims: Whether inflammation of the cardia indicates gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and/or is a manifestation of pangastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection is unknown.
Case-control study	The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between cardia inflammation, H. pylori infection, and cardia intestinal metaplasia in patients with and without GERD.
Case-control study	Methods: Patients with GERD were compared with controls undergoing endoscopy for a variety of other conditions. Endoscopic biopsy specimens from the distal esophagus and cardia, fundus, and antrum were evaluated for inflammation, H.
Case-control study	pylori infection, and intestinal metaplasia. Results: Neither the prevalence of H. pylori infection (controls, 48%; GERD, 41%) nor cardia inflammation (controls, 41%; GERD, 40%) differed between groups.
Case-control study	All 11 controls and 22 of 23 patients with GERD (96%) and cardia inflammation had H. pylori infection. Esophagitis was more common among GERD patients (33%) than controls (7%; P = 0. 01).
Case-control study	Cardia intestinal metaplasia was more common among controls (22%) than GERD patients (3%; P = 0. 01); all had cardia inflammation, 7 had H. pylori infection, and 6 had metaplasia elsewhere in the stomach.
Case-control study	Conclusions: The prevalence of cardia inflammation is similar in patients with and without GERD and is associated with H. pylori infection (P < 0. 001). Cardia intestinal metaplasia is associated with H. pylori-related cardia inflammation (P = 0.

review	pylori infection, atrophic gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), secretion of gastric acid, and gastric motility published between 1966 and July 1997. Results: Whereas some studies have shown no significant association between H.
review	pylori infection and reflux esophagitis, others have observed that the prevalence of H. pylori infection was lower in patients with GERD, implying a protective role. Eradication of H.
review	pylori leads to occurrence of reflux esophagitis in some cases, but the mechanisms inducing posteradication reflux esophagitis are unknown. H.
review	pylori infection may lead to atrophic gastritis (and hence hypochlorhydia) through both bacterial and host factors, although gastric atrophy and subsequent intestinal metaplasia are hostile to H. pylori because of hypochlorhydria.
review	Although it has been reported that long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy for refractory reflux esophagitis may induce or enhance the development of gastric atrophy in H. pylori-infected patients, this relationship has been disputed. Conclusions: H.
review	pylori infection may be negatively associated with reflux esophagitis, but this requires confirmation. Research then needs to focus on whether this is explained through motility- or acid-related mechanisms.
review	The potential costs of maintenance antireflux therapy may need to be taken into account when evaluating the cost effectiveness of anti-H. pylori therapy.
review	Helicobacter pylori infection, reflux esophagitis, and atrophic gastritis: an unexplored triangle
Cohort study	Background & aims: We have shown previously that cure of Helicobacter pylori infection leads to the disappearance of acid-neutralizing substances. Also, patients with ulcer after cure may gain weight.
Cohort study	The aim of this study was to investigate whether cure of the infection increases the risk of reflux esophagitis.
Cohort study	Methods: Patients with duodenal ulcer without reflux esophagitis at the time of Helicobacter treatment were followed up prospectively after cure of the infection (n = 244) or after diagnosis of persisting infection (n = 216).
Cohort study	All patients underwent endoscopy at 1-year intervals or when upper gastrointestinal symptoms recurred. H. pylori infection was assessed by rapid urease test and histology. Results: The estimated incidence of reflux esophagitis within 3 years was 25.
Cohort study	8% after cure of the infection and 12. 9% when the infection was ongoing (P < 0. 001). Patients who developed reflux esophagitis after the cure had a more severe body gastritis before cure (odds ratio, 5. 5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2. 8-13.
Cohort study	6), gained weight more frequently after cure (odds ratio, 3. 2; 95% CI, 1. 2-9. 4), and were predominantly men (odds ratio, 3. 6; 95% CI, 1. 1-10. 6). Conclusions: A considerable proportion of patients with duodenal ulcer treated for H.
Cohort study	pylori will develop reflux esophagitis; risk factors are male sex, severity of corpus gastritis, and weight gain.
Cohort study	Curing Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer may provoke reflux esophagitis
Case-control study	Background & aims: The role of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is unknown. We determined the prevalence of cagA-positive (cagA+) H.
Case-control study	pylori strains in patients with GERD or its complications compared with controls of similar age.
Case-control study	Methods: A total of 153 consecutive patients with GERD, Barrett's esophagus, and Barrett's esophagus complicated by dysplasia or adenocarcinoma were compared with 57 controls who underwent upper endoscopy for reasons other than GERD. H.
Case-control study	pylori infection and CagA antibody status were determined by histology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: H. pylori prevalence was lower (34%) in patients with GERD and its sequelae than in the control group (45. 6%)(P = 0. 15).
Case-control study	Regardless of the group, increasing age was associated with higher prevalence of H. pylori (P = 0. 003). When compared with controls (42. 3%), the prevalence of cagA+ H. pylori strains decreased (P = 0.
Case-control study	008) in patients with more severe complications of GERD (GERD, 36. 7% [nonerosive GERD, 41. 2%; erosive GERD, 30. 8%]; Barrett's esophagus, 13. 3%; and Barrett's with adenocarcinoma/dysplasia, 0%). Conclusions: Prevalence of H.
Case-control study	pylori in patients with GERD and its sequelae was lower but not significantly different than that of a control group. However, patients carrying cagA+ strains of H.
Case-control study	pylori may be protected against the complications of GERD, especially Barrett's esophagus and its associated dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.
Case-control study	The seroprevalence of cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori strains in the spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux disease
Case-control study	Background: An inverse association between Helicobacter pylori infection and esophageal adenocarcinoma has been reported that may be attributed to reduced acidity from inducing atrophic gastritis and from producing ammonia.
Case-control study	We examined associations between H. pylori infection, gastric atrophy, and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in a large population-based case-control study in Sweden.
Case-control study	Methods: Self-reported data were obtained during interviews, and serum was collected from 97 patients with incident esophageal adenocarcinoma, 85 patients with incident esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, 133 patients with incident gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, and 499 randomly selected control subjects.
Case-control study	Serum antibodies against whole H. pylori cell-surface antigens (HP-CSAs) and cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) antigens were assessed by an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting, respectively.
Case-control study	Gastric atrophy was assessed by serum levels of pepsinogen I. Multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors was used to evaluate associations. Results: H.
Case-control study	pylori infection, assayed by HP-CSA or CagA antibodies, was statistically significantly associated with a reduced risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma (for HP-CSA antibodies, odds ratio [OR] = 0. 3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0. 2 to 0.
Case-control study	6; for CagA antibodies, OR = 0. 5, 95% CI = 0. 3 to 0. 8; for both, OR = 0. 2, 95% CI = 0. 1 to 0. 5). Gastric atrophy was not associated with the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1. 1, 95% CI = 0. 5 to 2. 5).
Case-control study	Serum CagA antibodies and gastric atrophy were associated with an increased risk for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (OR = 2. 1, 95% CI = 1. 1 to 4. 0, and OR = 4. 3, 95% CI = 1. 9 to 9. 6, respectively).
Case-control study	The risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma was not associated with H. pylori infection. However, gastric atrophy was associated with an increased risk for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (OR = 4. 5, 95% CI = 2. 5 to 7. 8). Conclusions: Infection with H.
Case-control study	pylori may reduce the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but it is unlikely to do so by atrophy-reduced acidity. Gastric atrophy and infection with CagA-positive strains of H. pylori may increase the risk for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.
Case-control study	Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric atrophy: risk of adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia
meta analysis	Background & aims: Helicobacter pylori is an important causative factor in gastric carcinogenesis. However, its role in extragastric gastrointestinal malignancies, such as esophageal cancer, is controversial.
meta analysis	The aim of this study was to explore the relationship of H. pylori infection and H. pylori cagA-positive strain with this malignancy by performing meta-analysis of all relevant studies.
meta analysis	Methods: Extensive MEDLINE English language medical literature searches for human studies were performed through February 2007 with suitable keywords. Pooled estimates were obtained by using fixed or random-effects model as appropriate.
meta analysis	Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with the Cochran Q test, whereas the likelihood of publication bias was assessed by constructing funnel plots. Their symmetry was estimated by the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test.
meta analysis	Results: In adenocarcinoma patients there were inverse significant relationships with both the H. pylori prevalence (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0. 52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 37-0. 73; P <. 001) and the prevalence of H.
meta analysis	pylori cagA-positive strain (pooled OR, 0. 51; 95% CI, 0. 31-0. 82; P =. 006). Similarly in patients with Barrett's esophagus there were inverse significant relationships (pooled OR, 0. 64; 95% CI, 0. 43-0. 94; P =. 025 and pooled OR, 0.
meta analysis	39; 95% CI, 0. 21-0. 76; P =. 005, respectively). In patients with squamous cell carcinoma there were no significant relationships with both H. pylori prevalence (pooled OR, 0. 85; 95% CI, 0. 55-1. 33; P =. 48) and the prevalence of H.
meta analysis	pylori cagA-positive strains (pooled OR, 1. 22; 95% CI, 0. 7-2. 13; P =. 48). Conclusions: The results showed an inverse statistically significant relationship of H.
meta analysis	pylori infection with both esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus, which might suggest a protective role of the infection in these entities. On the contrary, no statistically significant relationship with squamous cell carcinoma was found.
meta analysis	Relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and esophageal neoplasia: a meta-analysis
Case-control study	Background & aims: Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), but it is not clear whether this reduction is modified by genotype, other host characteristics, or environmental factors.
Case-control study	Furthermore, little is known about the association between H pylori and adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (EGJAC) or squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC).
Case-control study	We sought to measure the association between H pylori infection and esophageal cancer and identify potential modifiers.
Case-control study	Methods: In an Australian, population-based, case-control study, we compared the prevalence of H pylori seropositivity and single nucleotide polymorphisms in interleukin (IL)-1B (-31, -511) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (-308, -238) among 260 EAC, 298 EGJAC, and 208 ESCC patients and 1346 controls.
Case-control study	To estimate relative risks, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multivariable logistic regression in the entire sample and within strata of phenotypic and genotypic risk factors.
Case-control study	Results: H pylori infection was associated with significantly reduced risks of EAC (OR, 0. 45; 95% CI: 0. 30-0. 67) and EGJAC (OR, 0. 41; 95% CI: 0. 27-0. 60) but not ESCC (OR, 1. 04; 95% CI: 0. 71-1. 50).
Case-control study	For each cancer subtype, risks were of similar magnitude across strata of reflux frequency and smoking status. We found no evidence that polymorphisms in IL-1B or TNF-alpha modified the association between H pylori and EAC or EGJAC.
Case-control study	Conclusions: H pylori infection is inversely associated with risks of EAC and EGJAC (but not ESCC); the reduction in risk is similar across subgroups of potential modifiers.
Case-control study	Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with reduced risk for esophageal cancer is independent of environmental and genetic modifiers
Case-control study	Background: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing rapidly. Gastroesophageal reflux is a strong risk factor for this disease.
Case-control study	The increase in incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma coincided with the introduction of medications that promote reflux by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), such as nitroglycerin, anticholinergics, beta-adrenergic agonists, aminophyllines, and benzodiazepines.
Case-control study	Objective: To test the possible association between use of LES-relaxing medications and risk for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia. Design: A nationwide population-based case-control study with in-person interviews.
Case-control study	Setting: Sweden, 1995 through 1997. Patients: 189 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma, 262 with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia, and 167 with esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma were compared with 820 population-based controls.
Case-control study	Measurements: Estimated incidence rate ratios, calculated by using multivariate logistic regression from case-control data with adjustment for potential confounding.
Case-control study	Results: Past use of LES-relaxing drugs was positively associated with risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Among daily, long-term users (>5 years) of LES-relaxing drugs, the estimated incidence rate ratio was 3. 8 (95% CI, 2. 2 to 6.
Case-control study	4) compared with persons who had never used these drugs. Drugs of all classes contributed to the increased risk, but the association was particularly strong for anticholinergics.
Case-control study	Short-term use of other types of LES-relaxing drugs did not seem to be strongly associated with risk.
Case-control study	The association almost disappeared after adjustment for reflux symptoms, indicating that promotion of reflux is the link between use of LES-relaxing drugs and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case-control study	If 15,490 men in any age group take LES-relaxing drugs daily for 5 years, 1 additional case of adenocarcinoma would be expected (number needed to treat for harm); in men older than 60 years of age, the number needed to treat for harm is 5,570.
Case-control study	Assuming a causal relation, about 10% of the esophageal adenocarcinomas occurring in the population may be attributable to intake of LES-relaxing drugs.
Case-control study	Cardia adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma were not associated with use of LES-relaxing drugs. Conclusions: The widespread use of LES-relaxing drugs may have contributed to the increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case-control study	Association between medications that relax the lower esophageal sphincter and risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma
Case-control study	Objectives: Medications that may increase gastroesophageal reflux could be risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma; however, epidemiologic studies present conflicting results.
Case-control study	We evaluated patients with a high-risk condition, Barrett's esophagus, to identify risk factors that may act early in the carcinogenic process. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study within a large integrated health-services organization.
Case-control study	Electronic databases were used to identify incident diagnoses of Barrett's esophagus (cases); two controls were matched to each case.
Case-control study	Electronic databases provided information on the use of medications that may induce reflux (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, xanthines, benzodiazepines, and beta agonists) and potential confounders.
Case-control study	A supplemental mailed questionnaire evaluated additional potential confounders. Results: We identified 421 cases and selected 842 controls.
Case-control study	The association between any medication use and a Barrett's esophagus diagnosis was modified by age; an increased risk was observed only among subjects <70 yr of age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2. 6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1. 5-4. 6).
Case-control study	A Barrett's esophagus diagnosis was associated with asthma medication use (OR 5. 8; 95% CI 2. 2, 14. 9), but not with the other medications studied.
Case-control study	Subgroup analyses suggested that medication use was not independently associated with reflux symptoms and that adjustment for asthma symptoms substantially reduced the association between medication use and a Barrett's esophagus diagnosis.
Case-control study	Conclusion: The use of medications that may induce reflux was associated with a Barrett's esophagus diagnosis among younger persons.
Case-control study	This association was only observed with asthma medications; the analyses suggested the possibility of confounding by indication, whereby reflux may cause both asthma and Barrett's esophagus.
Case-control study	Barrett's esophagus and medications that relax the lower esophageal sphincter
meta analysis	Background and aims: Human papilloma virus (HPV), which may reach the esophagus through orogenital transmission, has been postulated to be associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
meta analysis	A systematic review of the literature investigating the prevalence of infectious agents in EAC and Barrett's esophagus (BE) was carried out.
meta analysis	Methods: Using terms for viruses and EAC, the Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies published, in any language, until June 2016 that assessed the prevalence of viral agents in EAC or BE.
meta analysis	Random-effects meta-analyses of proportions were carried out to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of infections in EAC and BE. Results: A total of 30 studies were included.
meta analysis	The pooled prevalence of HPV in EAC tumor samples was 13% (n=19 studies, 95% CI: 2-29%) and 26% (n=6 studies, 95% CI: 3-59%) in BE samples.
meta analysis	HPV prevalence was higher in EAC tissue than in esophageal tissue from healthy controls (n=5 studies, pooled odds ratio=3. 31, 95% CI: 1. 15-9. 50). The prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in EAC was 6% (n=5, 95% CI: 0-27%).
meta analysis	Few studies have assessed other infectious agents. For each of the analyses, considerable between-study variation was observed (I=84-96%); however, sensitivity analyses did not show any major sources of heterogeneity.
meta analysis	Conclusion: The prevalence of HPV and EBV in EAC is low compared with other viral-associated cancers, but may have been hampered by small sample sizes and detection methods susceptible to fixation processes.
meta analysis	Additional research with adequate sample sizes and high-quality detection methods is required.
meta analysis	The prevalence of viral agents in esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus: a systematic review
Case series	Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been reported in squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus and has been recently described in Barrett's oesophagus, a premalignant condition which may give rise to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Objectives: To investigate HPV infection in Barrett's oesophagus in a UK population. Study design: DNA was extracted from 73 Barrett's oesophagus biopsies and examined for the presence of DNA for 14 high risk (HR) and 6 low risk (LR) HPV types.
Case series	Results: HPV DNA was present in only 1 of 73 samples; genotyping indicated this was a high risk type 51 infection. Conclusions: HPV infection appears unlikely to be a significant factor in the aetiology of Barrett's oesophagus in the UK.
Case series	Human papillomavirus infection in Barrett's oesophagus in the UK: an infrequent event
Case-control study	Barrett's esophagus (BE), a known precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma has recently been associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). p16(INK4a) expression is a recognized surrogate marker of HPV infection in the cervix.
Case-control study	Objectives: This study has assessed the possible role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma, in the North American population by screening esophageal tissues for HPV by a combination of assays.
Case-control study	Study design: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks from cases of Barrett's esophagus (n=84), esophageal adenocarcinoma (n=36) and normal gastro-esophageal junction (n=29) were examined for HPV by PCR, chromogenic in situ hybridization, and p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry.
Case-control study	Results: HPV DNA was detected by PCR in 23 of 84 (27. 4%) BE cases, 11 of 36 (31%) cases of adenocarcinoma and in 7 of 29 (24%) normal control cases (p=0. 82).
Case-control study	p16(INK4a) staining was positive in 10 (12%) cases of BE, 15 (42%) cases of adenocarcinoma and 6 (21%) cases of the control group.
Case-control study	Positive p16(INK4a) staining was not statistically different between the three groups whether positive or negative for HPV DNA (p=0. 91 and p=0. 91 respectively).
Case-control study	Similarly, negative p16(INK4a) staining did not show a difference between the three groups for whether positive or negative for HPV DNA (p=0. 50 and p=0. 28, respectively).
Case-control study	HPV was not detected by CISH in the adenocarcinomas while in BE and control groups, CISH was non-contributory.
Case-control study	Conclusions: These data suggest that while HPV is detectable in a subset of esophageal lesions and tumors, the HPV detected is unlikely to be of etiologic significance or a factor accounting for the increase in BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma cases in the United States.
Case-control study	Human papillomavirus is detectable in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal carcinoma but is unlikely to be of any etiologic significance
Case series	We have previously demonstrated that transcriptionally active high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) is strongly incriminated in Barrett's dysplasia (BD) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) using mainly fresh frozen tissue.
Case series	This study aimed to identify biomarkers of active HPV infection in Barrett's metaplasia, (BM)/BD/OAC by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue for aberrations of p53 and the retinoblastoma (pRb) pathway, which are targets for the viral oncoproteins, E6/E7, respectively.
Case series	Prospectively, BM (n = 81)/BD (n = 72)/OAC (n = 65) FFPE specimens were subjected to IHC staining for pRb, p16INK4A , cyclin D1 , p53 and RNA in-situ hybridization for E6/E7 transcripts. HPV DNA was determined via PCR in fresh frozen specimens.
Case series	Viral load measurement (real-time PCR) and Next Generation Sequencing of TP53 was performed. Of 218 patients, 56 were HPV DNA positive [HPV16 (n = 42), 18 (n = 13), 6 (n = 1)]. Viral load was low.
Case series	Transcriptionally active HPV (DNA+ /RNA+ ) was only found in the dysplastic and adenocarcinoma group (n = 21). The majority of HPV DNA+ /RNA+ BD/OAC were characterized by p 16highINK4A (14/21, 66. 7%), pRblow (15/21, 71.
Case series	4%) and p53low (20/21, 95%) and was significantly different to controls [combination of HPV DNA- /RNA- (n = 94) and HPV DNA+ /RNA- cohorts (n = 22)]. p53low had the strongest association with DNA+ /RNA+ oesophageal lesions (OR = 23. 5, 95% CI = 2.
Case series	94-187. 8, p = 0. 0029). Seventeen HPV DNA+ /RNA+ BD/OAC identified as p53low, were sequenced and all but one exhibited wild-type status. pRblow /p53low provided the best balance of strength of association (OR = 8. 0, 95% CI = 2. 6-25. 0, p = 0.
Case series	0003) and sensitivity (71. 4%)/specificity (71. 6%) for DNA+ /RNA+ BD/OAC. Active HPV involvement in BD/OAC is characterized by wild-type p53 and aberrations of the retinoblastoma protein pathway.
Case series	Active human papillomavirus involvement in Barrett's dysplasia and oesophageal adenocarcinoma is characterized by wild-type p53 and aberrations of the retinoblastoma protein pathway
Case series	Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) has been implicated in a subset of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC).
Case series	We therefore hypothesised that HPV associated OAC may have distinct genomic aberrations compared with viral negative oesophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed to explore the mutational landscape and potential molecular signature of HPV-positive versus HPV-negative OAC.
Case series	Four hr-HPV-positive and 8 HPV-negative treatment-naive fresh-frozen OAC tissue specimens and matched normal tissue were analysed to identify somatic genomic mutations. Data were subjected to cancer driver gene identification and pathway analysis.
Case series	Results: The HPV-positive cohort harboured approximately 50% less non-silent somatic mutations than the virus-negative patients with oesophageal cancer (1. 31 mutations/Mb vs 2. 56 mutations/Mb, p=0. 048).
Case series	TP53 aberrations were absent in the HPV-positive OAC group whereas 50% of the HPV-negative patients with OAC exhibited TP53 mutations. HPV-negative cancers were enriched with non-silent mutations in cancer driver genes, but not HPV-positive tumours.
Case series	Enriched A>C transversions at adenine-adenine (AA) dinucleotide was observed in 5/7 Siewert class I OAC samples but none (0/5) in Siewert class II tumours (p=0. 027).
Case series	Conclusions: These findings demonstrate distinct genomic differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OACs indicating different biological mechanisms of tumour formation.
Case series	Genomic analysis of HPV-positive versus HPV-negative oesophageal adenocarcinoma identifies a differential mutational landscape
Cohort study	Background & aims: Barrett's esophagus, which is linked to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, is associated with reflux of bile. Duodenogastric reflux is increased after cholecystectomy.
Cohort study	This study aims to evaluate if cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Cohort study	Methods: A population-based cohort study of cholecystectomized patients in Sweden between 1965 and 1997 cross-linked with the Swedish Cancer Register.
Cohort study	Results: Cholecystectomized patients had an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1. 3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 0-1. 8).
Cohort study	Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not found to be associated with cholecystectomy (SIR, 0. 9; 95% CI, 0. 7-1. 1).
Cohort study	Patients with gallstone disease on whom surgery was not performed did not have an increased risk of adenocarcinoma or squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Cholecystectomy is associated with a moderately increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, possibly by the toxic effect of refluxed duodenal juice on the esophageal mucosa.
Cohort study	Further studies are needed regarding the link between bile reflux and esophageal carcinogenesis.
Cohort study	Association between cholecystectomy and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
Case series	Background: Saliva has a high nitrite concentration, derived from the enterosalivary recirculation of dietary nitrate, and is the main source of nitrite entering the acidic stomach.
Case series	Acidification of nitrite in the presence of secondary amines or amides generates potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. The reaction is inhibited by ascorbic acid and catalysed by thiocyanate.
Case series	Aim: To determine whether there is intragastric regional variation in the chemical conditions promoting luminal nitrosation following nitrate ingestion.
Case series	Methods: Using microdialysis probes, we measured concentrations of nitrite, ascorbic acid, total vitamin C, and thiocyanate simultaneously in saliva, the distal oesophagus, cardia, and the proximal and distal stomach of 17 healthy volunteers before and following intragastric nitrate (2 mmol) administration.
Case series	Results: The median pH in the distal oesophagus, cardia, and proximal and distal stomach were 7, 2. 6, 1. 9, and 1. 7, respectively, before, and were similar following nitrate administration.
Case series	Mean nitrite concentration in the distal oesophagus was similar to that of saliva, being 29. 1 micro M and 36. 7 micro M, respectively, before nitrate and increasing to 181. 6 micro M and 203. 3 micro M after nitrate ingestion.
Case series	Within the stomach, mean (SEM) nitrite concentration following nitrate was higher in the cardia (45. 5 (12. 7) micro M) than in the mid (7. 8 (3. 1)) (p<0. 01) or distal (0. 8 (0. 6)) (p<0.
Case series	1) stomach, and ascorbic acid concentration was lower at the cardia (13. 0 (6. 1)) than in the mid (51 (19. 2)) (p<0. 02) or distal (86 (29)) (p<0. 01) stomach. Consequently, the median ascorbic acid to nitrite ratio was lowest at the cardia (0.
Case series	3) (p<0. 01) versus the mid (7. 8) or distal (40) stomach. Thiocyanate concentration was similar throughout the stomach.
Case series	Conclusions: The conditions favouring luminal generation of N-nitroso compounds from dietary nitrate are maximal at the most proximal cardia region of the acidic stomach and may contribute to the high incidence of mutagenesis at this site.
Case series	Conditions for acid catalysed luminal nitrosation are maximal at the gastric cardia
Case-control study	Background & aims: Recent data show that salivary nitrites form carcinogenic nitrosamines, especially at the gastric cardia. Wheat fiber has been shown to neutralize such mutagen formation.
Case-control study	Our aim was to evaluate the association between dietary fiber and cancers of the esophageal and gastric cardia.
Case-control study	Methods: We examined data from a large-scale population-based case-control study of risk factors for adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia and esophagus and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case-control study	Results: We found a strong dose-dependent inverse association between total dietary fiber intake and risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, which was driven mainly by intake of cereal fiber.
Case-control study	The odds ratio among individuals in the highest quartile of cereal fiber intake compared with the lowest was 0. 3 (95% confidence interval, 0. 2-0. 5; P trend < 0. 0001).
Case-control study	High intake of cereal fiber was also associated with a moderately decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but no linear dose-risk trend was observed. There was no association between dietary fiber and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Case-control study	Conclusions: High intake of cereal fiber may significantly lower the risk of gastric cardia cancer.
Case-control study	Inverse association between intake of cereal fiber and risk of gastric cardia cancer
Case-control study	Incidence rates for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia have been rising rapidly.
Case-control study	We examined nutrient intake as a risk factor for esophageal and gastric cancers in a population-based case-control study in Connecticut, New Jersey, and western Washington state.
Case-control study	Interviews were completed for cases with histologically confirmed esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 282), adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia (n = 255), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 206), and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 352), along with population controls (n = 687).
Case-control study	Associations between nutrient intake and risk of cancer were estimated by adjusted odds ratios (ORs), comparing the 75th versus the 25th percentile of intake.
Case-control study	The following nutrients were significantly inversely associated with risk of all four tumor types: fiber, beta-carotene, folate, and vitamins C and B6.
Case-control study	In contrast, dietary cholesterol, animal protein, and vitamin B12 were significantly positively associated with risk of all four tumor types. Dietary fat [OR, 2. 18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1. 27-3.
Case-control study	76] was significantly associated with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma only. Dietary nitrite (OR, 1. 65; 95% CI, 1. 26-2. 16) was associated with noncardia gastric cancer only.
Case-control study	Vitamin C supplement use was associated with a significantly lower risk for noncardia gastric cancer (OR, 0. 60; 95% CI, 0. 41-0. 88).
Case-control study	Higher intake of nutrients found primarily in plant-based foods was associated with a reduced risk of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia, whereas higher intake of nutrients found primarily in foods of animal origin was associated with an increased risk.
Case-control study	Nutrient intake and risk of subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer
meta analysis	While several epidemiological studies have investigated the association between vitamin C and risk of esophageal cancer, the results remain inconsistent.
meta analysis	In the present study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of dietary vitamin C intake on esophageal cancer risk.
meta analysis	Online databases were searched up to March 29, 2015, for studies on the association between dietary vitamin C intake and esophageal cancer risk.
meta analysis	Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model.
meta analysis	Dose-response analyses were performed using the method of restricted cubic splines with four knots at percentiles of 5, 35, 65 and 95% of the distribution. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's tests and funnel plots.
meta analysis	In all, 15 articles were included in this meta-analysis, including 20 studies, containing 7063 controls and 3955 cases of esophageal cancer. By comparing the highest vs.
meta analysis	the lowest categories of vitamin C intake, we found that vitamin C was inversely associated with the risk of esophageal cancer [overall OR = 0. 58, 95% CI = 0. 49-0. 68, I(2) = 56%]. A linear dose-response relationship was found.
meta analysis	With an increase in dietary vitamin C intake of 50 mg/day, the risk of esophageal cancer statistically decreased by 13% (OR = 0. 87, 95% CI = 0. 80-0. 93, p(linearity) = 0. 0002).
meta analysis	In conclusion, our analysis suggested that the higher intake of dietary vitamin C might have a protective effect against esophageal cancer.

Case-control study	Objective: The present study evaluated the associations among antioxidants, fruit and vegetable intake, and the risk of Barrett's esophagus (BE), a potential precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case-control study	Methods: We conducted a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population.
Case-control study	Incident BE cases (N = 296) were matched to persons with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (GERD controls N = 308) and to population controls (N = 309). Nutrient intake was measured using a validated 110-item food frequency questionnaire.
Case-control study	The antioxidant results were stratified by dietary versus total intake of antioxidants.
Case-control study	Results: Comparing cases to population controls, dietary intake of vitamin C and beta-carotene were inversely associated with the risk of BE (4th vs 1st quartile, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0. 48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0. 26-0. 90; OR 0.
Case-control study	56, 95% CI 0. 32-0. 99, respectively), and the inverse association was strongest for vitamin E (OR 0. 25, 95% CI 0. 11-0. 59).
Case-control study	The inverse trends for antioxidant index (total and dietary) and fruit and vegetable intake were statistically significant, while most total intakes were not associated with reduced risk.
Case-control study	The use of antioxidant supplements did not influence the risk of BE, and antioxidants and fruits and vegetables were inversely associated with a GERD diagnosis.
Case-control study	Conclusion: Dietary antioxidants, fruits, and vegetables are inversely associated with the risk of BE, while no association was observed for supplement intake.
Case-control study	Our results suggest that fruits and vegetables themselves or associated undetected confounders may influence early events in the carcinogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

meta analysis	Background & aims: Regular use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been reported to reduce risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (EGJA).
meta analysis	However, individual studies have been too small to accurately assess the effects of medication type, frequency, or duration of use. We performed a pooled analysis to investigate these associations.
meta analysis	Methods: We performed a pooled analysis of 6 population-based studies within the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium to evaluate the association between NSAID use and the risk of EAC and EGJA, using uniform exposure definitions.
meta analysis	We collected information from 6 studies (5 case-control and 1 cohort), with a total of 1226 EAC and 1140 EGJA cases, on aspirin and/or NSAID use.
meta analysis	Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariate adjusted logistic regression models and then pooled using a random effects meta-analysis model.
meta analysis	Results: Compared with nonusers, individuals who have used NSAIDs had a statistically significant reduced risk of EAC (OR, 0. 68; 95% CI, 0. 56-0. 83); they also appeared to have a reduced risk of EGJA (OR, 0. 83; 95% CI, 0. 66-1. 03).
meta analysis	Similar reductions in risk were observed among individuals who took aspirin or nonaspirin NSAIDs.
meta analysis	The highest levels of frequency (daily or more frequently) and duration (≥10 years) of NSAID use were associated with an approximately 40% reduction in risk of EAC, with ORs of 0. 56 (95% CI, 0. 43-0. 73; P(trend) <. 001) and 0. 63 (95% CI, 0. 45-0.
meta analysis	90; P(trend) =. 04), respectively.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Although reverse causation could, in part, explain the inverse association observed between NSAID use and EAC risk, our pooled analysis suggests a possible role for NSAIDs in prevention of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction.

randomized controlled trial	Background: Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition that is a risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a disease whose incidence is rapidly increasing.
randomized controlled trial	Because aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib, may decrease the risk of developing esophageal cancer, we investigated the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Chemoprevention for Barrett's Esophagus Trial (CBET) is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus and low- or high-grade dysplasia.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo, both administered orally twice daily, and then stratified by grade of dysplasia.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia between the celecoxib and placebo arms.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary and tertiary outcomes included evaluation of changes in histology and expression levels of relevant biomarkers. All statistical tests were two-sided.
randomized controlled trial	Results: From April 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, 222 patients were registered into CBET, and 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett's dysplasia were randomly assigned to treatment (49 to celecoxib and 51 to placebo).
randomized controlled trial	After 48 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia or cancer between treatment groups in either the low-grade (median change with celecoxib = -0.
randomized controlled trial	09, interquartile range [IQR] = -0. 32 to 0. 14 and with placebo = -0. 07, IQR = -0. 26 to 0. 12; P =. 64) or high-grade (median change with celecoxib = 0. 12, IQR = -0. 31 to 0. 55, and with placebo = 0. 02, IQR = -0. 24 to 0. 28; P =. 88) stratum.
randomized controlled trial	No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the Barrett's esophagus; in prostaglandin levels; in cyclooxygenase-1/2 mRNA levels; or in methylation of tumor suppressor genes p16, adenomatous polyposis coli, and E-cadherin were found with celecoxib compared with placebo.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Administration of 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett's dysplasia to cancer.

Case-control study	One hundred twenty-nine adenocarcinomas involving the esophagus and/or gastric cardia differed significantly from 212 cancers of the rest of the stomach as follows: male-female ratio, 6:1 versus 2:1, birth outside Canada, US or UK, 12% versus 34%; parent or sibling with gastric cancer, 5% versus 13%; previous duodenal ulcer, 23% versus 9%; chronic reflux symptoms, 25% versus 3%; hiatal hernia, 51% versus 11%.
Case-control study	Of the 129 esophagocardia cancers, 24 involved the esophagus alone, 48 the cardia and esophagus, 33 the cardia alone or cardia and fundus, and 24 the upper stomach and lower esophagus extensively. Thirty-four were associated with Barrett's esophagus.
Case-control study	The 72 patients with involvement of both the upper stomach and lower esophagus (48 cardia and esophagus, 24 extensive) were identical with the esophagocardia group as a whole.
Case-control study	The 24 patients with esophageal cancer and the 34 with Barrett's epithelium were the same clinically as the whole esophagocardia group except more had chronic reflux and hiatal hernia.
Case-control study	The 33 patients with cancer confined to the cardia or cardia and fundus resembled the whole esophagocardia group but did not have Barrett's esophagus.
Case-control study	Adenocarcinoma of the esophagocardia region is probably a different disease from cancer of the rest of the stomach.
Case-control study	Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and/or gastric cardia
Cross-sectional study	Objective: No prior studies have contrasted esophageal and gastric cardia carcinoma incidence rates among multiple ethnicities.
Cross-sectional study	We evaluated whether these adjacent cancers differ; such detailed demographic analyses would inform risk factor, screening, and intervention studies.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: We contrasted incidence rates and temporal trends from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data between 1992 and 1998 for five groups: non-Hispanic whites (Caucasians), white Hispanics (Hispanics), blacks, Asians/Pacific Islanders (Asians/PI), and Native Americans (NA).
Cross-sectional study	Results: Caucasian males' esophageal adenocarcinoma rate (4. 2 per 100,000 population/yr) was double that of Hispanics and four-fold higher than those of blacks, Asians/PI, and NA (p < 0. 01).
Cross-sectional study	Female rates were much lower than male rates for all ethnicities. Similar to esophageal adenocarcinoma, cardia adenocarcinoma rates were highest in Caucasian males (3.
Cross-sectional study	4 per 100,000 population/yr); however, the ethnic differences were much less and female rates were comparable for all almost all ethnicities (range 0. 6-0. 7 per 100,000 population/yr) except NA.
Cross-sectional study	Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence rates increased significantly only in Caucasians (males 5. 6%/yr, females 9%/yr; p < 0. 05) and cardia cancer rates did not increase for any ethnicity during this period.
Cross-sectional study	In contrast, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence rates were highest in blacks (8. 8 per 100,000 population/yr) and Asians/PI (3. 9 per 100,000 population/yr) and rates were stable or declined for all ethnicities between 1992 and 1998.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Esophageal and cardia carcinoma incidence rates vary much more markedly by ethnicity and gender than previously reported and the two sites differ from each other.
Cross-sectional study	Current putative risk factors do not adequately explain these large differences. These data have implications for risk factor, screening, and intervention studies.

Cohort study	Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the prognosis of patients with T1 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with those with T1 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and to explain prognostic differences by an analysis of clinicopathologic characteristics.
Cohort study	Methods: Seventy-seven patients with early esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy from 1982 to 1993 were included in the study.
Cohort study	Clinical and histopathologic characteristics, patterns of lymph node metastasis, results of surgery, and long term prognosis of 47 patients with SCC were compared with 30 patients with adenocarcinoma; a multivariate analysis of various prognostic factors was performed.
Cohort study	Results: The groups with adenocarcinoma and SCC were comparable regarding age, postoperative 90-day mortality (6. 6% vs. 8. 5%), infiltration of submucosa (74. 5% vs. 80%), and rate of lymph node metastasis (17% vs. 16. 6%).
Cohort study	Cancer limited to the mucosa was not associated with lymph node metastasis in either group, whereas submucosal spread showed lymph node involvement in 21% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 26% of those with SCC.
Cohort study	The 5-year survival rate of patients with complete tumor removal was superior for those with adenocarcinoma (82. 5%) compared with those with SCC (59. 2%) (P < 0. 03). Multivariate analysis indicated that the histopathologic type (adenocarcinoma vs.
Cohort study	SCC) was the only independent prognostic factor. The unfavorable prognosis of patients with T1 SCC was due to a higher recurrence rate and the more frequent development of second primary tumors (21% vs. 0%).
Cohort study	Conclusions: The prognosis of patients with early esophageal cancer depends on the histologic tumor type. Patients with T1 SCC should be examined for another primary cancer before surgery and during follow-up.
Cohort study	Prognosis of early esophageal cancer. Comparison between adeno- and squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Background: Linxian, China, has one of the highest rates of esophageal cancer in the world.
Case series	To design a logical biopsy strategy for large-scale endoscopic surveys in Linxian, the aim of this study was to determine whether squamous dysplasia and early squamous cancer are associated with visible lesions that can be targeted for biopsy.
Case series	Methods: Sixty-three Linxian patients with balloon cytological evidence of squamous dysplasia or early cancer of the esophagus had biopsy specimens taken every 4 cm and additional specimens taken from all visually abnormal areas.
Case series	The appearance of the 398 biopsy sites was described, and abnormal-appearing areas were photographed. The endoscopic descriptions were then compared with the biopsy diagnoses.
Case series	Results: Twenty-five of 31 (81%) moderately dysplastic or worse specimens (including all nine specimens of invasive cancer) came from visually abnormal sites classified as friability, focal red area, erosion, plaque, or nodule.
Case series	Fifteen of 16 (94%) patients with moderate dysplasia or worse biopsy diagnoses would have been identified if only these visible target lesions had been sampled.
Case series	Conclusions: For surveillance in this high-risk population, random biopsy specimens may be unnecessary; sampling the target lesions described appears sufficient to detect nearly all invasive cancer and most dysplasia.
Case series	Awareness of these lesion appearances may also aid in earlier detection of squamous cancers of the esophagus in lower-risk populations such as those in Europe and North America.

review	Tissue staining during endoscopy (chromoendoscopy) is a technique used to study the fine details of the mucosa throughout the gastrointestinal tract.
review	Unfortunately, its applications and results are not known by many gastrointestinal or surgical endoscopists. Each stain has a few specific clinical applications. The mechanism of action of the stains should be fully understood before their use.
review	Ideally, the clinician should use chromoendoscopy and the variety of stains either to confirm a clinical suspicion or to provide new information that could aid management in a specific setting.
review	Endoscopic tattooing is a different technique where a specific site in the gastrointestinal tract is labeled by an intramural injection of a carbon ink suspension solution for future surgical or endoscopic identification.
review	Chromoendoscopy--where is it useful?
review	There have been many new developments in our understanding of esophageal carcinoma biology over the past several years.
review	Information regarding both of the major forms of this disease, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, has accumulated in conjunction with data on precursor conditions such as Barrett's esophagus.
review	Some of the most interesting and promising findings have included aneuploidy (abnormal DNA content), amplification and overexpression of proto-oncogenes, loss of heterozygosity at multiple chromosomal loci, and tumor suppressor gene inactivation.
review	Of particular importance is mutation and deletion involving the tumor suppressor gene p53, but abnormalities in the retinoblastoma, deleted in colon cancer, and adenomatous polyposis coli genes have been described as well.
review	Recently, two important cancer pathways implicated in the genesis of multiple tumor types have also been inculpated in esophageal carcinogenesis: the cyclin kinase inhibitor cascade and the DNA mismatch repair process.
review	Alterations in the p16 and p15 cyclin kinase inhibitors, including point mutation and homozygous deletion, have been reported in primary esophageal tumors and/or tumor-derived cell lines.
review	Microsatellite instability, the hallmark of DNA mismatch repair defects, has been detected in esophageal cancers, particularly those associated with Barrett's metaplasia (where it may represent an early event).
review	Further developments in the field of molecular carcinogenesis of esophageal malignancies promise to yield improvements in the early detection, prognostic categorization, and perhaps eventual gene-based therapy of this deadly disease.
review	The molecular biology of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Approximately half of the patients diagnosed with localized esophageal cancer die of metastatic disease within the first 2 years following tumor resection.
Case series	The development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against epithelial cell-associated and tumor antigens has enabled the detection of single disseminated tumor cells in secondary organs.
Case series	Purpose: We used MAbs directed against epithelial cell antigens (i. e. , cytokeratins) to determine the proportion of patients with esophageal cancer who display isolated tumor cells in their bone marrow.
Case series	In addition, we evaluated the prognostic significance of a finding of bone marrow tumor cells in patients with esophageal cancer whose tumors were completely resected.
Case series	Methods: Prior to the initiation of treatment, bone marrow was aspirated from both sides of the upper iliac crests of 90 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	Bone marrow was also obtained from a population of 30 individuals who had not been diagnosed with cancer.
Case series	Tumor cells in cytologic bone marrow preparations were detected by use of an assay that employed the MAbs CK2 (directed against cytokeratin 18), KL1 (directed against a 56,000-kd pan-cytokeratin component), and A45-B/B3 (directed against an epitope common to cytokeratins 8, 18, and 19) plus the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatasestaining method.
Case series	Bone marrow biopsies, for conventional histologic examination with Giemsa staining, were performed on 62 patients.
Case series	The Kaplan-Meier method and the logrank test were used to assess disease-free and overall survival according to the presence or absence of tumor cells in the bone marrow of 42 patients with completely resected tumors. Reported P values are two-sided.
Case series	Results: Cytokeratin-positive tumor cells were detected in the bone marrow of 37 (41. 1%) of the 90 total patients. The number of tumor cells detected per 10(5) mononuclear bone marrow cells ranged from one to 82.
Case series	No significant differences in the numbers of disseminated tumor cells were noted for patients diagnosed with tumors at different stages. Only two (3.
Case series	2%) of 62 bone marrow specimens examined after Giemsa staining showed morphologically identifiable tumor cells. Tumor cells were not detected in the bone marrow of patients who had not been diagnosed with cancer. After a median follow-up of 15.
Case series	5 months (range, 6-33 months), 15 (79. 0%) of 19 patients with completely resected tumors and tumor cells in their bone marrow had relapses compared with three (13.
Case series	0%) of 23 patients with completely resected tumors and no tumor cells in their bone marrow (P =. 019, logrank test).
Case series	Patients with completely resected tumors and tumor cells in their bone marrow had significantly shorter overall survival than corresponding patients without tumor cells in their bone marrow (P =. 036, logrank test).
Case series	Conclusions and implications: Dissemination of esophageal cancer cells to the bone marrow is more frequent than expected from the rare occurrence of overt skeletal metastases.
Case series	In general, the presence of tumor cells in the bone marrow may be an indicator of the disseminatory potential of individual tumors.
Case series	Immunocytochemical detection of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background & aims: Barrett's esophagus is associated with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.
Case series	Methods: Consecutive, freshly resected surgical esophagogastrectomy specimens were examined, and multiple histological sections were made around the tumor periphery.
Case series	Barrett's esophagus was defined as specialized columnar epithelium above the esophagogastric junction. Tumors centered < or = 2 cm from the junction were defined as junction cancers.
Case series	Results: Barrett's esophagus was found in 9 of 9 (100%) esophageal adenocarcinomas compared with 0 of 8 (0%) squamous carcinoma controls (P < 0. 001). Ten of 24 (42%) junction adenocarcinomas had a Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	A Barrett's esophagus was found in 8 of 12 (67%) junction cancers < or = 6 cm in length but only 2 of 12 (17%) larger tumors (P < 0. 05).
Case series	Barrett's esophagus was significantly associated with junction tumors < 6 cm compared with squamous carcinoma controls (P < 0. 02).
Case series	In 5 specimens with junction cancer, the length of Barrett's esophagus was < 3 cm, and in 5 specimens it was > or = 3 cm. Specialized epithelium was often found below the esophagogastric junction in controls.
Case series	Conclusions: Adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction are associated with short and long segments of Barrett's esophagus. Larger cancers probably overgrow and conceal the underlying specialized columnar epithelium from which they arise.
Case series	Adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction and Barrett's esophagus
Case series	Numerous reviews of adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus have been reported, but detailed pathologic findings or survival analysis have rarely been provided.
Case series	This retrospective study analyzed 67 patients (mean age, 64 years; male-to-female ratio, 10:1) with an adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus treated by surgical resection.
Case series	Prevalence of smokers was 63%, alcohol users, 45%, and patients with hiatal hernia, 73%. Five patients had another synchronous cancer, and seven patients, previous esophageal surgery.
Case series	Forty percent of the tumors were well differentiated, 31% moderately differentiated, 15% poorly differentiated, 7% mucinous, and 6% composed of signet-ring cells.
Case series	Depth of invasion in the esophageal wall was limited to mucosa in 13% of cases and submucosa in 18%. Invasive adenocarcinomas extended to the muscular layer in 12% of cases, to adventitia in 33%, and to periesophageal tissue in 24%.
Case series	Vascular and perineural neoplastic invasion was present in 67 and 38% of cases. Regional lymph node involvement and distant metastases were found in 51 and 9% of cases. Overall, 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 63, 41, and 32%, respectively.
Case series	Five-year survival rate was significantly better for patients with superficial cancer limited to mucosa or submucosa (82 vs. 12%) or without regional lymph node involvement (59 vs. 10%).
Case series	Tumor differentiation, vascular and perineural invasion, extranodal spread, distant metastases, and resection margins status also had a significant prognostic value on univariate analysis.
Case series	In a multivariate Cox regression analysis for overall survival, depth of invasion in the esophageal wall and regional lymph node involvement were independent prognostic factors.
Case series	Careful pathologic staging is of value in determining the prognosis of patients with adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Surgical pathology of adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus. Analysis of 67 cases
Case series	Objective: To evaluate differences in clinical appearance and survival rates in patients operated on for adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus with and without Barrett epithelium. Design: Prospective clinical study.
Case series	Setting: University hospital, Sweden. Patients: Fifty-four patients with adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus with (n = 17) or without (n = 37) Barrett epithelium. Intervention: Esophagectomy or total gastrectomy.
Case series	Main outcome measures: Preoperative symptoms, endoscopic results, and histological findings; postoperative morbidity, mortality, and survival rates.
Case series	Results: The main indication for the endoscopic examination that revealed tumor in the group with Barrett esophagus was reflex-related symptoms in 6 patients (routine Barrett examination, n = 4; symptoms of reflux, n = 2), symptoms related to upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in 6, and malignant symptoms in 5 (dysphagia, n = 4; weight loss, n = 1).
Case series	In contrast, most patients in the cardia cancer group were admitted because of malignant symptoms (dysphagia, n = 26; epigastric pain, n = 9; and anemia, n = 2).
Case series	Ten of 17 patients in the Barrett esophagus cancer group had tumors limited to the mucosa and submucosa only. In 1 patient the tumor grew into the muscular layer but not through it.
Case series	In the remaining 6 patients the tumor did grow through the muscular layer and lymph node metastases were found. Wall penetration was found in 30 patients and metastases to lymph nodes in 29 patients in the cardia cancer group.
Case series	The hospital mortality rate was 0 of 17 patients in the Barrett cancer group and 2 of 37 patients in the cardia cancer group.
Case series	In the patients operated on for adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus, a better long-term survival rate was seen in those with Barrett epithelium (50%) than in those without this metaplasia (10%) (log rank P =. 005; X2 = 7. 80).
Case series	Conclusions: Concomitant Barrett epithelium improved the prognosis for patients with adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus.
Case series	Probably the reason for this was a higher rate of early-stage disease, because symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and other benign disorders, not dysphagia, were most common in patients with adenocarcinoma without Barrett epithelium in the distal esophagus.
Case series	Adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus with and without Barrett esophagus. Differences in symptoms and survival rates
Cohort study	Previous investigators have reported that in patients with esophageal carcinoma tumor cell type affects prognosis.
Cohort study	A retrospective analysis of 258 patients, from 1985 to 1991, undergoing curative esophagogastrectomy for adenocarcinoma (n = 134) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 124) was performed to test the hypothesis that histologic cell type is an independent prognostic factor and to identify other predictors of survival after resection.
Cohort study	The actuarial overall survival (p = 0. 16) and disease-specific survival (p = 0. 68) were similar for adenocarcinoma (median overall survival = 27 months) and squamous cell carcinoma (median overall survival = 22 months).
Cohort study	Univariate analysis identified T stage, N stage, number of diseased nodes, tumor differentiation, tumor site, and blood transfusions as significant (p < 0. 05) variables in predicting overall survival.
Cohort study	The presence of Barrett's esophagus was not predictive of survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that T stage (p = 0. 006), N stage (p = 0. 01), and number of diseased lymph nodes (p = 0. 03) were independent predictors of overall survival.
Cohort study	This analysis demonstrated that histologic type is not an independent variable for overall survival in patients undergoing curative esophagogastrectomy for carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.
Cohort study	Outcome is most strongly influenced by extent of disease defined by T and N stage.
Cohort study	Carcinoma of the esophagus. Prognostic significance of histologic type
Case-control study	Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) account for >95% of esophageal malignancies and represent a major global health burden.
Case-control study	ESCC is the dominant histology globally but represents a minority of U. S. cases, with EAC accounting for the majority of U. S. Cases: The patient outcomes for advanced ESCC and EAC are poor, and new therapeutic options are needed.
Case-control study	Using a sensitive sequencing assay, we compared the genomic profiles of ESCC and EAC with attention to identification of therapeutically relevant genomic alterations.
Case-control study	Methods: Next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a median coverage depth of >650× for all coding exons of 315 cancer-related genes plus selected introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.
Case-control study	Results from a single sample were evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GAs) including point mutations, short insertions and deletions, gene amplifications, homozygous deletions, and fusions/rearrangements.
Case-control study	Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs) were defined as alterations linked to approved drugs and those under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials.
Case-control study	Results: There were no significant differences by sex for either tumor type, and the median age for all patients was 63 years. All ESCCs and EACs were at an advanced stage at the time of sequencing.
Case-control study	All 71 ESCCs and 231 EACs featured GAs on profiling, with 522 GAs in ESCC (7. 4 per sample) and 1,303 GAs in EAC (5. 6 per sample). The frequency of clinically relevant GAs in ESCC was 94% (2. 6 per sample) and 93% in EAC (2. 7 per sample).
Case-control study	CRGAs occurring more frequently in EAC included KRAS (23% EAC vs. 6% ESCC) and ERBB2 (23% EAC vs. 3% ESCC). ESCC samples were enriched for CRGA in PIK3CA (24% ESCC vs. 10% EAC), PTEN (11% ESCC vs. 4% EAC), and NOTCH1 (17% ESCC vs. 3% EAC).
Case-control study	Other GAs that differed significantly between histologic tumor types included SMAD4 (14% EAC vs. 1% ESCC), RB1 (14% ESCC vs. 2% EAC), SOX2 (18% ESCC vs. 1% EAC), and NFE2L2 (24% ESCC vs. 1% EAC).
Case-control study	Conclusion: ESCC and EAC share similarly high frequencies of overall and clinically relevant genomic alterations; however, the profiles of genomic alterations in the two diseases differ widely, with KRAS and ERBB2 far more frequently altered in EAC compared with ESCC and with mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway genes (PIK3CA and PTEN) and NOTCH1 more frequently altered in ESCC compared with EAC.
Case-control study	Comprehensive genomic profiling highlights the promise of identifying clinically relevant genomic alterations in both ESCC and EAC and suggests new avenues for molecularly directed therapies in esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Esophageal Adenocarcinomas Reveals Similarities and Differences
Cross-sectional study	Background: Incidence rates for esophageal adenocarcinoma previously were reported to be increasing rapidly, especially among white males. Rates for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma also were observed to be rising, although less rapidly.
Cross-sectional study	In this article, the authors update the incidence trends through 1994 and further consider the trends by age group.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data were used to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates for esophageal carcinoma by histologic type and gastric adenocarcinoma by anatomic subsite.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Among white males, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus rose > 350% since the mid-1970s, surpassing squamous cell carcinoma around 1990. Rates also rose among black males, but remained at much lower levels.
Cross-sectional study	To a lesser extent, there were continuing increases in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma among white and black males, which nearly equaled the rates for noncardia tumors of the stomach in white men.
Cross-sectional study	The upward trend for both tumors was much greater among older than younger men. Although the incidence also rose among females, rates remained much lower than among males.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Previously reported increases of esophageal adenocarcinoma are continuing, most notably among white males.
Cross-sectional study	Cigarette smoking may contribute to the trend through an early stage carcinogenic effect, along with obesity, which may increase intraabdominal pressure and predispose to gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Cross-sectional study	Further research into esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is needed to clarify the risk factors and mechanisms responsible for the upward trends as well as the racial and gender disparities in incidence.

Case series	From 1959 to 1981, mass screening of esophageal cancer disclosed that the age-adjusted incidence in the 40- to 69-year-old population in Lin County, Henan Province, was 470/10(5) In its northern part, an even higher incidence of 760/10(5)was found.
Case series	As they were discovered by mass screening, most of them were found to have early lesions. Surgical treatment was done in attempt to find out the feasibility of managing esophageal carcinoma by early diagnosis and early treatment.
Case series	This paper is the result of the long-term follow-up.
Case series	Methods: Since 1972, a total of 17 extensive mass screening has been conducted among more than 160,000 participants in the rural areas in Henan, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu provinces, sorting out more than 30,000 high-risk individuals.
Case series	Among these individuals, 24,600 were examined by endoscopy, discovering 2,094 patients with carcinomas in the esophagus or gastric cardia; 757 of these 2,094 patients were found to have superficial esophageal cancer; 420 patients accepted surgical treatment.
Case series	Esophagectomy with gastric replacement was performed through left thoracotomy in all patients. Cervical anastomosis 94 (22. 4%), intrathoracic supraaortic anastomosis 307 (73. 1%), and infra-aortic anastomosis 19 (4. 5%) were done.
Case series	Double thoracoabdominal lymphatic dissection was performed. Results: The resection rate was 100%. One-month operative mortality occurred in 5 (1. 2%). Postoperative complications developed and were satisfactorily treated in 28 patients (6. 7%).
Case series	Pathology of the cancer specimens showed that there were carcinoma in situ in 76 (all without lymphatic metastasis), intramucosal (TI) carcinoma in 126 (2 [1. 6%] with lymphatic metastasis), and submucous infiltrating (TI) carcinoma in 218 (34 [15.
Case series	6%] with lymphatic metastasis). All these 420 patients have been followed up to 2001 with a follow-up rate of 94. 1%. Those who were lost to follow-up were taken as censored cases. The survival rates were calculated by the life-table method.
Case series	The 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year survival rates were 86. 14%, 75. 03%, 64. 48%, 56. 17%, and 49. 93%, respectively. Conclusions: Esophageal balloon cytology, endoscopy, mucosa 1.
Case series	2% iodine stain, and multipoint biopsy may be the best approach for early diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma. Surgical resection of superficial esophageal cancer provides excellent long-term survival with acceptable quality of life.
Case series	It was discovered that carcinoma in situ and intramucosal carcinoma gave far better results than the submucosal infiltrative carcinoma, as the latter tends to have a higher frequency of lymphatic metastasis.
Case series	Long-term results of operation for 420 patients with early squamous cell esophageal carcinoma discovered by screening
Case series	Background: Recently, the diagnosis of superficial oesophageal carcinoma has increased markedly in Japan as a result of advances in endoscopy. A number of these carcinomas have proved to be multiple.
Case series	Methods: Some 359 patients with superficial squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus who underwent oesophagectomy (n = 276) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (n = 83) were reviewed retrospectively.
Case series	The clinicopathological features of patients with multiple superficial oesophageal carcinoma were compared with those of patients with a single superficial oesophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Results: Of the 359 patients, 99 (28 per cent) had multiple superficial oesophageal carcinoma. The male : female ratio in patients with multiple carcinoma was 98 : 1, compared with 5. 3 : 1 for those with a single carcinoma (n = 260) (P = 0. 0001).
Case series	The incidence of tobacco and alcohol use was significantly higher in the patients with multiple carcinoma than in those with a single carcinoma (P = 0. 04 and P = 0. 03 respectively).
Case series	The incidence of pharyngeal malignancy was also significantly higher in patients with multiple carcinoma (P = 0. 02).
Case series	Conclusion: The high incidence of multiple superficial oesophageal carcinoma indicates a need for careful evaluation of the oesophagus at the time of initial diagnosis, treatment and follow-up for superficial oesophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Male sex, smoking, alcohol use and the presence of pharnygeal malignancy are high-risk factors for multiple superficial oesophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Clinicopathological study of multiple superficial oesophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: The depth of tumor penetration is a crucial factor in determining the prognosis of patients with esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma (SEC) have a far more favorable clinical course compared with those with advanced cancers. The outcome for patients with mucosal cancer is excellent with a 5-year survival rate exceeding 80%.
Case series	On the other hand, submucosal cancer often metastasizes to regional and/or distant lymph nodes or other organs, and the prognosis of these patients are far from satisfactory.
Case series	Methods: Among 334 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between December 1980 and December 2006, 100 patients (30%) had SEC confined to the epithelium, lamina propria mucosa, or submucosa.
Case series	Patient and tumor characteristics of those 100 patients were studied. Results: The prevalence of SEC has increased from 13% (8 of 61) in the initial 5-year period (1985-1989) to 44% (41 of 93) in the recent 7-year period (2000-2006).
Case series	Subjective symptoms were present in 7 (14%) of 51 mucosal cancers and in 13 (27%) of 49 submucosal cancers. The remaining 80 patients (80%) had no subjective symptoms.
Case series	Ninety-one patients (91%) were diagnosed to have the lesions by endoscopy at the time of screening for gastric problems, and only nine were detected by gastrointestinal series.
Case series	Four of 51 patients with mucosal cancer had venous or lymph vessel invasion, and among those, only one (2%) had a solitary perigastric lymph node metastasis.
Case series	In 49 patients with submucosal cancer, 35 (71%) had lymph vessel invasion, 28 (57%) had venous invasion, and 16 (33%) had lymph node metastases.
Case series	In particular, 15 of 35 patients with positive lymph vessel invasion had lymph node metastasis, whereas only 1 of 14 with negative lymph vessel invasion had lymph node metastasis (P <. 05).
Case series	Among 17 patients with nodal involvement, 4 patients with upper thoracic SEC had upper mediastinum and/or cervical nodal metastases, 11 patients with middle thoracic SEC had widespread upper and lower mediastinal and abdominal metastases, and 2 patients with lower thoracic SEC had lower and abdominal lymph node metastases.
Case series	Seventy-nine patients were alive without recurrence at last follow-up. Five of 49 patients with submucosal cancer died of recurrent disease, and 4 of these developed regional nodal recurrence around the bilateral laryngeal recurrent nerves.
Case series	Forty-two patients (42%) developed double cancers during the follow-up period, and 5 died of a second cancer.
Case series	The 3- and 5-year survival rates of all 100 patients were 85% and 73%, and those disease-specific survival rates were 96% and 93%, respectively.
Case series	The 3- and 5-year survival rates for patients with mucosal cancer were 89% and 83%, and those for submucosal cancer were 80%, and 64%, respectively.
Case series	Conclusions: Esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy should be carried out particularly for upper thoracic submucosal cancer, whereas esophagectomy with moderate lymphadenectomy may be preferred for mucosal cancer.
Case series	Patients with SEC should be examined for another primary cancer preoperatively and periodically during follow-up.
Case series	Clinicopathologic features of superficial esophageal cancer: results of consecutive 100 patients
Case series	Objective: The incidence and mortality related to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has been rising in the United States. Meanwhile, the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures has increased in number and improved technologically.
Case series	However, the impact of these advances on the survival of EAC in clinical practice remains unknown.
Case series	Methods: Patients with histologically proven EAC between 1973 and 1997 were identified in registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, and analyzed in 5-yr time periods.
Case series	The observed and relative survival rates were calculated. The joint influence of the time of diagnosis, stage and grade of cancer, demographic features, surgical therapy, and radiotherapy were assessed in Cox proportional hazard survival analyses.
Case series	Results: Between 1973 and 1997, we identified 4835 patients with EAC. The 1-yr and 5-yr observed survival rates increased from 34% and 5% during 1973-1977 to 44% and 13% during 1993-1997 (p < 0. 05).
Case series	In the Cox survival analysis, the more recent year of diagnosis, early stage of tumor, younger age at presentation, receiving radiotherapy or surgery were independent predictors of reduced risk of mortality.
Case series	The proportion of patients with in situ EAC and those with local spread increased progressively from 0. 3% and 17. 7% in 1973-1977 to 2. 3% and 25. 3%, respectively, in 1993-1997 (p < 0. 05).
Case series	The proportion of patients receiving radiation therapy either before or after surgery has increased from 7% in 1973-1977 to 16% in 1993-1997 (p < 0. 05).
Case series	Conclusions: The short- and long-term survival of patients with EAC has improved slightly in the United States over the past 25 yr.
Case series	Some of the improvement may be related to an increase in the number of younger patients, and in cases with in situ and localized cancers. However, the overall survival of patients with EAC remains dismal.
Case series	Temporal trends (1973-1997) in survival of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma in the United States: a glimmer of hope?
Cross-sectional study	Background: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in White males has been reported to be increasing.
Cross-sectional study	The aims of this study were to determine: 1) the incidence trends of esophageal carcinoma in the United States with an emphasis on histologic type, sex, and ethnicity, 2) whether the reported increase in stage IV tumors can be confirmed, and 3) survival trends and factors affecting survival.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Data from the SEER program of the National Cancer Institute with submission dates 1973-98 were used. Data on Hispanics were available for analysis only for the years 1992-98.
Cross-sectional study	Statistical analysis was performed utilizing SEER*Stat and SAS statistical software packages. Results: The incidence of adenocarcinoma in White males is still rising (7. 8%/year, P < 0. 0001); however, the same trend was observed for White females (6.
Cross-sectional study	48%/year; P < 0. 0001). Hispanic males (3. 91 %/year; P < 0. 02), and Hispanic females (9. 4%/ year; P < 0. 04).
Cross-sectional study	The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma has been steadily declining in White males and females and in Black females since 1973, with the incidence showing a dramatic and significant decline in Black males beginning in 1992 (8. 53%/year; P = 0. 0009).
Cross-sectional study	Stage 4 carcinoma is declining in incidence. Survival of patients with esophageal carcinomas has been improving.
Cross-sectional study	In a Cox multivariate model, independent prognostic factors in esophageal carcinoma included tumor stage, tumor type, gender, race, age at diagnosis, and year of diagnosis.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: 1) The incidence of adenocarcinoma continues to rise in White males and females, but also in Hispanics, while squamous cell carcinoma is declining; 2) the incidence of stage 4 carcinomas has been declining, and 3) survival has been steadily improving, independently of all other risk factors.
Cross-sectional study	Incidence and survival trends of esophageal carcinoma in the United States: racial and gender differences by histological type
review	Use of tobacco, moderate to heavy alcohol ingestion, infrequent consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, and low income accounted for more [figure: see text] than 98% of the SCE rates among both African American and white men and for 99% of the excess incidence among African Americans compared to whites in a case-control study in three areas of the United States [14].
review	Thus, it is likely that declines in the prevalence of smoking and drinking, especially among men, and increased intake of fresh fruits and vegetables may have contributed to the downward incidence and mortality rate trends reported for SCE.
review	In addition, it seems plausible that obesity, GERD, and possibly reductions in H. pylori prevalence have contributed to the upward trends in ACE rates. Reductions in smoking, improved diet, and reductions in H.
review	pylori prevalence probably have contributed to the consistent reductions observed for NGA. Contributing factors are less clear for the rising incidence rates of GCA during the 1970s and 1980s.
review	These incidence rates have not continued to rise in recent years.
review	Epidemiologic trends in esophageal and gastric cancer in the United States
Case series	Background: Endoscopic resection is increasingly used to treat localized, early-stage esophageal cancer.
Case series	We sought to assess its adoption, characterize the risks of nodal metastases, and define differences in procedural mortality and 5-year survival between endoscopic and surgical resection in the United States.
Case series	Methods: From the National Cancer Data Base, patients with T1a and T1b lesions were identified. Treatment patterns were characterized, and hierarchical regression methods were used to define predictors and evaluate outcomes.
Case series	All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Five thousand three hundred ninety patients were identified and underwent endoscopic (26. 5%) or surgical resection (73. 5%). Endoscopic resection increased from 19. 0% to 53. 0% for T1a lesions (P <.
Case series	001) and from 6. 6% to 20. 9% for T1b cancers (P <. 001). The strongest predictors of endoscopic resection were depth of invasion (T1a vs T1b: odds ratio [OR] = 4. 45; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3. 76 to 5.
Case series	27) and patient age of 75 years or older (vs age less than 55 years: OR = 4. 86; 95% CI = 3. 60 to 6. 57). Among patients undergoing surgery, lymph node metastasis was 5. 0% for T1a and 16. 6% for T1b lesions.
Case series	Predictors of nodal metastases included tumor size greater than 2 cm (vs. <2 cm) and intermediate-/high-grade lesions (vs low grade). For example, 0. 5% of patients with low-grade T1a lesions less than 2 cm had lymph node involvement.
Case series	The risk of 30-day mortality was less after endoscopic resection (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 33; 95% CI = 0. 19 to 0. 58) but greater for conditional 5-year survival (HR = 1. 63; 95% CI = 1. 07 to 2. 47).
Case series	Conclusions: Endoscopic resection has become the most common treatment of T1a esophageal cancer and has increased for T1b cancers.
Case series	It remains important to balance the risk of nodal metastases and procedural risk when counseling patients regarding their treatment options.
Case series	Treatment trends, risk of lymph node metastasis, and outcomes for localized esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: In considering treatment allocation for patients with early esophageal adenocarcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis is a critical determinant; however, this has not been well defined or stratified by the relevant clinical predictors of lymph node spread.
Case series	Methods: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute were abstracted from 2004 to 2010 for patients with early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	The incidence of lymph node involvement for patients with Tis, T1a, and T1b tumors was examined and was stratified by predictors of spread. Results: A total of 13,996 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma were evaluated.
Case series	Excluding those with advanced, metastatic, and/or invasive (T2-T4) disease, 715 patients with Tis, T1a, and T1b tumors were included. On multivariate analysis, tumor grade (odds ratio [OR], 2. 76; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1. 58-4. 82 [P<.
Case series	001]), T classification (OR, 0. 47; 95% CI, 0. 24-0. 91 [P =. 025]), and tumor size (OR, 2. 68; 95% CI, 1. 48-4. 85 [P =. 001]) were found to be independently associated with lymph node metastases. There was no lymph node spread noted with Tis tumors.
Case series	For patients with low-grade (well or moderately differentiated) tumors measuring <2 cm in size, the risk of lymph node metastasis was 1. 7% for T1a (P<. 001) and 8. 6% for T1b (P =. 001) tumors.
Case series	Conclusions: For patients with low-grade Tis or T1 tumors measuring ≤2 cm in size, the incidence of lymph node metastasis appears to be comparable to the mortality rate associated with esophagectomy.
Case series	For highly selected patients with early esophageal adenocarcinomas, the results of the current study support the recommendation that local endoscopic resection can be considered as an alternative to surgical management when followed by rigorous endoscopic and radiographic surveillance.

Case series	Treatment allocation in patients with early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma: Prevalence and predictors of lymph node involvement
Case series	Background: Knowledge of factors related to outcome is vital for the selection of therapeutic alternatives for patients with early (T1) esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	This study was undertaken to determine predictors of lymphatic spread and prognostic factors for T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma following esophagectomy.
Case series	Materials and methods: A prospectively maintained database identified 85 patients with T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent esophagectomy without neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Depth of tumor invasion (T stage) was subdivided into mucosal (T1a) or submucosal invasion (T1b). Median follow-up was 59 months. Results: Thoracoscopically assisted 3-phase esophagectomy was performed in 73 of 85 patients (86%).
Case series	Lymph node metastases (N stage) were identified in 9 of 85 patients (11%). Depth of tumor invasion (T stage), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and poor differentiation were associated with N stage.
Case series	The patients could be stratified into 4 risk groups for lymph node metastases: group I--T1a (0 of 35 patients [0%] with positive nodes); group II--T1b, well/moderate differentiation and no LVI (1 of 28 patients [4%] with positive nodes); group III--T1b, poor differentiation and no LVI (2 of 9 patients [22%] with positive nodes); and group IV--T1b any grade with LVI (6 of 13 patients [46%] with positive nodes).
Case series	Survival analyses found T stage, N stage, LVI, and poor differentiation to be significant prognostic factors. Conclusions: Risk stratification is possible for patents with T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Local resection techniques without lymphadenectomy may be alternatives for T1a tumors. Esophagectomy should remain the standard of care for patients with T1b tumors and those with LVI or poor differentiation considered for neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	Risk stratification for early esophageal adenocarcinoma: analysis of lymphatic spread and prognostic factors
Case series	We examined lymph node metastasis clinicopathologically in 236 cases of superficial cancer (T1, Tis) of the thoracic esophagus surgically resected at our department without adjuvant treatment.
Case series	Mucosal cancer was observed in 112 cases (47%) and submucosal cancer in 124 cases (53%). Lymph node metastasis was present in 3% of mucosal cancer cases and 41% of submucosal cancer cases.
Case series	By the recent pathologic subclassification of the extent of the cancerous invasion in superficial esophageal cancer, mucosal cancer and submucosal cancer were each divided into three subtypes according to the extent of invasion, i. e.
Case series	m1, m2, m3, sm1, sm2 and sm3 cancers. There was no case of lymph node metastasis in m1 and m2 cases, but it was observed in 8% of m3 cases, in 11% of sm1 cases, in 30% of sm2 cases and in 61% of sm3 cases.
Case series	The number of involved nodes was three or less in m3 and sm1 cases, however four or more involved nodes were observed in 14% of sm2 cases and in 24% of sm3 cases. Positive lymph nodes were found only in the mediastinum in m3 and sm1 cases.
Case series	On the contrary, they were found extensively in the mediastinum, the abdomen and the neck and in two or more regions in 27% of sm2 cases and in 38% of sm3 cases.
Case series	Considering the location of positive nodes, the recurrent nerve lymph nodes were most frequently involved, followed by the cardiac lymph nodes. A similar tendency was observed in cases with single node metastasis.
Case series	The 5-year survival rate of cases from m1 to sm1 was similar. That of sm3 cases was significantly worse than that of other groups.
Case series	Based on the clinical results, the therapeutic guidelines for superficial cancer of the thoracic esophagus are considered to be as follows: (i) in m1 and m2 cancer, endoscopic mucosal resection is generally indicated in principle, although transhiatal esophagectomy may be indicated in some cases; (ii) in m3 and sm1 cancer, endoscopic mucosal resection is performed initially, then subsequent treatment is selected if necessary; (iii) in sm2 and sm3 cancer, conventional transthoracic esophagectomy with systematic lymph node dissection is indicated.
Case series	Clinicopathologic analysis of lymph node metastasis in surgically resected superficial cancer of the thoracic esophagus
Case series	Background: The ability to predict lymph node metastasis in cases of superficial esophageal carcinoma before surgery would allow the identification of specific patients who do not require additional surgical resection after endoscopic local resection.
Case series	Methods: From 1980 to 2002 a total of 160 patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma, Tis or T1 tumors, underwent subtotal esophagectomy with lymph node dissection.
Case series	On the basis of clinicopathologic data the risk factors for lymph node metastases are discussed.
Case series	Results: Patients with tumors that showed submucosal invasion, a nonflat shape, and lymphatic invasion had a higher risk for lymph node metastasis than the other patients.
Case series	Multivariate analysis showed that the tumor depth and the macroscopic shape of the tumor were independent risk factors for lymph node metastases. Conclusions: Esophagectomy with lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with submucosal cancer.
Case series	Local tumor resection can be recommended for patients with mucosal cancer without lymphatic invasion.
Case series	Prediction of lymph node status in patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma: analysis of 160 surgically resected cancers
Case-control study	This study was designed to determine the optimum treatment for a superficial esophageal cancer involving the mucosal or submucosal layer of the esophagus.
Case-control study	The subjects were 150 patients with a superficial esophageal cancer who underwent endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or esophagectomy in Kurume University Hospital from 1981 to 1997.
Case-control study	The mortality and morbidity rates, survival rate, and recurrence rate were retrospectively compared for (1) 35 patients who underwent EMR and 37 patients who underwent esophagectomy for a mucosal esophageal cancer and (2) 45 patients who underwent extended radical esophagectomy and 33 patients who underwent less radical esophagectomy for a submucosal esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	Among the 72 patients with a mucosal cancer, lymph node metastasis/recurrence was observed in only one (1%); whereas of 78 patients with a submucosal cancer it was observed in 30 (38%).
Case-control study	Among patients with a mucosal cancer the mortality and morbidity rates after EMR were lower than for those after esophagectomy. The survival rate after EMR was the same as that after esophagectomy.
Case-control study	No recurrence was observed after either treatment modality.
Case-control study	Among the patients with a submucosal cancer, the survival rate was higher and the recurrence rate lower after extended radical esophagectomy; than after less radical esophagectomy; the mortality and morbidity rates after extended radical esophagectomy were the same as those after less radical esophagectomy.
Case-control study	Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the treatment modality (EMR versus esophagectomy) did not influence the survival of patients with a mucosal esophageal cancer, whereas it strongly influenced the survival of patients with a submucosal esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	We concluded that EMR was the mainstay of treatment for a mucosal esophageal cancer, and extended radical esophagectomy was the mainstay of treatment for a submucosal esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	Optimum treatment strategy for superficial esophageal cancer: endoscopic mucosal resection versus radical esophagectomy
Case series	Superficially invasive esophageal adenocarcinomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors, including tumors invading into mucosa and submucosa.
Case series	The prognostic significance of the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node status in this group of patients remain unclear. We evaluated 90 consecutive patients with resected T1 adenocarcinoma of esophagus or esophagogastric junction.
Case series	The T1 tumors were classified into four groups based on the depth of invasion: T1a, invading into lamina propria; T1b, into muscularis mucosae; T1c, into superficial submucosa; and T1d, into deep submucosa.
Case series	The depth of tumor invasion was compared with clinicopathologic features. The depth of tumor invasion was significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis (36% in T1d, 8% in T1c, 12% in T1b, and 0% in T1a; P < 0.
Case series	001) and with tumor size (76% > 1. 2 cm in T1d, 75% in T1c, 35% in T1b, and 25% in T1a; P < 0. 001).
Case series	The 5-year recurrence-free and overall survivals were significantly better in patients with tumors confined to mucosa (100% and 91%, respectively) than invasive into submucosa (60% and 58%; P = 0. 0005 and P = 0. 02, respectively).
Case series	Lymph node metastasis was associated with tumor recurrence (P = 0. 01) but not overall survival. Lymphovascular invasion was associated with both tumor recurrence (P = 0. 001) and overall survival (P < 0.
Case series	001) and was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = 0. 04).
Case series	Our study indicated evaluation of depth of tumor invasion, status of lymph nodes, and lymphovascular invasion is important in resected superficially invasive esophageal adenocarcinoma and may provide supportive information for the decision about postoperative adjuvant therapy.
Case series	Significance of the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis in superficially invasive (T1) esophageal adenocarcinoma
Case series	Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, or GEJ, has a poor prognosis. Early lesions [i. e. high grade dysplasia (HGD) or T1-carcinoma] are potentially curable.
Case series	Local endoscopic therapies are promising treatment options for superficial lesions; however, for deeper lesions, surgical resection is considered to be the treatment of choice.
Case series	To contribute to therapeutic decision-making, we retrospectively analysed the outcome of transhiatal esophagectomy in 120 patients with pathologically proven HGD (n=13) or T1-adenocarcinoma (n=107) of the distal esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ).
Case series	Tumors were subdivided into six different depths of invasion ('T1-mucosal' m1-m3, 'T1-submucosal' sm1-sm3), and the frequency of lymphatic dissemination and time to locoregional and/or distant recurrence were analysed.
Case series	Only one of the 79 T1m1-3/sm1 tumors (1%) showed lymph node metastases as compared with 18 out of 41 T1sm2-3 tumors (44%). There was a significant difference in recurrence-free period between T1m1-m3/sm1 versus T1sm2-sm3 tumor patients (P log rank <0.
Case series	0001), with 5-year recurrence-free percentages of 97% and 57%, respectively.
Case series	In multivariate analysis including age, gender, tumor differentiation grade, N-stage and depth of invasion, only N-stage was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free period (hazard rate=5. 9, 95% CI 1. 7-20. 7).
Case series	However, if N-stage was excluded from analysis, only depth of invasion (T1sm2-3 versus T1m1-m3/sm1) was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free period (hazard rate=7. 5, 95% CI 2. 0-27. 7).
Case series	These data indicate that T1m1-m3/sm1 adenocarcinomas of esophagus or GEJ show a very low risk of lymphatic dissemination and are therefore eligible for local endoscopic therapy.
Case series	After transhiatal surgical resection, almost half of the patients with T1sm2-sm3 lesions develop recurrent disease within 5 years, and therefore need additional therapy to improve survival.
Case series	Outcome of surgical treatment for early adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction
Case series	Background: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a less invasive localized treatment for patients with esophageal carcinoma. However, indications for EMR use in cases of superficial esophageal carcinoma are controversial.
Case series	The authors evaluated histopathologic risk factors for lymph node metastasis and recurrence. Methods: In the specimens resected, the authors examined depth, the superficial area and the area attached to or infiltrating the lamina muscularis mucosa.
Case series	Results: The authors found that the superficial area and the attached or infiltrated area reflected the depth of the tumor. However, there was a recurrence of esophageal carcinoma even in m3 cases attached only to the lamina muscularis mucosa.
Case series	Conclusions: The authors concluded that ml and m2 esophageal carcinoma had almost no risk of lymph node metastasis and recurrence no matter how extensive the superficial area.
Case series	In addition, sm2 and sm3 carcinoma have a high frequency of lymph node metastasis and recurrence.
Case series	M3 and sm1 carcinoma run the risk of lymph node metastasis and recurrence however small the superficial area and the area attached to or infiltrating the lamina muscularis mucosa.
Case series	Treatment strategies for patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma, including EMR, should take the above findings into account.
Case series	Pathologic features of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with lymph node and distal metastasis
Case series	Background: Esophageal carcinoma is among the cancers with the worst prognosis. Real chances for cure depend on both early recognition and early treatment.
Case series	The ability to predict lymph node involvement allows early curative treatment with less invasive approaches.
Case series	Aims: To determine clinicohistopathological criteria correlated with lymph node involvement in patients with early esophageal cancer (T1) and to identify the best candidate patients for local endoscopic or less invasive surgical treatments.
Case series	Methods: A total of 98 patients with pT1 esophageal cancer [67 with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 31 with adenocarcinomas (ADK)] underwent Ivor-Lewis or McKeown esophagectomy in the period between 1980 and 2006 at our institution.
Case series	Based on the depth of invasion, lesions were classified as m1, m2, or m3 if mucosal, and sm1, sm2, or sm3 if submucosal.
Case series	Results: The rates of lymph node metastasis were 0% for the 27 mucosal carcinomas (T1m) and 28% for the 71 submucosal (T1sm) carcinomas (P < 0. 001). Sm1 carcinomas were associated with a lower rate of lymph-node metastasis (8.
Case series	3% versus 49 % sm2/3, P = 0. 003). As for histotype, the rates of lymph node metastasis for sm1 were 0% for ADK and 12. 5% for SCC; for sm2/3 there were no significant differences.
Case series	On multivariate analysis, depth of infiltration, lymphocytic infiltrate, angiolymphatic and neural invasion were significantly associated with lymph node involvement.
Case series	Neural invasion was the single parameter with the greatest accuracy (82%); depth of infiltration and angiolymphatic invasion had 75% accuracy. Altogether these three parameters had an accuracy of 97%. Five-year survival rate was 56. 7% overall: 77.
Case series	7% for T1m and 53. 3% for T1sm (P = 0. 048).
Case series	Conclusions: The most important factors for predicting lymph node metastasis in early esophageal cancer are depth of tumor infiltration, angiolymphatic invasion, neural invasion and grade of lymphocytic infiltration.
Case series	The best candidates for endoscopic therapy are tumors with high-grade lymphocytic infiltration, no angiolymphatic or neural invasion, mucosal infiltration or sm1 (only for ADK), and tumor <1 cm in size.
Case series	For sm SCC and sm2/3 ADK the treatment of choice remains esophagectomy with standard lymphadenectomy.
Case series	Prediction of lymph node status in superficial esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Endoscopic resection and ablation have advanced the treatment of intramucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma and have been promoted as definitive therapy for selected superficial submucosal tumors.
Case series	Controversy exists regarding the prevalence of nodal metastases at various depths of mucosal and submucosal invasion. Our aim was to clarify this prevalence and identify predictors of nodal spread.
Case series	Study design: An expert gastrointestinal pathologist retrospectively reviewed 54 T1 adenocarcinomas from 258 esophagectomy specimens (2000 to 2008).
Case series	Tumors were classified as intramucosal or submucosal, the latter being subclassified as SM1 (upper third), SM2 (middle third), or SM3 (lower third) based on the depth of tumor invasion.
Case series	The depth of invasion was correlated with the prevalence of positive nodes. Fisher's exact test and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify variables predicting nodal disease.
Case series	Results: Nodal metastases were present in 0% (0 of 25) of intramucosal, 21% (3 of 14) of SM1, 36% (4 of 11) of SM2, and 50% (2 of 4) of SM3 tumors. The differences were significant between intramucosal and submucosal tumors (p < 0.
Case series	0001), although not between the various subclassifications of submucosal tumors (p = 0. 503). Univariate logistic regression identified poor differentiation (p = 0. 024), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.
Case series	049), and number of harvested lymph nodes (p = 0. 037) as significantly correlated with nodal disease. Multivariate logistic regression did not identify any of the tested variables as independent predictors of the prevalence of positive lymph nodes.
Case series	Conclusions: All depths of submucosal invasion of esophageal adenocarcinoma were associated with an unacceptably high prevalence of nodal metastases and a marked increase relative to intramucosal cancer.
Case series	Accurate predictors of nodal spread, independent of tumor depth, are currently lacking and will be necessary before recommending endoscopic resection with or without concomitant ablation as curative treatment for even superficial submucosal neoplasia.
Case series	Are endoscopic therapies appropriate for superficial submucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma? An analysis of esophagectomy specimens
Case series	Objective: To identify differences in survival of patients with pT1 esophageal cancer relating to depth of wall infiltration.
Case series	Background data: Histologic analysis of mucosal and submucosal infiltration in thirds has shown an increasing rate of lymph node metastases (LNM) according to the depth of wall infiltration in pT1 esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: One hundred seventy-one patients had transthoracic en bloc (n = 161) or transhiatal esophagectomy (n = 10) for pT1 esophageal cancer [121 adenocarcinomas (AC), 50 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC)].
Case series	The histologic analysis of the specimen comprised depth of wall penetration of the carcinoma in thirds of pT1a = mucosa (m1, m2, m3) or pT1b = submucosa (sm1, sm2, sm3) and number and infiltration of the resected lymph nodes.
Case series	Results: The rate of LNM was 0% for 70 mucosal carcinomas and 34% for 101 submucosal carcinomas (P = 0. 001). For sm1, this rate was 13%, for sm2 19% and for sm3 56%. The 5-year survival rate (5Y-SR) was 82% for pN0 and 45% for pN+ patients (P < 0.
Case series	001). There was no significant prognostic difference between AC and SCC (5Y-SR: 74% vs 71%). The 5Y-SR of the pT1a group was 87% compared with 66% for pT1b (P = 0. 046).
Case series	The 5-year survival rate for sm1 and sm2 were similar; sm1 + sm2 were together significantly better (80%) than sm3 (46%) (P = 0. 008). In multivariate analysis, only sm3 was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0. 01).
Case series	Conclusions: After esophagectomy, the prognosis of patients with sm1/sm2 infiltration is as good as for patients with mucosal carcinoma. Sm3 infiltration is the worst prognostic factor in pT1 esophageal cancer.
Case series	Prognostic impact of upper, middle, and lower third mucosal or submucosal infiltration in early esophageal cancer
Case series	Objectives: Long-term outcomes after endoscopic resection (ER) provide important information for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the rates of survival and metastasis after ER of esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Methods: From 1995 to 2010, 570 patients with esophageal carcinoma were treated by ER.
Case series	Of these, the 402 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (280 epithelial (EP) or lamina propria (LPM) cancer, 70 muscularis mucosa (MM) cancer, and 52 submucosal (SM) cancer) were included in our analysis.
Case series	Seventeen patients had cancer invading into the submucosa up to 0. 2 mm (SM1) and 35 patients had cancer invading into the submucosa more than 0. 2 mm (SM2). Results: The mean (range) follow-up time was 50 (4-187) months.
Case series	The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with EP/LPM, MM, and SM cancer were 90. 5, 71. 1, and 70. 8%, respectively (P=0. 007).
Case series	Multivariate analysis identified depth of invasion and age as independent predictors of survival, with hazard ratios of 3. 6 for MM cancer and 3. 2 for SM cancer compared with EP/LPM cancer, and 1. 07 per year of age.
Case series	The cumulative 5-year metastasis rates in patients with EP/LPM, MM, SM1, and SM2 cancer were 0. 4, 8. 7, 7. 7, and 36. 2%, respectively (P<0. 001).
Case series	Multivariate analysis identified depth of invasion as an independent risk factor for metastasis, with hazard ratios of 13. 1 for MM, 40. 2 for SM1, and 196. 3 for SM2 cancer compared with EP/LPM cancer.
Case series	The cumulative 5-year metastasis rates in patients with mucosal cancer with and without lymphovascular involvement were 46. 7 and 0. 7%, respectively (P<0. 0001).
Case series	Conclusions: The long-term risk of metastasis after ER was mainly associated with the depth of invasion. This risk should be taken into account when considering the indications for ER.
Case series	Long-term outcome and metastatic risk after endoscopic resection of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Background and aims: Submucosal invasion of superficial esophageal cancer (SEC) is related to the prognosis. We prospectively analyzed outcomes of SEC in patients staged by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).
Case series	Patients and methods: We staged 31 endoscopically diagnosed SEC cases using a 20/15-MHz thin probe.
Case series	The EUS tumor stage was classified as EUSM (limited within mucosa), EUS-SM (with submucosal invasion), or EUS-MP over (invading the muscularis propria or deeper).
Case series	Lymph node metastasis and 2-yr survival were analyzed according to the EUS tumor stage in 29 squamous cell carcinoma cases. Interobserver agreement of the EUS stage was tested between the examiner and a blind reviewer.
Case series	Results: Lymph node metastasis was significantly frequent in the EUS-SM group (8 of 18 cases [44. 4%]) compared with the EUS-M group (1 of 10 cases [10%]) (p = 0. 03). Patient survival at 2 yr after initial therapy was 72.
Case series	2% in the EUS-SM group and 90% in the EUS-M group. Death from cancer was noted only in the EUS-SM group (three cases). The accuracy rates of EUS tumor staging were 74. 1% by the examiner and 66.
Case series	7% by the blind reviewer, with moderate interobserver agreement (kappa = 0. 46).
Case series	Conclusions: Thin-probe EUS can classify SEC into two groups: the EUS-M group with excellent outcome and the EUS-SM group with a significant risk of lymph node metastasis.
Case series	Prognostic value and interobserver agreement of endoscopic ultrasonography for superficial squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: a prospective study
Case series	No previous reports on lymph-node metastasis (LNM) from superficial squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have proposed definite criteria for additional treatment after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR).
Case series	We investigated the association between histopathological factors and LNM in 464 consecutive patients with superficial squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who had undergone a radical esophagectomy with lymph-node dissection (14 'M1' lesions: intraepithelial tumors, 36 'M2' lesions: tumors invading the lamina propria, 50 'M3' lesions: tumors in contact with or invading the muscularis mucosa, 32 'SM1' lesions: tumors invading the most superficial 1/3 of the submucosa and 332 'SM2/3' lesions: tumors invading deeper than SM1 level).
Case series	Histopathological factors including invasion depth, size, lymphatic invasion (LY), venous invasion, tumor differentiation, growth pattern, degree of nuclear atypia and histological grade were assessed for their association with LNM in 82 M3 or SM1 lesions to determine which patients need additional treatment after EMR.
Case series	LNM was found in 0. 0, 5. 6, 18. 0, 53. 1 and 53. 9% of the M1, M2, M3, SM1 and SM2/3 lesions, respectively.
Case series	A univariate analysis showed that each of the following histopathological factors had a significant influence on LNM: invasion depth (M3 vs SM1), LY, venous invasion and histological grade.
Case series	Invasion depth and LY were significantly associated with LNM in a multivariate analysis. Four out of 38 patients (10. 3%) with M3 lesions without LY had LNM, whereas five out of 12 patients (41. 7%) with M3 lesions and LY had LNM.
Case series	Only patients with M1/2 lesions are good candidates for EMR. Invading the muscularis mucosa (M3) is a high-risk condition for LNM the same as submucosal invasion, but M3 lesions without LY can be followed up after EMR without any additional treatment.
Case series	Histopathological criteria for additional treatment after endoscopic mucosal resection for esophageal cancer: analysis of 464 surgically resected cases
Case-control study	Background: Endoscopic mucosal resection is recommended for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus confined to the lamina propria.
Case-control study	However, endoscopic mucosal resection is often performed in patients with tumors that invade the muscularis mucosa or upper submucosa to minimize surgical invasiveness, despite the increased risk of lymph node metastasis.
Case-control study	This study prospectively evaluated long-term outcome in such patients.
Case-control study	Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with squamous cell esophageal carcinoma invading the muscularis mucosa or submucosa who underwent endoscopic mucosal resection from June 1992 through March 2000 (extended endoscopic mucosal resection group) were studied.
Case-control study	As control group, 44 consecutive patients with esophageal carcinoma invading the muscularis mucosae or upper third of the submucosa and no preoperative evidence of lymph node metastasis who underwent esophagectomy during the same period (surgical resection group) were studied.
Case-control study	Results: Overall survival rates at 5 years in the extended endoscopic mucosal resection group and surgical resection group were, respectively, 77. 4% and 84. 5%. There was no significant difference between survival distributions.
Case-control study	Cause-specific survival rates at 5 years in extended endoscopic mucosal resection and surgical resection groups were, respectively, 95. 0% and 93. 5%. Survival curves for the groups were similar.
Case-control study	Conclusion: Although patients were not randomized to extended endoscopic mucosal resection or surgical resection in this study, the results suggest that endoscopic mucosal resection may be safe and effective for management of squamous cell esophageal carcinoma invading the muscularis mucosae or upper submucosa.
Case-control study	Long-term outcome after endoscopic mucosal resection in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma invading the muscularis mucosae or deeper
Case-control study	Background: Esophageal cancer is an aggressive cancer with a reported 3-year survival of 20%. However, early-stage esophageal cancer can be cured by endoscopic resection (ER).
Case-control study	The long-term survival of esophageal mucosal squamous cell carcinoma after ER was investigated by calculating the standard mortality rate (SMR).
Case-control study	Methods: From January 1995 to December 2004, 110 patients with 138 esophageal mucosal squamous cell carcinomas without lymphovascular involvement were treated by ER.
Case-control study	Long-term survival after ER was compared with that in the general population by calculating SMR. Subgroup analysis of patients without second primary cancer diagnosed within 1 year before ER (subgroup A) was also performed.
Case-control study	Results: A total of 108 patients (98. 2%) were followed-up completely, with a mean observation period of 4. 7 (0. 4-11. 3) years. The cumulative 5-year survival rate of all patients and subgroup A was 79. 5% and 86. 6%, respectively.
Case-control study	Overall mortality (SMR, 1. 68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 05-2. 55) and mortality from malignant tumor (SMR, 3. 14; 95% CI, 1. 79-5. 09) was significantly higher than that in the general population.
Case-control study	SMR of esophageal cancer was high, although it was not significantly different from that in the general population (SMR, 4. 82; 95% CI, 0. 06-26. 81). In subgroup A overall mortality (SMR, 0. 86; 95% CI, 0. 41-1.
Case-control study	57) was similar to that in the general population. Conclusions: High overall mortality in patients with esophageal mucosal cancer after ER was mainly due to elevated mortality from second primary cancer.
Case-control study	Favorable mortality in subgroup A indicates the efficiency of ER as a curative treatment for esophageal mucosal cancer.
Case-control study	Long-term outcome of esophageal mucosal squamous cell carcinoma without lymphovascular involvement after endoscopic resection
Case series	Objectives: T1 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a low, but still present, risk of lymph node (LN) metastasis. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is often applied for T1 ESCC.
Case series	To achieve successful treatment by EMR/ESD, the risk of LN metastases, LN recurrence, and hematological recurrence need to be better understood. The aim of this study was to determine the precise risk for metastasis in T1 ESCC.
Case series	Methods: We divided 295 patients with T1 ESCC who underwent surgery and/or ESD/EMR into 6 categories (m1, m2, m3, sm1, sm2, and sm3). Their risks of LN metastasis, LN recurrence, hematological recurrence, and the outcome were determined.
Case series	Results: The rates of LN metastasis and LN recurrence were 0% in m1 and m2, 9% in m3, 16% in sm1, 35% in sm2, and 62% in sm3 cases. The incidence of hematological recurrence was 0% in m1, m2, m3, and sm1 cases; 9% in sm2 cases; and 13% in sm3 cases.
Case series	The overall risk of metastasis was 9% in m3, 16% in sm1, 38% in sm2, and 64% in sm3 patients. The 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 100% in m1, m2, and m3; 90. 9% in sm1; 78. 8% in sm2; and 68. 6% in sm3 patients.
Case series	Statistically, both lymphatic and venous invasion were selected as predictive markers for metastasis. In m3 patients, positivity for either of these had an odds ratio for metastasis of 7. 333 (P = 0. 093).
Case series	Conclusions: Our study provides a precise assessment of the comprehensive risk of metastasis and feasible predictive markers for T1 ESCC.
Case series	The overall prevalence of metastasis in T1 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective analysis of 295 patients
Case series	Background: Despite the increased risk for nodal disease, definitive endoscopic resection is being increasingly offered for lesions invasive into the submucosa based on the success with intramucosal tumors.
Case series	The aim of this study was to evaluate survival after esophagectomy alone for confirmed submucosal tumors after endoscopic resection.
Case series	Methods: Patients from seven centers in the USA who underwent esophagectomy for submucosal tumors removed with endoscopic resection were analyzed. Nodal involvement was correlated with recurrence and survival.
Case series	Results: We identified 23 patients with submucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophagectomy was performed at a median of 2 months (Interquartile range 1-3) after the endoscopic resection. There was no postoperative mortality.
Case series	Positive nodal disease was seen in 26 % of patients on final pathology. At a median of 37 months (Interquartile range 25-55), 91 % of patients were alive and free of disease. The disease-specific 5-year survival was 88 %.
Case series	Disease-specific 5-year survival was 67 % in patients with positive nodal metastases and 100 % in those without (p = 0. 159).
Case series	Conclusions: Esophagectomy is curative in the majority of patients with submucosal tumors even in the presence of nodal metastases.
Case series	These data serve as a benchmark for comparison when considering extending the indications for therapeutic endoscopic resection for submucosal tumors in the future.
Case series	Esophagectomy Following Endoscopic Resection of Submucosal Esophageal Cancer: a Highly Curative Procedure Even with Nodal Metastases
Case series	Background & aims: Patients with early-stage mucosal (T1a) esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are increasingly treated by endoscopic resection. EACs limited to the upper third of the submucosa (pT1b sm1) could also be treated by endoscopy.
Case series	We assessed the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of endoscopic therapy for these patients.
Case series	Methods: We analyzed data from 66 patients with sm1 low-risk lesions (macroscopically polypoid or flat, with a histologic pattern of sm1 invasion, good-to-moderate differentiation [G1/2], and no invasion into lymph vessels or veins) treated by endoscopic therapy at the HSK Hospital Wiesbaden from 1996 through 2010.
Case series	The efficacy of endoscopic therapy was assessed on the basis of rates of complete endoluminal remission (CER), metachronous neoplasia, lymph node events, and long-term remission (LTR). Safety was assessed on the basis of rate of complications.
Case series	Results: Remissions were assessed in 61 of the 66 patients; 53 of the 61 achieved CER (87%). Of patients with small focal neoplasias ≤2 cm, 97% achieved CER (for those with tumors ≥2 cm, 77%; P =. 026).
Case series	Metachronous neoplasias were observed in 10 of 53 patients (19%; 9 of the 10 underwent repeat endoscopic resection). One patient developed a lymph node metastasis (1. 9%).
Case series	Fifty-one patients achieved LTR (84%); 90% of those with focal lesions ≤2 cm achieved LTR after a mean follow-up period of 47 ± 29. 1 months (range, 8-120 months).
Case series	No tumor-associated deaths were observed, and the estimated 5-year survival rate was 84%. The rate of major complications from endoscopic resection was 1. 5%, and no patients died.
Case series	Conclusions: Endoscopic therapy appears to be a good alternative to esophagectomy for patients with pT1b sm1 EAC, on the basis of macroscopic and histologic analyses.
Case series	The risk of developing lymph node metastases after endoscopic resection for sm1 EAC is lower than the risk of surgery.

review	The Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society has developed endoscopic submucosal dissection/endoscopic mucosal resection guidelines.
review	These guidelines present recommendations in response to 18 clinical questions concerning the preoperative diagnosis, indications, resection methods, curability assessment, and surveillance of patients undergoing endoscopic resection for esophageal cancers based on a systematic review of the scientific literature.
review	Endoscopic submucosal dissection/endoscopic mucosal resection guidelines for esophageal cancer
Case series	Background: There has been considerable controversy with regard to surgical strategies for the treatment of superficial esophageal carcinoma, which is characterized by tumor confined within the epithelium (EP), muscularis mucosae (MM), or submucosa (SM).
Case series	The relationships among macroscopic shape, depth of invasion, and lymph node involvement in superficial tumors were investigated to devise therapeutic strategies for patients with such disease.
Case series	Methods: Thirty-three patients with superficial primary esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with regional lymph node dissection (3 EP, 6 MM, and 24 SM).
Case series	Tumors were divided into two types according to macroscopic characteristics: (1) tumors with elevated components and (2) flat or depressed tumors without an elevated component.
Case series	Results: Tumors with an elevated component (n = 19) showed invasion of the deep layer, and a high incidence of lymph node metastasis.
Case series	Conversely, tumors without an elevated component (n = 14) showed varied depths of invasion, and, with one exception, had no lymph node involvement.
Case series	Conclusions: The existence of an elevated component in superficial esophageal cancer is an important macroscopic feature suggesting submucosal invasion and a high probability of lymph node involvement.
Case series	More intensive treatment should be adopted for such tumors, whereas localized resection may be feasible for tumors without an elevated component.
Case series	The relationship of macroscopic shape of superficial esophageal carcinoma to depth of invasion and regional lymph node metastasis
Case series	Background: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and/or lymph node metastases (LNM) adversely influence the overall survival (OS) of patients with T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Although endoscopic therapy may be adequate for patients with T1a cancer, patients with T1b cancer require esophagectomy/lymphadenectomy. The authors hypothesized that LVI status would subclassify T1b cancers and facilitate new therapeutic strategies.
Case series	Methods: Ninety-nine consecutive patients with T1 adenocarcinoma were analyzed after they underwent esophagectomy/lymphadenectomy. LNM was assessed in all patients, and LVI was assessed in 89 patients.
Case series	OS was correlated with pathologic cancer stage in association with LVI and LNM. Results: The 5-year OS rate for patients with T1a tumors (88%) was superior to that for patients with T1b tumors (62%; P =. 001).
Case series	The 5-year OS rate for patients who had cancers without LVI (85%) was superior to the rate for patients who had cancers with LVI (36%; P =. 0001).
Case series	It is noteworthy that, for cancers without LVI, the 5-year OS rate for patients with T1b tumors (77%) was similar to the rate for patients with T1a tumors (90%; P =.
Case series	08), but it was superior to the rate for patients with T1b tumors that had LVI (27%; P =. 006). The presence of LVI and/or LNM resulted in worse 5-year OS (< or =37%) compared with the lack of LVI and/or LNM (88%; P <. 001).
Case series	The rate of LNM for patients who had T1b tumors without LVI still was 19%, and the relapse rate was 16%.
Case series	Conclusions: The current results demonstrated that LVI distinguishes the biologic behavior of early esophageal cancer, and patients who have T1b cancer without LVI have a clinical biology similar to that of patients with T1a cancer.
Case series	If LNM before surgery can be diagnosed with high sensitivity by better endoscopic techniques and/or molecular biomarkers, then a new therapeutic paradigm for T1b cancers could emerge.
Case series	Further research is needed on patients with T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Lymphovascular invasion as a tool to further subclassify T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma
Case series	Background & aims: There is controversy over the outcomes of esophageal adenocarcinoma with superficial submucosal invasion.
Case series	We evaluated the impact of depth of submucosal invasion on the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy and survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	Methods: Pathology reports of esophagectomy samples collected from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed.
Case series	Specimens from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and submucosal invasion were reviewed and classified as superficial (upper 1 third, sm1) or deep (middle third, sm2 or deepest third, sm3) invasion.
Case series	Outcomes studied were presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy and overall survival. Variables of interest were analyzed as factors that affect overall and cancer-free survival using Cox proportional hazards modeling.
Case series	A multivariate model was constructed to establish independent associations with survival. Results: The study included 80 patients; 31 (39%) had sm1 carcinoma, 23 (29%) had sm2 carcinoma, and 26 (33%) had sm3 carcinoma.
Case series	Superficial and deep submucosal invasion were associated with substantial rates of metastatic lymphadenopathy (12. 9% and 20. 4%, respectively). The mean follow-up time was 40. 5 +/- 4 months and the mean overall unadjusted survival time was 53.
Case series	8 +/- 4. 1 months. Factors significantly associated with reduced survival time included the presence of metastatic lymph nodes (hazard ratio [HR], 2. 89; confidence interval [CI], 1. 13-6. 88) and esophageal cancer recurrence (HR 6. 39, CI 2. 40-16.
Case series	14), but not depth of submucosal invasion. Conclusions: Patients with sm1 esophageal carcinoma have substantial rates of metastatic lymphadenopathy.
Case series	Endoscopic treatment of superficial submucosal adenocarcinoma is not advised for patients that are candidates for surgery.
Case series	Depth of submucosal invasion does not predict lymph node metastasis and survival of patients with esophageal carcinoma
review	Background & aims: Patients with esophageal high-grade dysplasia or mucosal esophageal cancer can be successfully treated by endoscopy.
review	We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine whether endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) correctly predicts the T-stage of early esophageal cancers, compared with pathology specimens obtained by using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or surgery.
review	Methods: Standard systematic review methods were used to perform reference searches, determine eligibility, abstract data, and analyze data. When possible, individual patient-level data were abstracted, in addition to publication-level aggregate data.
review	Results: Twelve studies had sufficient information to abstract and review for quality; 8 had individual patient-level data (n = 132).
review	Compared with surgical or EMR pathology staging, EUS had T-stage concordance of 65%, including all studies (n = 12), but only 56% concordance when limited to individual patient-level data.
review	Factors such as initial biopsy pathology (high-grade dysplasia vs early-stage cancer) did not appear to affect the concordance of staging between EUS and EMR/surgical staging.
review	Conclusions: EUS is not sufficiently accurate in determining the T-stage of high-grade dysplasias or superficial adenocarcinomas; other means of staging, such as EMR, should be used.
review	Endoscopic ultrasound does not accurately stage early adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia of the esophagus
meta analysis	Background: The prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC) depends on the depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis.
meta analysis	EC limited to the mucosa (T1a) can be treated effectively with minimally invasive endoscopic therapy, whereas submucosal (T1b) EC carries relatively high risk of lymph node metastasis and requires surgical resection.
meta analysis	Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in differentiating T1a EC from T1b EC.
meta analysis	Design: We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane, and CINAHL Plus databases to identify studies in which results of EUS-based staging of EC were compared with the results of histopathology of EMR or surgically resected esophageal lesions.
meta analysis	DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio, and a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was created. Setting: Meta-analysis of 19 international studies.
meta analysis	Patients: Total of 1019 patients with superficial EC (SEC). Interventions: EUS and EMR or surgical resection of SEC. Main outcome measurements: Sensitivity and specificity of EUS in accurately staging SEC.
meta analysis	Results: The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio of EUS for T1a staging were 0. 85 (95% CI, 0. 82-0. 88), 0. 87 (95% CI, 0. 84-0. 90), 6. 62 (95% CI, 3. 61-12. 12), and 0. 20 (95% CI, 0. 14-0. 30), respectively.
meta analysis	For T1b staging, these results were 0. 86 (95% CI, 0. 82-0. 89), 0. 86 (95% CI, 0. 83-0. 89), 5. 13 (95% CI, 3. 36-7. 82), and 0. 17 (95% CI, 0. 09-0. 30), respectively. The area under the curve was at least 0.
meta analysis	93 for both mucosal and submucosal lesions. Limitations: Heterogeneity was present among the studies. Conclusion: Overall EUS has good accuracy (area under the curve ≥0. 93) in staging SECs.
meta analysis	Heterogeneity among the included studies suggests that multiple factors including the location and type of lesion, method and frequency of EUS probe, and the experience of the endosonographer can affect the diagnostic accuracy of EUS.
meta analysis	Diagnostic accuracy of EUS in differentiating mucosal versus submucosal invasion of superficial esophageal cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Cohort study	Background: EUS is often used for locoregional staging of early esophageal neoplasia.
Cohort study	However, its value compared with that of endoscopic examination and diagnostic endoscopic resection (ER) may be questioned because diagnostic ER allows histological assessment of submucosal invasion and other risk factors for lymph node metastasis, eg, poor differentiation/lymphovascular invasion.
Cohort study	Objective: To evaluate how often patients were excluded from endoscopic treatment of esophageal neoplasia based on EUS findings. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care institution.
Cohort study	Patients: Patients with early esophageal neoplasia. Interventions: EUS, diagnostic ER. Main outcome measurements: Number of patients excluded from endoscopic treatment based on EUS results.
Cohort study	Results: A total of 131 patients were included (98 men, 33 women; age 66 ± 13 years). In 105 of 131 patients (80%), EUS findings were unremarkable.
Cohort study	In 25 of 105 patients (24%), diagnostic ER showed submucosal invasion (n = 17), deep resection margins positive for cancer (n = 2, confirmed at surgery), or poor differentiation/lymphovascular invasion (n = 6).
Cohort study	In 26 of 131 patients (20%), EUS findings raised the suspicion of submucosal invasion and/or lymph node metastasis. In the 14 of 26 patients (54%) with abnormal EUS findings, endoscopy results were unremarkable.
Cohort study	Diagnostic ER showed submucosal invasion in 7 of 14 (50%) patients, whereas no lymph node metastasis risk factors were found in 7 of 14 patients (50%), who subsequently underwent curative endoscopic treatment.
Cohort study	In 12 of 26 patients (46%) with abnormal EUS, endoscopy also raised doubts on whether curative endoscopic treatment could be achieved. After diagnostic ER, no risk factors for lymph node metastasis were found in 3 of 12 patients (25%).
Cohort study	Limitation: Retrospective study. Conclusions: This study shows that EUS has virtually no clinical impact on the workup of early esophageal neoplasia and strengthens the role of diagnostic ER as a final diagnostic step.
Cohort study	Do we still need EUS in the workup of patients with early esophageal neoplasia? A retrospective analysis of 131 cases
Cohort study	Importance: Distinguishing between mucosal and submucosal cancers is important for selecting the optimal treatment for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); however, standard procedures for diagnosing cancer invasion depth have not yet been determined.
Cohort study	Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) after conventional endoscopy for the evaluation of ESCC invasion depth.
Cohort study	Design, setting, and participants: This prospective single-arm confirmatory diagnostic study comprising 372 patients with T1 esophageal cancer was conducted at 41 secondary or tertiary hospitals in Japan.
Cohort study	Enrollment began on July 20, 2017; patients were enrolled in 2 steps, with the first registration occurring from August 4, 2017, to December 11, 2019, and the second from August 9, 2017, to December 11, 2019.
Cohort study	After the completion of all first and second registration examinations, patients received treatment and were followed up for 30 days, with follow-up ending on February 14, 2020.
Cohort study	Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had pathologically or endoscopically diagnosed esophageal cancer with T1 clinical depth of invasion.
Cohort study	Interventions: In the first registration, nonmagnifying endoscopy (non-ME) and magnifying endoscopy (ME) were used to diagnose cancer invasion depth.
Cohort study	In the second registration, patients from the first registration who had cancers invading the muscularis mucosa or submucosa were enrolled and received EUS.
Cohort study	After completion of the protocol examinations, patients received treatment with endoscopic resection or esophagectomy. The pathological results of the resected specimens were used as the reference standard for evaluating cancer invasion depth.
Cohort study	Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was the proportion of overdiagnosis of submucosal cancer (defined as invasion depth >200 μm) after receipt of non-ME and ME, with or without the addition of EUS.
Cohort study	The secondary end points were underdiagnosis, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Among 372 patients enrolled in the first registration, 371 received non-ME and ME.
Cohort study	Of those, 300 patients were enrolled in the second registration, and 293 patients received EUS. A total of 269 patients (217 men [80. 7%]; median age, 69 years; interquartile range, 62-75 years) were included in the final analysis.
Cohort study	The addition of EUS was associated with a 6. 6% increase in the proportion of overdiagnosis (from 16 of 74 patients [21. 6%; 95% CI, 12. 9%-32. 7%] after non-ME and ME to 29 of 103 patients [28. 2%; 95% CI, 19. 7%-37.
Cohort study	9%] after the addition of EUS; 1-sided P =. 93). All subgroup analyses found similar increases in overdiagnosis of submucosal cancer. The addition of EUS was associated with a 4.
Cohort study	5% reduction in the proportion of underdiagnosis (from 57 of 195 patients [29. 2%; 95% CI, 23. 0%-36. 2%] after non-ME and ME to 41 of 166 patients [24. 7%; 95% CI, 18. 3%-32. 0%] after the addition of EUS).
Cohort study	After non-ME and ME, diagnostic sensitivity was 50. 4% (95% CI, 41. 0%-59. 9%), specificity was 89. 6% (95% CI, 83. 7%-93. 9%), and accuracy was 72. 9% (95% CI, 67. 1%-78. 1%). After the addition of EUS, diagnostic sensitivity was 64. 3% (95% CI, 54.
Cohort study	9%-73. 1%), specificity was 81. 2% (95% CI, 74. 1%-87. 0%), and accuracy was 74. 0% (95% CI, 68. 3%-79. 1%).
Cohort study	Conclusions and relevance: This study found that the addition of EUS was not associated with improvements in the diagnostic accuracy of cancer invasion depth.
Cohort study	These findings do not support the routine use of EUS after conventional endoscopy for evaluating the invasion depth among patients with T1 ESCC.
Cohort study	Assessment of the Diagnostic Performance of Endoscopic Ultrasonography After Conventional Endoscopy for the Evaluation of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Invasion Depth
Case series	Background: Recent advances in endoscopic examinations have resulted in the detection of a larger number of early esophageal cancers; however, there have been many cases with clinically negative but pathologically positive lymph node metastasis (LNM).
Case series	In this study, we aimed to evaluate the discrepancy between the clinical and pathological diagnoses of LNM in patients with cT1a-MM/cT1b N0M0 esophageal cancer, and assess LNM size in these patients to clarify the presence of LNM that cannot be detected with current modalities.
Case series	Methods: This study included 50 patients who underwent surgery for cT1a-MM/cT1b N0M0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma between January 2012 and November 2016 at our institution.
Case series	The maximum size of involved LNs and metastatic nests were measured, and the distribution of LNM was investigated. Results: Of the 50 patients, 13 (26%) had LNM on pathological examination.
Case series	Lymphatic invasion was significantly more frequent in the LNM-positive group than in the LNM-negative group (p = 0. 005). The median sizes of 28 involved LNs and metastatic nests were 3 and 1. 6 mm, respectively.
Case series	Of these LNs, 20 (71%) were classified as micrometastases (≤ 2 mm). The involved nodes were distributed across three fields.
Case series	Conclusions: There was a discrepancy between the clinical and final pathological findings of LNM in patients with cT1a-MM/cT1b N0M0 esophageal cancer.
Case series	The detection of involved nodes with current modalities in these patients was difficult because of the small size of LNM.
Case series	Therefore, continued strong consideration for extended LN dissection is necessary in these patients to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
Case series	Discrepancy Between the Clinical and Final Pathological Findings of Lymph Node Metastasis in Superficial Esophageal Cancer
Case series	(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is used for pre-treatment staging and evaluation of response to pre-operative therapy in advanced thoracic esophageal cancers.
Case series	To evaluate the clinical significance of PET diagnosis of superficial thoracic esophageal cancers, FDG-PET was conducted preoperatively in 41 patients with such cancers without pre-operative therapy.
Case series	We compared the PET diagnosis with clinicopathological findings with respect to both the primary tumor and lymph node (LN) metastasis. Of the 41 superficial thoracic esophageal cancers, 21 (51. 2%) were PET positive for primary tumors.
Case series	Although tumor length and histological type did not correlate with FDG uptake by primary tumors, non-flat (elevated or depressed) tumors showed significantly stronger FDG uptake than flat ones.
Case series	Of 28 tumors infiltrating the deep submucosal layer, 19 (67. 9%) were PET positive, while only two (15. 4%) of 13 tumors infiltrating only the mucosa or shallow submucosal layer were PET positive.
Case series	Manova identified FDG uptake as the only independent risk factor for deep submucosal invasion (odds ratio, 7. 407; P = 0. 0279).
Case series	In 13 patients with pathological LN metastasis, although no LN metastasis was detected by FDG-PET, FDG uptake by the primary tumors was the only risk factor for LN metastasis (P = 0. 0318).
Case series	PET-negative tumors tended to reflect longer disease-free survival than PET-positive tumors, although this was not significant.
Case series	FDG-PET is useful for detecting tumors infiltrating the middle or deep submucosal layer (sm2/sm3), and for predicting LN metastasis in patients with superficial thoracic esophageal cancers.
Case series	FDG-PET is helpful for decision-making regarding treatment of such patients.
Case series	Evaluation of clinical significance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus
Case series	Purpose: To determine the preoperative ability of [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to predict pathologic tumor invasion and lymph node status in cT1N0M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Case series	Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 40 consecutive patients diagnosed with cT1N0M0 ESCC between February 2006 and April 2011. All patients were treated by esophagectomy with two- or three-field lymphadenectomy without neoadjuvant therapy.
Case series	We evaluated the relevance between clinical variables including maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the primary tumor on FDG-PET and pathologic tumor invasion and lymph node status using a logistic regression model.
Case series	Results: Tumors invaded the middle submucosal layer (SM2) and beyond in 21 (52. 5 %) patients, and 6 (15 %) had lymph node metastases.
Case series	The areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for SUVmax of the primary tumor used to predict factors involved in tumor infiltration to SM2 or deeper and lymph node metastasis were 0. 75 (p = 0. 006) and 0. 79 (p = 0.
Case series	025), respectively. The optimal SUVmax cutoff was 2. 7.
Case series	The findings of univariate and multivariate analyses identified SUVmax as the only significant preoperative predictor associated with tumor infiltration into SM2 or beyond and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, SUVmax ≥ 2.
Case series	7 of the primary tumor on FDG-PET was associated with poor recurrence-free and disease-specific survival (p = 0. 019 and p = 0. 012, respectively).
Case series	Conclusions: FDG-PET is helpful for diagnosing tumors that can infiltrate SM2 and beyond as well as occult lymph node metastasis of cT1N0M0 ESCC that are valuable indications in deciding therapeutic strategies for superficial ESCC.
Case series	Clinical Significance of FDG-PET to Predict Pathologic Tumor Invasion and Lymph Node Metastasis of Superficial Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Case series	Purpose: To assess the clinical usefulness and significance of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Case series	Methods: We examined FDG-PET for 80 consecutive patients with superficial ESCC without neoadjuvant treatment. Fifty-seven patients underwent radical esophagectomy, and 23 patients received endoscopic resection.
Case series	The FDG uptake index was evaluated with clinicopathological findings, and glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1) expression in primary tumors was examined immunohistochemically.
Case series	Results: The FDG uptake in primary tumors correlated with histology, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and Glut-1 expression. All patients with more than 4.
Case series	4 maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) had deeper invasion of submucosa. Among 16 patients with lymph node metastasis, only two were found to have lymph node metastasis.
Case series	FDG uptake, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and histology were found to be prognostic factors, and histology was an independent prognostic factor.
Case series	In FDG uptake-positive patients, depth of tumor invasion and histology were prognostic factors.
Case series	Conclusions: FDG-PET is useful for diagnosing tumors with deeper invasion of submucosa and is helpful in making decisions regarding endoscopic treatment for superficial ESCC.
Case series	Patients with FDG uptake-positive disease, deeper invasion of submucosa, poorly differentiated tumor, and poor prognosis should receive multimodal treatment.
Case series	Clinical significance of ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Case series	Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore nationwide trends in treatment and outcomes of T1N0 esophageal cancer.
Case series	Background: Endoscopic treatment has become an accepted option for early-stage esophageal cancer, but nationwide utilization rates and outcomes are unknown.
Case series	Methods: T1N0 esophageal cancers were identified in the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2014.
Case series	We assessed trends in treatment; compared endoscopic therapy, esophagectomy, chemoradiation, and no treatment; and performed a subgroup analysis of T1a and T1b patients from 2010 to 2014 (AJCC 7).
Case series	Results: A total of 12,383 patients with clinical T1N0 esophageal cancer were analyzed. Over a decade, use of endoscopic therapy increased from 12. 7% to 33. 6%, whereas chemoradiation and esophagectomy decreased, P < 0. 01.
Case series	The rise in endoscopic treatment of T1a disease from 42. 7% to 50. 6% was accompanied by a decrease in esophagectomies from 21. 7% to 12. 8% (P < 0. 01). For T1b disease, the rise in endoscopic treatment from 16. 9% to 25. 1% (P = 0.
Case series	03) was accompanied by decreases in no treatment and chemoradiation, whereas the rate of esophagectomies remained approximately 50%. Unadjusted median survival was longer for patients undergoing resection: esophagectomy, 98.
Case series	6 months; endoscopic therapy, 77. 7 months; chemoradiation, 17. 3 months; no treatment, 8. 2 months; P < 0. 01. Risk-adjusted Cox modeling showed esophagectomy was associated with improved survival [hazard ratio (HR): 0.
Case series	85], and chemoradiation (HR: 1. 79) and no treatment (HR: 3. 57) with decreased survival, compared to endoscopic therapy (P < 0. 01).
Case series	Conclusions: Use of endoscopic therapy for T1 esophageal cancer has increased significantly: for T1a, as an alternative to esophagectomy; and for T1b, as an alternative to no treatment or chemoradiation.
Case series	Despite upfront risks, long-term survival is highest for patients who can undergo esophagectomy.
Case series	Trends in Treatment of T1N0 Esophageal Cancer
review	Traditionally, early esophageal cancer (i. e. , cancer limited to the mucosa or superficial submucosa) was managed surgically; the gastroenterologist's role was primarily to diagnose the tumor.
review	Over the last decade, advances in endoscopic imaging, ablation, and resection techniques have resulted in a paradigm shift-diagnosis, staging, treatment, and surveillance are within the endoscopist's domain.
review	Yet, there are few reviews that provide a focused, evidence-based approach to early esophageal cancer, and highlight areas of controversy for practicing gastroenterologists.
review	In this manuscript, we will discuss the following: (1) utility of novel endoscopic technologies to identify high-grade dysplasia and early esophageal cancer, (2) role of endoscopic resection and imaging to stage early esophageal cancer, (3) endoscopic therapies for early esophageal cancer, and (4) indications for surgical and multidisciplinary management.
review	Early Esophageal Cancer: A Gastroenterologist's Disease
review	Early esophageal cancer involves the mucosal and submucosal layers of the esophagus. Early esophageal cancer is a heterogeneous group, and achieving optimal outcomes requires a multidisciplinary approach to align patients to their optimal treatment.
review	Although organ-sparing endoscopic resection has become the preferred management option for superficial esophageal cancer, it is not adequate in all tumors, such as high-risk lesions with poorly differentiated pathology, lymphovascular invasion, or deep submucosal invasion.
review	In such high-risk lesions, surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation may be required. In this article, we present our multidisciplinary approach to early esophageal cancer.
review	Multidisciplinary Evaluation and Management of Early Stage Esophageal Cancer
Case series	Background: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are the first-line treatments for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Case series	This study aimed to compare long-term clinical outcome and oncological clearance between EMR and ESD for the treatment of superficial esophageal SCC. Methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in five French tertiary care hospitals.
Case series	Patients treated by EMR or ESD for histologically proven superficial esophageal SCC were included consecutively. Results: Resection was performed for 148 tumors (80 EMR, 68 ESD) in 132 patients. The curative resection rate was 21.
Case series	3 % in the EMR group and 73. 5 % in the ESD group (P < 0. 001). The recurrence rate was 23. 7 % in the EMR group and 2. 9 % in the ESD group (P = 0. 002). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 73. 4 % in the EMR group and 95.
Case series	2 % in the ESD group (P = 0. 002). Independent factors for cancer recurrence were resection by EMR (hazard ratio [HR] 16. 89, P = 0. 01), tumor infiltration depth ≥ m3 (HR 3. 28, P = 0. 02), no complementary treatment by chemoradiotherapy (HR 7.
Case series	04, P = 0. 04), and no curative resection (HR 11. 75, P = 0. 01). Risk of metastasis strongly increased in patients with tumor infiltration depth ≥ m3, and without complementary chemoradiotherapy (P = 0. 02).
Case series	Conclusion: Endoscopic resection of superficial esophageal SCC was safe and efficient. Because it was associated with an increased recurrence-free survival rate, ESD should be preferred over EMR.
Case series	For tumors with infiltration depths ≥ m3, chemoradiotherapy reduced the risk of nodal or distal metastasis.
Case series	Long-term follow-up after endoscopic resection for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a multicenter Western study
Case series	Objective: Endoscopic therapy is increasingly being used in the treatment of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and mucosal adenocarcinoma (BC) in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.
Case series	This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence. Design: Prospective case series.
Case series	Setting: Academic tertiary care centre.
Case series	Patients: Between October 1996 and September 2002, 61 patients with HGIN and 288 with BC were included (173 with short-segment and 176 with long-segment Barrett's oesophagus) from a total of 486 patients presenting with Barrett's neoplasia.
Case series	Patients with submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. Interventions: Endoscopic therapy. Main outcome measures: Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate, tumour-associated death.
Case series	Results: Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients, photodynamic therapy in 55, and both procedures in 13; two patients received argon plasma coagulation. The mean follow-up period was 63. 6 (SD 23. 1) months.
Case series	Complete response (CR) was achieved in 337 patients (96. 6%); surgery was necessary in 13 (3. 7%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients (21.
Case series	5%); 56 died of concomitant disease, but none died of BC. The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84%.
Case series	The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection, long-segment Barrett's oesophagus, no ablative therapy of Barrett's oesophagus after CR, time until CR achieved >10 months and multifocal neoplasia.
Case series	Conclusions: This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe, with an excellent long-term survival rate.
Case series	The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up.
Case series	Long-term results and risk factor analysis for recurrence after curative endoscopic therapy in 349 patients with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and mucosal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus
meta analysis	Aim: For patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma, ESD was one of treatment modalities to remove the lesion safely and effectively.
meta analysis	We perform this meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and incidence of complication of ESD for patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	Method: Articles were searched in MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, Google scholar, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently searched and extracted data.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis of the efficacy of ESD was analyzed by calculating pooled en bloc and R0 resection rate. Incidence of complications such as perforation, stenosis and mediastinal emphysema was also calculated.
meta analysis	Pooling was conducted using either fixed-effects model or random-effects model depending on the heterogeneity across studies. Results: 21 studies (1152 patients and 1240 lesions) were included in this analysis.
meta analysis	The pooled en bloc resection rate was 99% (95% CI 99%-100%). Stratified by tumor size, en bloc resection rates did not show any significant difference. The pooled R0 resection rate was 90% (95% CI 87%-93%).
meta analysis	The pooled R0 resection rate was 85% (95% CI, 80%-90%) for large tumor and 92% (95% CI, 87%-93%) for small tumor (p < 0. 001).
meta analysis	Stenosis served as the most common reported complication with pooled incidence of 5% (95% CI 3-8%), followed by perforation (1%, 95% CI 0-1%) and mediastinal emphysema (0% CI 0-1%).
meta analysis	The incidence of postoperative stenosis decreased significantly after 2011 (2%, 95% CI 0-3%) compared with that before 2011 (9%, 95% CI 3-8%) (p < 0. 001).
meta analysis	Conclusion: ESD was an efficient modality for treating superficial esophageal carcinoma, with perfect en bloc and R0 resection rate and low complication rate. The most common complication of ESD was stenosis.
meta analysis	Although recurrence rate was low, patients should be maintained in a scheduled surveillance program.
meta analysis	Efficacy and complication of endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial esophageal carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Case series	Background and study aim: Endoscopic resection has been favored for the management of intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEGJ) over standard treatment with surgical resection.
Case series	Several previous studies have reported only short-term outcomes.
Case series	The aim of the present study was to report the long-term follow-up and outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic resection method, for the management of superficial AEGJ.
Case series	Patients and methods: A retrospective cohort study included 53 consecutive patients with superficial AEGJ who underwent ESD between 2001 and 2007 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.
Case series	Rates of overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival of patients with AEGJ after endoscopic resection were analyzed.
Case series	Results: The 5-year overall, recurrence-free, and cause-specific survival rates in the 53 patients were 94. 2%, 92. 3% and 96. 1%, respectively. The median follow-up was 6. 1 years.
Case series	En bloc, R0, and curative resection rates were 100 %, 79 %, 68 %, respectively. In 36 patients with curative resection, the cause-specific survival rate was 100 % and no recurrence or metastases were detected.
Case series	In 17 patients with non-curative resection, recurrence was found in three patients (17 %); two of the three patients died of their disease whilst one patient received chemotherapy.
Case series	Conclusions: Superficial AEGJ can be well controlled by ESD when curative resection is achieved.
Case series	Long-term outcome of endoscopic resection of superficial adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction
Case series	Objectives: Few studies have simultaneously evaluated the long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection (ER) for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) of the esophagus in Japan.
Case series	The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of ER for superficial esophageal cancer in consecutive patients. Methods: This was a retrospective study from a single institution.
Case series	From April 2001 to June 2012, 204 patients with SCC and 26 patients with AC were included from a total of 355 consecutive patients who were treated by esophageal ER at the Tohoku University Hospital.
Case series	Patients with submucosal invasion deeper than 200 μm and lymphovascular involvement were excluded. The intervention followed was endoscopic therapy.
Case series	Results: Overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence rates were evaluated as long-term outcomes. In the SCC group, during the median observation time of 36. 5 months (range, 6-120 months), 22 (10.
Case series	8%) patients experienced metachronous recurrence, 4 (2. 0%) patients experienced local recurrence, and 27 (13. 2%) patients died from causes unrelated to SCC. In the AC group, during the median observation time of 45.
Case series	5 months (range, 6-131 months), one patient (3. 8%) experienced metachronous recurrence and two (7. 7%) died from causes unrelated to AC. The cumulative 5-year overall survival rates were not significantly different between SCC (75. 9%) and AC (88.
Case series	9%) (P=0. 120). The cumulative 5-year disease-free survival rates of SCC (57. 1%) were significantly lower than those of AC (85. 2%; P=0. 017). The cumulative 5-year recurrence rates of SCC (32. 0%) were significantly higher than those of AC (4.
Case series	2%; P=0. 023). Conclusions: The rate of recurrence after ER was higher in patients with SCC than that in patients with AC.
Case series	These findings suggest that, by detecting AC of the esophagus earlier, a satisfactory prognosis without recurrence can be expected after ER in Japan, and more rigorous endoscopic follow-up is necessary after ER in patients with SCC than in those with AC.
Case series	Comparison of the long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for superficial squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in Japan
Case-control study	Background and objective: Esophagectomy has previously been the gold standard for patients with mucosal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus (Barrett's carcinoma, BC).
Case-control study	Because of the minimal invasiveness and excellent results obtained with endoscopic resection (ER), the latter has become an accepted alternative. However, few data have so far been published comparing the 2 treatment methods.
Case-control study	Methods: A total of 114 patients with mucosal BC who were treated surgically or endoscopically in 2 high-volume centers were included in this study.
Case-control study	Between 1996 and 2009, 38 patients with mucosal BC received transthoracic esophageal resection with 2-field lymphadenectomy (median 29 lymph nodes removed; all pN0) in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cologne.
Case-control study	Seventy-six patients with BC treated with ER followed by argon-plasma-coagulation of the remaining non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus in the Department of Gastroenterology in Wiesbaden were matched according to the following criteria: age, gender, infiltration depth (pT1m1-3), differentiation grade (G1/2 vs.
Case-control study	3) and follow-up period. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to epidemiologic and tumor criteria.
Case-control study	Complete remission (CR) was achieved in all patients in the surgery group and all but 1 patient in the ER group (98. 7%; the patient died of other causes before CR was achieved).
Case-control study	Major complications after surgery occurred in 32% of the patients, significantly more often than in the ER group (0% major complications, P < 0. 001). The 90-day mortality rates were 0% in the ER group and 2. 6% in the surgical group (1 of 38; P = 0.
Case-control study	333). The median follow-up periods were 4. 1 years in the ER group and 3. 7 years in the surgical group. During this period, 1 patient in the ER group had a local recurrence and 4 had metachronous neoplasia (overall recurrence rate 6. 6%).
Case-control study	However, repeat endoscopic treatment was possible in all of the patients, and the long-term CR rates in the surgical and ER groups were 100% and 98. 7%, respectively. No tumor-related mortality was observed in either group.
Case-control study	Conclusions: For patients with mucosal BC, both surgery and ER are effective treatment modalities. Surgery is associated with a higher morbidity rate and shows a risk for procedure-related mortality.
Case-control study	However, the recurrence rate is higher in patients treated with ER, so that thorough follow-up procedures are mandatory.
Case-control study	Comparison between endoscopic and surgical resection of mucosal esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus at two high-volume centers
Case-control study	Background & aims: Endoscopic therapy is emerging as an alternative to surgical therapy in patients with mucosal (T1a) esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) given the low likelihood of lymph node metastases.
Case-control study	Long-term outcomes of patients treated endoscopically and surgically for mucosal EAC are unknown. We compared long-term outcomes of patients with mucosal EAC treated endoscopically and surgically.
Case-control study	Methods: Patients treated for mucosal EAC between 1998 and 2007 were included. Patients were divided into an endoscopically treated group (ENDO group) and a surgically treated group (SURG group).
Case-control study	Vital status information was queried using an institutionally approved internet research and location service. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard ratios.
Case-control study	Results: A total of 178 patients were included, of whom 132 (74%) were in the ENDO group and 46 (26%) were in the SURG group. The mean follow-up period was 64 months (standard error of the mean, 4.
Case-control study	8 mo) in the SURG group and 43 months (standard error of the mean, 2. 8 mo) in the ENDO group. Cumulative mortality in the ENDO group (17%) was comparable with the SURG group (20%) (P =. 75).
Case-control study	Overall survival also was comparable using the Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment modality was not a significant predictor of survival on multivariable analysis.
Case-control study	Recurrent carcinoma was detected in 12% of patients in the ENDO group, all successfully re-treated without impact on overall survival.
Case-control study	Conclusions: Overall survival in patients with mucosal EAC when treated endoscopically appears to be comparable with that of patients treated surgically.
Case-control study	Recurrent carcinoma occurs in a limited proportion of patients, but can be managed endoscopically.
Case-control study	Endoscopic and surgical treatment of mucosal (T1a) esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus
Case-control study	Background: NCCN Guidelines of esophageal cancer recommend that endoscopic therapy is considered "preferred" for patients with limited early-stage disease less than or equal to 2 cm.
Case-control study	However, there is currently no definite evidence to support either endoscopic therapy or esophagectomy for early esophageal cancer larger than 2 cm. We aimed to explore the optimal treatment for this condition.
Case-control study	Methods: From January 2010 to June 2016, 116 patients with early esophageal neoplasia [high-grade dysplasia (HGD), lamina propria and muscularis mucosae (T1a) cancer, selected superficial submucosa (T1b) cancer without lymph node metastases] larger than 2 cm and treated either surgically or endoscopically were included.
Case-control study	Results: Endoscopic therapy was performed in 69 patients and esophagectomy in 47 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 43. 8 months in the endoscopic cohort and 49. 4 months in the surgical cohort.
Case-control study	The overall survival was similar between the two cohorts (97. 1% vs. 91. 5%, P = 0. 18). Survival without readmission for treatment-related complicates was also similar.
Case-control study	Minor and severe procedure-related complications occurred more often in the surgical cohort than in the endoscopic cohort (63. 8% vs. 43. 5% and 8. 5% vs. 0 respectively, P < 0. 05 for both).
Case-control study	Four patients in the endoscopic cohort had to undergo additional esophagectomy and were alive during follow-up. There were no procedure-related deaths in the endoscopic cohort, whereas two deaths occurred in the surgical cohort.
Case-control study	Recurrence occurred in nine patients in the endoscopic group (13%): six with local recurrence, one with residual neoplasia and two with metachronous neoplasia. None of them died after repeated endoscopic treatments.
Case-control study	Conclusions: Efficacy was similar between endoscopic therapy and esophagectomy in the treatment of early esophageal squamous cell neoplasia larger than 2 cm and endoscopic therapy was associated with fewer and manageable complications.
Case-control study	We recommend endoscopic treatment should be preferred selected for early esophageal neoplasia larger than 2 cm.
Case-control study	Comparison of the short-term and long-term outcomes of surgical treatment versus endoscopic treatment for early esophageal squamous cell neoplasia larger than 2 cm: a retrospective study
Case-control study	Objective: To evaluate the outcome following the strategy of endoscopic R0 resection (ER) plus adjuvant treatment (AT) versus esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell cancer in T1a invading muscularis mucosa (M3)-T1b stage.
Case-control study	Methods: We evaluated the outcomes of 46 esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) patients with T1aM3-T1b stage who underwent ER + AT from the Esophageal Cancer Endoscopic Therapy Consortium (ECETC) and compared these outcomes to 92 patients who underwent esophagectomy.
Case-control study	Propensity score matching (1:2) was used, with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) being compared between the two groups. Results: During a median follow-up of 32 months, there were no statistical differences (P = 0.
Case-control study	226) in OS between the two groups. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival in the esophagectomy group was 95%, 91%, and 84%, respectively. There were no mortalities within three years in the ER + AT group.
Case-control study	The RFS between the two groups was also not significantly different (P = 0. 938). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year RFS of patients in the esophagectomy group was 90%, 90%, and 83%, respectively, while it was 97%, 94%, and 74% in the ER + AT group, respectively.
Case-control study	The local recurrence rates between the two groups were not significantly different (P = 0. 277). Conclusions: This first multicenter analysis showed similar outcomes were found regarding OS and RFS between the two groups in T1aM3-T1b stage patients.
Case-control study	ER + AT may be considered in high-risk patients or for those who refuse esophagectomy.
Case-control study	Endoscopic resection with adjuvant treatment versus esophagectomy for early-stage esophageal cancer
Case-control study	Objectives: Endoscopic therapy for early esophageal cancer is gaining gradual acceptance in the United States.
Case-control study	However, little information is available regarding long-term outcome of endoscopic therapy compared to surgical treatment of early esophageal cancer.
Case-control study	We aimed to analyze outcomes in terms of cancer-free survival in patients with early esophageal cancer managed with either endoscopic therapy or surgical resection.
Case-control study	Methods: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute was searched to identify all patients who were diagnosed with stage 0 and stage 1 nonsquamous and squamous cell-type esophageal cancer between 1998 and 2003.
Case-control study	Data on demographic features, tumor characteristics, types of treatment received (endoscopic vs surgical resection), and esophageal cancer-specific mortality were analyzed.
Case-control study	Results: Data were available for analysis in 742 patients with early esophageal cancer. Only 99 (13. 3%) of these underwent endoscopic treatment (group A). The remainder of the patients was managed by surgical resection (group B).
Case-control study	In the Cox proportional hazards model, the relative hazard for esophageal cancer-specific mortality in group A was not different from that of group B (relative hazard [RH] 0. 89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0. 51-1. 56, P= 0. 68).
Case-control study	The significant predictors of survival were age at diagnosis (RH 1. 06, 95% CI 1. 03-1. 08, P < 0. 001) and absence of exposure to radiation therapy (RH 0. 32, 95% CI 0. 21-0. 48, P < 0. 001).
Case-control study	Conclusions: Patients with early esophageal cancer managed with endoscopic therapy have equivalent long-term survival compared to those treated with surgical resection.
Case-control study	These are the first population-based data that support the effectiveness of endoscopic therapy for managing these patients.
Case-control study	A comparison of endoscopic treatment and surgery in early esophageal cancer: an analysis of surveillance epidemiology and end results data
Case series	Objectives: Endoscopic therapy for early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) is evolving rapidly. Aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of stepwise radical endoscopic resection (ER) of BE containing early neoplasia.
Case series	Methods: Patients with early neoplasia (i. e. , high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or early cancer) in BE < or = 5 cm, without signs of submucosal infiltration or lymph node/distant metastases, were included.
Case series	Patients underwent resection sessions (cap technique after submucosal lifting) with intervals of 6 wk. Results: Between January 2003 and December 2004, 39 consecutive patients were included.
Case series	Therapy was discontinued in two patients due to unrelated comorbidity. Complete eradication of early neoplasia was achieved in all 37 treated patients in a median number of three sessions.
Case series	Complete removal of all Barrett's mucosa was achieved in 33 (89%) patients: 4 patients (all had undergone APC [argon plasma coagulation]) were found to have small isles of Barrett's mucosa underneath neosquamous mucosa.
Case series	Complications occurred in two out of 88 (2%) ER procedures: one asymptomatic perforation, one delayed bleeding. Symptomatic stenosis occurred in 10 of 39 (26%) patients and was effectively treated by endoscopic bougienage.
Case series	During a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients died and none had recurrence of neoplasia or Barrett's mucosa.
Case series	Conclusions: Stepwise radical ER is effective for selected patients with early neoplasia in BE; provides optimal histopathological diagnosis; and may reduce recurrence rate, since all mucosa at risk is effectively removed.
Case series	Use of APC should be limited to prevent buried Barrett's mucosa. Methods for prevention of stenosis should be developed.
Case series	Stepwise radical endoscopic resection is effective for complete removal of Barrett's esophagus with early neoplasia: a prospective study
Case series	Background: Additional surgical treatment after non-curative endoscopic resection for superficial esophageal cancer should be considered unless the tumor is pathologically proven to be categorized within the absolute indication of endoscopic resection.
Case series	However, the significance of this treatment strategy has been poorly evaluated until now.
Case series	Methods: Additional esophagectomy with lymph node dissection was carried out for a total of 34 patients with esophageal cancer pathologically diagnosed as in contact with or invading the muscularis mucosa (pT1a-MM) or submucosa (pSM) and/or accompanying vascular permeation after endoscopic resection.
Case series	The surgical results, pathological diagnosis after esophagectomy, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: The pathological diagnosis after endoscopic resection revealed pT1a-MM in 7 patients, pSM in 27 patients, and vessel permeation in 24 patients.
Case series	The approach to esophagectomy was via right and left thoracotomy in 26 patients and 2 patients, respectively, and was transhiatal in 6 patients.
Case series	Three-field lymph node dissection was performed in 12 patients, and the mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 72 (range 31-132). Pathological lymph node metastasis was noted in 10 patients.
Case series	Postoperative complications developed in 10 patients, and death due to pulmonary complications was observed in one patient. No postoperative recurrence was observed during the follow-up period (1-87 months).
Case series	Conclusions: Esophagectomy after endoscopic resection provides favorable disease control for esophageal cancer with pT1a-MM/pSM and/or vessel permeation, while strict consideration is required to determine the indication and procedure for surgery because of its invasiveness.
Case series	Esophagectomy for superficial esophageal cancer after non-curative endoscopic resection
Case series	Background: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate endoscopic resection (ER) combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of selected patients with early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Methods: Patients with Barrett's esophagus and neoplastic lesions <2 cm in diameter and no sign of submucosal infiltration, positive lymph nodes, or distant metastasis underwent diagnostic ER (cap technique).
Case series	Patients with a T1sm tumor in the resection specimen were referred for surgery; those with a T1m or a less invasive tumor underwent additional endoscopic therapy (ER, PDT, and/or argon plasma coagulation [APC]), or they were followed.
Case series	PDT was performed with 5-aminolevulinic acid and a light dose of 100 J/cm 2 at lambda = 632 nm. Results: Thirty-three patients underwent diagnostic ER.
Case series	Endoscopic treatment was not performed in 5 patients, who underwent surgery (4 T1sm; 1, patient preference).
Case series	Five patients were immediately entered into a follow-up protocol, and 23 received additional endoscopic treatment (13 additional ER, 19 PDT, 3 APC). Endoscopic treatment was successful in 26/28 patients; no severe complication was observed.
Case series	During follow-up (median 19 months, range 13-24 months), 5/26 patients had a recurrence of high-grade dysplasia: all were successfully re-treated with ER.
Case series	At the end of follow-up, 26/33 originally enrolled patients (79%) and 26/28 endoscopically treated patients (93%) were in local remission.
Case series	Conclusions: Endoscopic therapy is safe and effective for selected patients with early stage neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Endoscopic treatment of high-grade dysplasia and early stage cancer in Barrett's esophagus
Case series	Background: Endoscopic resection is widely used as an effective treatment for superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	However, the risk of lymph node metastasis increases in cases of muscularis mucosae or deeper invasion, for which additional treatment such as radiotherapy or surgery is required.
Case series	Accordingly, the current study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of salvage radiotherapy after non-curative endoscopic resection as an organ preservation strategy.
Case series	Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 37 esophageal cancer patients who received salvage radiotherapy after non-curative endoscopic resection.
Case series	The pathological invasion depths were the muscularis mucosae, submucosal layer, and muscularis propria in 14, 22, and one patient, respectively. All patients received external beam radiotherapy.
Case series	Among them, eight received intraluminal brachytherapy following external beam radiotherapy. Elective nodal irradiation was administered to all patients. Twenty-five patients received concurrent platinum and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.
Case series	Results: The median follow-up time was 74 months (range: 3-212). The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 64 and 78%, respectively. No local or regional lymph node recurrence was observed.
Case series	The causes of death included esophageal cancer in one patient, metachronous esophageal cancer in one patient, other malignancies in eight patients, and other causes in six patients.
Case series	Late cardiac toxicities ≥ grade 3 were observed in six patients, one of whom died of arrhythmia. Conclusions: Salvage radiotherapy after non-curative esophageal endoscopic resection is an effective treatment as an organ preservation strategy.
Case series	Although muscularis mucosae and submucosal cancer have a high risk of lymph node metastasis, our results suggest that elective nodal irradiation contributes to reduced regional node metastases.
Case series	Effectiveness of salvage radiotherapy for superficial esophageal Cancer after non-curative endoscopic resection
Case series	Background: Endoscopic treatment is one of the options for superficial esophageal cancer, but additional therapy such as esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is sometimes needed due to noncurative resection.
Case series	However, the outcome of additional therapy after endoscopic treatment has not been fully evaluated.
Case series	Methods: In 160 patients with superficial esophageal cancer, including 37 patients who underwent esophagectomy and 123 patients who underwent CRT after noncurative endoscopic resection, outcomes were investigated.
Case series	Results: The CRT group included more elderly patients than the surgery group, although there were no significant differences in tumor depth or lymphovascular invasion between the two groups.
Case series	Overall survival was significantly better in the surgery group than in the CRT group (5-year overall survival: 94. 3% vs. 79. 9%; p = 0. 039). Two (5.
Case series	4%) patients in the surgery group who developed lymph node recurrence achieved complete response by chemotherapy or CRT, and 9 of 16 patients (13. 0%) in the CRT group who developed recurrence underwent salvage esophagectomy or lymphadenectomy.
Case series	As a result, the 5-year cause-specific survival was 100% in the surgery group and 92. 8% in the CRT group.
Case series	SM2 invasion (≥ SM2) was significantly associated with recurrence after CRT, while lymphatic invasion was associated with lymph node metastasis in the surgery group.
Case series	Conclusion: Endoscopic treatment combined with esophagectomy or CRT can be a curative treatment option in patients with superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	However, esophagectomy rather than CRT should be recommended for patients with massive submucosal tumor invasion due to the risk of recurrence after CRT.
Case series	Clinical Outcome of Additional Esophagectomy After Endoscopic Treatment for Superficial Esophageal Cancer
Cross-sectional study	Background: Although the relation between hospital volume and surgical mortality is well established, for most procedures, the relative importance of the experience of the operating surgeon is uncertain.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Using information from the national Medicare claims data base for 1998 through 1999, we examined mortality among all 474,108 patients who underwent one of eight cardiovascular procedures or cancer resections.
Cross-sectional study	Using nested regression models, we examined the relations between operative mortality and surgeon volume and hospital volume (each in terms of total procedures performed per year), with adjustment for characteristics of the patients and other characteristics of the providers.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Surgeon volume was inversely related to operative mortality for all eight procedures (P=0. 003 for lung resection, P<0. 001 for all other procedures). The adjusted odds ratio for operative death (for patients with a low-volume surgeon vs.
Cross-sectional study	those with a high-volume surgeon) varied widely according to the procedure--from 1. 24 for lung resection to 3. 61 for pancreatic resection.
Cross-sectional study	Surgeon volume accounted for a large proportion of the apparent effect of the hospital volume, to an extent that varied according to the procedure: it accounted for 100 percent of the effect for aortic-valve replacement, 57 percent for elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 55 percent for pancreatic resection, 49 percent for coronary-artery bypass grafting, 46 percent for esophagectomy, 39 percent for cystectomy, and 24 percent for lung resection.
Cross-sectional study	For most procedures, the mortality rate was higher among patients of low-volume surgeons than among those of high-volume surgeons, regardless of the surgical volume of the hospital in which they practiced.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: For many procedures, the observed associations between hospital volume and operative mortality are largely mediated by surgeon volume.
Cross-sectional study	Patients can often improve their chances of survival substantially, even at high-volume hospitals, by selecting surgeons who perform the operations frequently.
Cross-sectional study	Surgeon volume and operative mortality in the United States
Case series	Background: Case-series reports from tertiary centers report improved outcomes for esophageal resection in recent years.
Case series	The objective of the current study was to determine trends in short-term outcomes after esophageal resection in a representative sample of United States (US) hospitals.
Case series	Methods: Observational study of all adult patients in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample who underwent esophageal resection from 1988 to 2000 (N = 8,657). Temporal trends of in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay were determined.
Case series	Analyses were performed for all hospitals after stratifying by hospital volume. The proportion of patients having surgery at high volume hospitals was used to assess changes in referral patterns. Results: The overall mortality rate was 11.
Case series	3% and revealed a modest but significant decline from 13. 6% to 10. 5% during the study period (p = 0. 001). Low volume hospitals had markedly higher mortality rates and showed no improvement over time (15. 3% vs 14. 5%).
Case series	In contrast, high volume hospitals indicated significant reduction in mortality over time (11. 0% vs 7. 5%, p = 0. 003).
Case series	Referral patterns changed over time with the proportion of esophageal resections performed at high volume hospitals increasing from 40% (1988 to 1991) to 57% (1997 to 2000).
Case series	Conclusions: The operative mortality rate for esophageal resection has declined over the past 13 years, particularly at high volume hospitals. Efforts should be made to understand the processes of care underlying this improvement.
Case series	National trends in outcomes for esophageal resection
Cross-sectional study	The reported operative mortality rate for esophagectomy for malignancy ranges from 2% to 30%.
Cross-sectional study	The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate the relationship between a hospital's annual rate of esophagectomy for esophageal cancer and the clinical outcome of the operation.
Cross-sectional study	Discharge abstracts of 1561 patients who had undergone esophagectomy for malignancy at acute care hospitals in California from 1990 through 1994 were obtained from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.
Cross-sectional study	The hospitals were grouped according to the number of esophagectomies performed during the 5-year period, and a mortality rate was calculated for each group.
Cross-sectional study	Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between a hospital's rate of esophagectomy and the mortality rate. Esophageal resections were performed in 273 hospitals.
Cross-sectional study	An average of two or fewer resections were performed annually in 88% of hospitals, which accounted for 50% of all patients treated. The mortality rate in hospitals with more than 30 esophagectomies for the 5-year period was 4.
Cross-sectional study	8%, compared with 16% for hospitals with fewer than 30 esophagectomies. This could not be accounted for by other health variables affecting the patients' risk for surgery.
Cross-sectional study	There was a striking correlation between a hospital's frequency of esophagectomy and the outcome of this operation.
Cross-sectional study	The results support the proposition that high-risk general surgical procedures, such as esophagectomy for malignancy, should be restricted to hospitals that can exceed a yearly minimum experience.
Cross-sectional study	A hospital's annual rate of esophagectomy influences the operative mortality rate
meta analysis	Aimed at reducing surgical deaths, several initiatives have attempted to establish volume-based referral strategies in high risk surgery.
meta analysis	The detailed analysis of the literature of the last 10 years, comprising 13 papers on esophageal cancer, shows a clear reduction in postoperative mortality with increasing case volumes per year.
meta analysis	Single papers have analyzed the main reasons for this phenomenon and showed that postoperative complication rates are lower in high-volume hospitals and management of complications is more successful.
meta analysis	Further, long-term prognosis is also correlated to case-volume. In conclusion, the analysis shows that only with the experience of more than 20 esophagectomies per year can a significant reduction of the mortality, down to 4. 9%, be achieved.
meta analysis	Based on this survey, surgery of esophageal cancer is a task for high-volume hospitals because of decreased postoperative mortality and improved long-term prognosis compared with low volume hospitals.
meta analysis	High volume centers for esophagectomy: what is the number needed to achieve low postoperative mortality?
Cross-sectional study	Background: Hospital mortality after esophagectomy has decreased from 29% to 7. 5% over the last decades because of improved surgical techniques and better perioperative care.
Cross-sectional study	Suggestions have been made that a further decrease in hospital mortality may be achieved by centralization of esophagectomies in high volume centers.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: The effect of hospital volume on hospital mortality after esophagectomy in the Netherlands was analyzed based on data from the Dutch National Medical Registry and the Dutch Network and National Database for Pathology over the period 1993-1998.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Annually, approximately 310 (range, 264-321) esophagectomies are performed in the Netherlands. Fifty-two percent are performed in 43-55 low volume centers (1-10 resections a year).
Cross-sectional study	Six percent are performed in 1-3 medium volume centers (11-20 resections a year). The remainder (42%) is performed in two high volume centers (> 50 resections a year). Hospital mortality is 12. 1%, 7. 5% and 4. 9% respectively (P < 0. 001).
Cross-sectional study	The high volume centers seem to see slightly more advanced tumors than the low and medium volume centers.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: There is a significant (inverse) relation between hospital mortality and hospital volume for esophageal resection in the Netherlands.
Cross-sectional study	Although hospital mortality is not the only measure for quality of care, these data suggest a potential beneficial effect to centralization of esophagectomy in the Netherlands.
Cross-sectional study	Hospital volume and hospital mortality for esophagectomy
Cross-sectional study	Background: Several complex surgical procedures had a reduction in mortality when they were performed at high volume centers.
Cross-sectional study	We hypothesized esophagectomy procedures for cancer performed at high volume hospitals in the state of Massachusetts would show a similar relationship.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Data were obtained from the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium on discharge information for all acute care hospitals in Massachusetts regardless of payer from 1992 to 2000.
Cross-sectional study	The influence of hospital volume was related to days in the intensive care unit, length of stay, discharge disposition, hospital mortality, and total cost.
Cross-sectional study	Hospitals were stratified to low volume hospitals (< 6 cases per year) and high volume hospitals (> 6 cases per year). Results: One thousand one hundred ninety-three patients underwent esophagectomy during this 8-year study period in Massachusetts.
Cross-sectional study	Three high volume hospitals performed 56. 5% of all resections (674 of 1,193). Sixty-one low volume hospitals performed 43. 5% of the resections (519 of 1,193) with an average volume of only 1 case of esophagectomy per year.
Cross-sectional study	High volume hospitals were associated with a 2-day decrease in median length of stay (p < 0. 001), a 3-day reduction in median intensive care unit stay (p < 0. 001), an increased rate of home discharges (as opposed to rehabilitation hospitals) (p < 0.
Cross-sectional study	001), and a 3. 7-fold decrease in hospital mortality (9. 2% vs 2. 5%; p < 0. 001). The odds ratio of death at a low volume hospital was 4. 3 (95% confidence interval, 2. 3 to 7. 7; p < 0. 001).
Cross-sectional study	The median cost was $755 dollars greater at high volume hospitals (p = not significant).
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Hospitals that perform a high volume of esophagectomies have better results with early clinical outcomes and marked reductions in mortality compared with low volume hospitals.
Cross-sectional study	Impact of hospital volume on clinical and economic outcomes for esophagectomy
Cross-sectional study	Context: Hospitals that treat a relatively high volume of patients for selected surgical oncology procedures report lower surgical in-hospital mortality rates than hospitals with a low volume of the procedures, but the reports do not take into account length of stay or adjust for case mix.
Cross-sectional study	Objective: To determine whether hospital volume was inversely associated with 30-day operative mortality, after adjusting for case mix.
Cross-sectional study	Design and setting: Retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database in which the hypothesis was prospectively specified.
Cross-sectional study	Surgeons determined in advance the surgical oncology procedures for which the experience of treating a larger volume of patients was most likely to lead to the knowledge or technical expertise that might offset surgical fatalities.
Cross-sectional study	Patients: All 5013 patients in the SEER registry aged 65 years or older at cancer diagnosis who underwent pancreatectomy, esophagectomy, pneumonectomy, liver resection, or pelvic exenteration, using incident cancers of the pancreas, esophagus, lung, colon, and rectum, and various genitourinary cancers diagnosed between 1984 and 1993.
Cross-sectional study	Main outcome measure: Thirty-day mortality in relation to procedure volume, adjusted for comorbidity, patient age, and cancer stage. Results: Higher volume was linked with lower mortality for pancreatectomy (P=. 004), esophagectomy (P<.
Cross-sectional study	001), liver resection (P=. 04), and pelvic exenteration (P=. 04), but not for pneumonectomy (P=. 32). The most striking results were for esophagectomy, for which the operative mortality rose to 17. 3% in low-volume hospitals, compared with 3.
Cross-sectional study	4% in high-volume hospitals, and for pancreatectomy, for which the corresponding rates were 12. 9% vs 5. 8%. Adjustments for case mix and other patient factors did not change the finding that low volume was strongly associated with excess mortality.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that when complex surgical oncologic procedures are provided by surgical teams in hospitals with specialty expertise, mortality rates are lower.
Cross-sectional study	Impact of hospital volume on operative mortality for major cancer surgery
Cross-sectional study	Background: Commonly performed elective gastrointestinal surgical procedures are carried out with low morbidity and mortality in hospitals throughout the United States.
Cross-sectional study	Complex operative procedures on the alimentary tract are performed with a relatively low frequency and are associated with higher mortality.
Cross-sectional study	Volume and experience of the surgical provider team have been correlated with better clinical and economic outcomes for one complex gastrointestinal surgical procedure, pancreaticoduodenectomy.
Cross-sectional study	This study evaluated whether provider volume and experience were important factors influencing clinical and economic outcomes for a variety of complex gastrointestinal surgical procedures in one state.
Cross-sectional study	Study design: Complex high-risk gastrointestinal surgical procedures were defined as those with statewide in-hospital mortality of > or = 5%, frequency of greater than 200 per year in the state, and requiring special surgical skill and expertise.
Cross-sectional study	Six procedures met these criteria. Using publicly available discharge data, all patients discharged from Maryland hospitals from July 1989 to June 1997 with a primary procedure code for one of the six study procedures were selected.
Cross-sectional study	Hospitals were classified into one of six groups based on the average number of study procedures per year: 10 or less; 11 to 20; 21 to 50; 51 to 100; 101 to 200; and 201 or more procedures per year.
Cross-sectional study	A hospital was included if at least one procedure was performed there during the study period.
Cross-sectional study	No providers fell within the 51 to 100, and 101 to 200 groups, so all analyses were performed for the remaining four volume groups that were classified, respectively, as minimal (10 or fewer procedures), low (11 to 20 procedures), medium (21 to 50 procedures), and high-volume groups (201 or more procedures).
Cross-sectional study	Poisson regression was used to assess the relationship between in-hospital mortality and hospital volume after case-mix adjustment.
Cross-sectional study	Multiple linear regression models were used to assess differences in average length-of-stay and average total hospital charges among hospital volume groups.
Cross-sectional study	We further analyzed mortality, length-of-stay, and charges at the procedural level to understand these subgroups of complex gastrointestinal patients.
Cross-sectional study	We also examined the relationship between provider volume and outcomes for malignant versus benign diagnosis groups. Results: Complex gastrointestinal surgical procedures were performed on 4,561 patients in Maryland from July 1989 through June 1997.
Cross-sectional study	The study population averaged 61. 6 years of age, was 55% male, 71% Caucasian, and had predominantly Medicare as a payment source.
Cross-sectional study	After case-mix adjustment, patients who underwent complex gastrointestinal surgical procedures at the medium-, low-, and minimal-volume provider groups had a 2. 1, 3. 3, and 3.
Cross-sectional study	2 times greater risk of in-hospital death, respectively, than patients at the high-volume provider (p < 0. 001 for all comparisons); longer lengths-of-stay, 16. 1, 15. 7, and 15.
Cross-sectional study	5 days at the low-, medium-, and minimal-volume groups, respectively, versus 14. 0 days for the high-volume provider (p < 0. 001 for all comparisons).
Cross-sectional study	Similarly, adjusted charges at the high-volume provider were, on average, 14% less than those of the low-volume group, which had the next lowest charges.
Cross-sectional study	Although mortality rates differed by procedure type, for each procedure, mortality increased as provider volume decreased, following the pattern found in the aggregate analysis.
Cross-sectional study	After case-mix adjustment, the risk of in-hospital death for patients with malignant diagnoses was significantly higher for the medium-, low-, and minimal-volume groups compared with patients at the high-volume provider, relative risk of 3. 1, 4.
Cross-sectional study	0, and 4. 2, respectively, (p < 0. 001 for all comparisons). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that increased hospital experience is associated with a marked decrease in hospital mortality.
Cross-sectional study	The decreased mortality at the high-volume provider was also associated with shorter lengths-of-stay and lower hospital char.
Cross-sectional study	Complex gastrointestinal surgery: impact of provider experience on clinical and economic outcomes
Case series	Background: Performing cancer surgery in high-volume centres may lead to improved outcomes. This study explored the relationship between annual workload and outcome following resection for carcinoma of the oesophagus and cardia.
Case series	Methods: The study was a retrospective case-note review of 1125 patients who had surgery for cardio-oesophageal cancer in the West Midlands region of England. Outcome measures were 30-day mortality and long-term survival.
Case series	Results: The overall 30-day mortality rate was 10. 0 per cent with a median survival of 14 months and a 5-year survival rate of 17. 2 per cent. Increasing age, advanced stage of disease and emergency resection independently affected outcome adversely.
Case series	Forty-one infrequent operators (fewer than four resections per year) performed 146 resections (13. 0 per cent), 18 intermediate operators (between four and 11 resections per year) performed 488 resections (43.
Case series	4 per cent) and five frequent operators (12 or more resections per year) performed 491 resections (43. 6 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate was greatest in the infrequent group (15. 1 per cent) compared with both the intermediate group (6.
Case series	6 per cent; adjusted odds 0. 40, P = 0. 004) and the frequent group (11. 8 per cent; odds 0. 73, P = 0. 28). There were no differences in survival rates between the groups, and no difference in outcome between high- and low-volume hospitals.
Case series	Conclusion: In this unselected population-based series there was little evidence of a trend of improving 30-day mortality rate with increasing workload, or between workload and long-term survival.
Case series	Surgical workload and outcome after resection for carcinoma of the oesophagus and cardia
Case series	Objectives: Esophagectomy is the standard treatment for T1 esophageal cancer (EC). Interest in endoscopic therapies, particularly for T1 EC, is increasing.
Case series	We evaluated the long-term outcomes after esophagectomy and examined the pathologic features of T1 cancer to determine the suitability for potential endoscopic therapy.
Case series	Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of esophagectomy in 100 consecutive patients with T1 EC. The primary end points studied were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
Case series	In addition to detailed pathology review, we evaluated prognostic variables associated with survival.
Case series	Results: Esophagectomy was performed in 100 patients (79 men, 21 women; median age, 68 years) for T1 EC, comprising adenocarcinoma, 91; squamous, 9; intramucosal (T1a), 29; and submucosal (T1b), 71. The 30-day mortality was 0%.
Case series	Resection margins were microscopically negative in 99 patients (99%). N1 disease was present in 21 (T1a, 2 of 29 [7%]; T1b, 19 of 71 [27%]), associated high-grade dysplasia in 64 (64%), and angiolymphatic invasion in 19 (19%).
Case series	At a median follow-up of 66 months, estimated 5-year OS was 62% and 3-year DFS was 80% for all patients (including N1). Nodal status and tumor size were significantly associated with OS and DFS, respectively.
Case series	Conclusions: Esophagectomy can be performed safely in patients with T1 EC with good long-term results. Many patients with T1 EC have several risk factors that may preclude adequate treatment with endoscopic therapy.
Case series	Further prospective studies are required to evaluate endoscopic therapies. Esophagectomy should continue to remain the standard treatment in patients with T1 EC.
Case series	Esophagectomy for T1 esophageal cancer: outcomes in 100 patients and implications for endoscopic therapy
Case series	Background: There are controversies regarding the extent of lymphadenectomy necessary during the course of esophagectomy for submucosal esophageal cancer.
Case series	The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term outcomes after esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy in patients with submucosal esophageal cancer and to investigate the prognostic factors in these patients.
Case series	Materials: A prospectively maintained database identified 105 previously untreated patients with submucosal esophageal cancer who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field or two-field lymphadenectomy. Median follow-up was 101 months.
Case series	Results: All patients received R0 resection. Ninety-eight patients had squamous cell carcinoma, and seven had adenocarcinoma. Lymph node metastasis was present in 38 patients (36. 2%), of whom 9 patients (23. 7%) had positive cervical nodes.
Case series	Thirty-five patients (33. 3%) had other primary malignancies. The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 74. 4 and 57. 4%, respectively.
Case series	The cause of death was recurrent disease in 16 patients, other malignancy in 12, and noncancer-related disease in 18. Univariate analyses demonstrated that other primary malignancy (P = 0. 0041), poor differentiation (P = 0.
Case series	0203), and angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0. 0347) significantly affected overall survival. There was no difference in survival between patients with lymph node metastasis and those without (P = 0. 9809).
Case series	Multivariate analysis found other primary malignancy to be the only independent prognostic factor (hazards ratio, 2. 295; 95% confidence interval, 1. 201-4. 386; P = 0. 0119).
Case series	Conclusions: Esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy for submucosal esophageal cancer results in 57. 4% survival at 10 years. Other primary malignancy is the only independent predictor affecting long-term survival.
Case series	Patients should be examined rigorously for other primary malignancy as well as recurrent disease during long-term follow-up.
Case series	Esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy for submucosal esophageal cancer: long-term outcomes and prognostic factors
Case series	Background: Mucosal (T1a) and submucosal (T1b) squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC) have often been analyzed together and are staged as the same category in the UICC/TNM staging system.
Case series	The difference in surgical outcomes between T1a and T1b ESCC therefore remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in surgical outcomes between T1a and T1b ESCC, and to investigate the prognostic factors in T1 ESCC.
Case series	Methods: A prospectively maintained database identified 145 previously untreated patients with pT1 ESCC who underwent radical transthoracic (n = 134) or transhiatal esophagectomy (n = 11). Median follow-up was 108 months.
Case series	Results: Of the 145 patients, 35 (24 %) had pT1a cancer and 110 (76 %) had pT1b cancer. Lymph node metastasis was present in 45 patients (31 %): 3 patients with pT1a cancer and 42 patients with pT1b cancer (P = 0. 0003).
Case series	The 5-year survival rate for the whole group was 77 %. The 5-year survival rate of the T1a patients was 94 % compared with 72 % for the T1b patients (P = 0. 0282). In multivariate analysis, only the depth of tumor invasion (pT1a vs.
Case series	pT1b) was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 2. 358; 95 % confidence interval 1. 009–5. 513; P = 0. 0477).
Case series	Conclusions: After esophagectomy, the prognosis of patients with pT1b ESCC is significantly worse than that of patients with pT1a ESCC. Infiltration into the submucosa is the only independent prognostic factor affecting survival.
Case series	These findings suggested that T1a and T1b ESCC could be staged separately in the next version of UICC/TNM staging system.
Case series	T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: long-term outcomes and prognostic factors after esophagectomy
Case series	Objective: Experience with treatment and outcome of superficial adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical management and identify predictors of survival.
Case series	Methods: Between September 1985 and December 1999, 122 patients underwent resection. Eighty-nine percent were men (mean age 63 +/- 10 years; range 35-83 years).
Case series	Sixty (49%) patients were in endoscopic surveillance programs and 48 (39%) had the preoperative diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second was less than 2 L in 12 (12%).
Case series	Seventy-five (61%) patients underwent transhiatal esophagectomy. Pathologic stage was N1 in 8 (7%). Pulmonary complications necessitating reintubation (respiratory failure) occurred in 10 (8%) patients.
Case series	Time-related survival models were developed for decision-making (preoperative), prognosis (operative), and hospital care (postoperative). Results: Operative mortality was 2. 5%. Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 89%, 77%, and 68%.
Case series	Preoperative decision-making factors associated with ideal outcome were 1-second forced expiratory volume of more than 2 L, surveillance, preoperative diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia, and planned transhiatal esophagectomy.
Case series	Prognosis was decreased in younger patients and in those with N1 disease. Postoperative respiratory failure increased mortality. Conclusions: Surgery is the treatment of choice for superficial adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Case series	The ideal patient has a preoperative diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia found at surveillance, good pulmonary function, and undergoes a transhiatal esophagectomy.
Case series	Discovery of N1 disease or development of postoperative respiratory failure reduces the benefits of surgery.
Case series	Superficial adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
meta analysis	Objectives: Optimal therapy for Barrett's mucosa is controversial. Photodynamic therapy has recently been introduced as a technique for eradicating Barrett's mucosa with high-grade dysplasia.
meta analysis	We sought to determine the incidence of invasive cancer and the outcomes after resection for high-grade dysplasia and to compare these results with published results of photodynamic therapy.
meta analysis	Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent esophagectomy for Barrett's esophagus from 1985 to 1996 and completed a metaanalysis of published results of surgery for Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia.
meta analysis	Results: Thirteen men and two women with a mean age of 63 years underwent resection for Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. The operation was performed through a transhiatal approach in nine and a transthoracic approach in six patients.
meta analysis	There was no operative mortality. The final pathologic study demonstrated dysplasia in four patients, carcinoma-in-situ in three, and invasive carcinoma in eight patients (53%).
meta analysis	All patients are alive and none of the patients with invasive cancer has recurrent disease. A metaanalysis of published results of 119 patients undergoing resection demonstrated an operative mortality of 2.
meta analysis	6%, an incidence of invasive cancer of 47%, and a 5-year survival in patients with invasive carcinoma of 82%.
meta analysis	Conclusions: A substantial percentage of patients with Barrett's mucosa containing foci of high-grade dysplasia have invasive carcinoma at the time of diagnosis.
meta analysis	Resection is accompanied by a low operative risk, achieves an excellent long-term outcome, and should remain the standard therapy for Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia.
meta analysis	Resection for Barrett's mucosa with high-grade dysplasia: implications for prophylactic photodynamic therapy
Case series	Objective: The authors determined the incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma after esophagectomy in patients endoscopically diagnosed as having Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia.
Case series	Summary background data: Barrett's esophagus is a well-recognized premalignant condition. There is controversy with regard to the optimal treatment of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Recognizing the morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy, some recommend a selective approach, reserving esophagectomy only for evidence of invasive cancer identified through endoscopic surveillance.
Case series	Other advocate esophagectomy for all suitable operative candidates.
Case series	Methods: The authors reviewed their experience between 1985 and 1995 with 11 patients with high-grade dysplasia arising in Barrett's esophagus diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy and treated by esophagectomy.
Case series	Results: All patients were white men ranging in age from 47 to 70 years. Ten patients underwent esophagectomy by the Ivor Lewis technique; one had a transhiatal resection.
Case series	Eight patients (73%) had invasive adenocarcinoma identified after esophagectomy; two (18%) had positive lymph nodes; one required a prolonged hospital stay for an anastomotic leak; two (18%) temporarily suffered delayed gastric emptying.
Case series	The authors' review identified 85 additional patients previously reported during the same period. Including the current series, 39 patients (41%) had invasive adenocarcinoma identified in the resected specimen.
Case series	A preponderance of early, potentially curable carcinomas are characteristically found in these patients.
Case series	Conclusion: A high incidence of endoscopically undetected invasive carcinoma strongly supports esophagectomy as the preferred approach for suitable operative candidates with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	The rationale for esophagectomy as the optimal therapy for Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia
Case series	Objective: The authors review the results and outcomes of esophagectomy (prophylactic esophagectomy) for patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade epithelial dysplasia (HGD).
Case series	Summary background data: The role of prophylactic esophagectomy for Barrett's esophagus with HGD is controversial, with some authors recommending surgery and others favoring endoscopic surveillance until biopsy diagnosis of carcinoma is made.
Case series	Methods: Between 1982 and 1994, 30 consecutive patients with HGD underwent esophagectomy and had the pre- and postoperative pathology reviewed at our institution.
Case series	The medical records were reviewed to determine patient characteristics, preoperative endoscopic data, surgical approach, operative morbidity and mortality, length of hospitalization, and treatment outcome.
Case series	Patients were divided into two groups based on whether invasive adenocarcinoma was found in the resection specimen (group 1) or not (group 2).
Case series	Results: The duration of reflux symptoms was 22 +/- 14 years for group 1 and 9 +/- 11 years for group 2 (p = 0. 05). There was one operative death (3. 3%) and six complications (20%).
Case series	In 13 patients (43%, group 1), invasive adenocarcinoma was found in the resected esophagus. The American Joint Committee on Cancer stage for these patients was stage I (8 patients), stage II (2 patients), and stage III (3 patients).
Case series	One stage I patient died of adenocarcinoma (72 months) in an incompletely excised HGD segment. Other stage I and II patients are alive without adenocarcinoma with an 18-and 63-month mean follow-up, respectively.
Case series	Outcome for stage III patients was one operative death, one noncancer death (6 months), and one patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma (26 months). For group 2 (57%), there were no adenocarcinoma deaths (40 months).
Case series	Conclusions: High-grade epithelial dysplasia is an indication for esophagectomy because of the prevalence of occult adenocarcinoma (43%).
Case series	Esophagectomy can be performed safely, and survival in patients with completely resected Barrett's esophagus and early-stage adenocarcinoma is excellent.
Case series	Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. An indication for prophylactic esophagectomy
Case series	Background: Barrett's esophagus, high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and invasive cancer are steps in the progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	While surgery is recommended for resectable invasive adenocarcinoma, a number of treatment modalities are advocated for HGD. The purpose of this study is to determine the outcomes after surgery for HGD.
Case series	Methods: We identified cases of HGD based on endoscopic biopsy in a single institution's databases from 1980 through 2001. Records were reviewed for patient characteristics, treatments, staging, and outcomes.
Case series	Results: In a 22-year period, 869 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 1,614 cases of Barrett's esophagus were diagnosed. Of these, 115 had HGD without pretreatment evidence of invasion.
Case series	Forty-nine patients with HGD underwent resection (mean age, 59 years) as initial treatment. Forty-seven had endoscopic treatment (mean age, 70 years) by photodynamic therapy or endoscopic mucosal resection.
Case series	Seven of the endoscopically treated patients failed, with three undergoing surgery and four observation. Nineteen patients were initially observed, with six eventually having surgery.
Case series	For the 49 initially treated surgically, one (2%) operative mortality occurred. Invasive adenocarcinoma was present in 18 (37%). The five-year survival was 83% for all resected HGD patients (91% for those without invasion, 68% with invasion).
Case series	Three of the eight deaths in those with invasion were from recurrent adenocarcinoma. Conclusions: Surgical resection of esophageal HGD can be performed with low mortality and allows long-term survival.
Case series	A significant percentage with an initial diagnosis of HGD will have invasive disease at resection. Surgery is the optimal treatment for HGD unless contraindicated by severe comorbidities.
Case series	Surgical treatment of esophageal high-grade dysplasia
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus has been advocated. Although long-term survival data exist, little is known about functional outcome and quality of life in this particular subset of patients.
Case series	Methods: The records of all patients who underwent esophageal resection for high-grade dysplasia from June 1991 through July 1997 were reviewed. Long-term functional outcome and quality of life were assessed using a two-part written survey.
Case series	Results: There were 54 patients (48 men, 6 women). Median age was 64 years (range, 36 to 83 years).
Case series	Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy was performed in 34 patients (63%), transhiatal esophagectomy in 10 (18%), extended esophagectomy in 8 (15%), and other in 2 (4%). Invasive carcinoma was found in 19 patients (35%).
Case series	Five patients (9%) were stage 0, 7 (13%) stage I, 3 (6%) stage IIA, 1 (2%) stage IIB, and 3 patients (6%) stage III. There was one operative death (1. 8%). Complications occurred in 31 patients (57%).
Case series	Median hospitalization was 13 days (range, 11 to 44 days). Follow-up was complete in all patients and ranged from 6 months to 9 years (median, 63 months).
Case series	Overall 5-year survival was 86% and did not differ significantly from a population matched for age and gender. Five-year survival for patients with only high-grade dysplasia was 96% and 68% for patients with cancer (p = 0. 017).
Case series	Quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. For patients with only high-grade dysplasia, the role-physical and role-emotional scores were better than for the control population (p < 0. 03).
Case series	For patients with cancer, the health perception score was worse than for the control population (p < 0. 03). Scores measuring physical-function, social function, mental health, bodily pain, and energy/fatigue were similar.
Case series	Conclusions: Although perioperative morbidity is significant, surgical resection of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus provides excellent long-term survival with acceptable function and quality of life.
Case series	High-grade esophageal dysplasia: long-term survival and quality of life after esophagectomy
Case series	The role of surgery in patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia is controversial.
Case series	The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of unsuspected early cancer and to evaluate surgical outcome in a cohort of patients with high-grade dysplasia.
Case series	Records of all 16 patients who underwent esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia from 1986 to 1991 were reviewed.
Case series	All had preoperative endoscopy with no gross evidence of carcinoma, and none had a preoperative diagnosis of intramucosal or invasive carcinoma. Intramucosal carcinoma was found in six (38%) resection specimens.
Case series	There were no cases of invasive carcinoma or lymph node metastases. One patient (6%) died 3 months postoperatively. The remaining patients are alive without evidence of recurrent cancer (range of follow-up, 2-68 months).
Case series	Early postoperative complications occurred in seven patients (44%). Late complications occurred in 11 patients (73%). Anastomotic strictures accounted for seven of the 11 (64%) late complications.
Case series	Complications were successfully managed conservatively in all but two patients. One required laryngectomy for chronic aspiration and another required a gastrojejunostomy for gastric outlet obstruction.
Case series	Intramucosal carcinoma that had been unsuspected is frequently found in patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia. Mortality associated with esophagectomy is low, and perioperative complications can usually be managed conservatively.
Case series	Esophageal resection is indicated in appropriately selected patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia.
Case series	Surgical management of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus
review	Barrett's esophagus is a common premalignant condition that results from chronic gastroesophageal reflux.
review	High grade dysplasia in the metaplastic esophagus is thought to be the last step in the metaplasia-to-carcinoma sequence that characterizes this disease. The management of high grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus is controversial.
review	Some investigators advocate a rigorous endoscopic surveillance program with biopsies, but this approach has been questioned because of its clinical impracticality, high cost, possibility of sampling errors, and difficulty demonstrating effectiveness on a reproducible basis.
review	Others advocate mucosal ablative therapy to eradicate the dysplastic and metaplastic epithelium.
review	This approach, still in its infancy, cannot be accepted as standard therapy at the present time because of limited follow-up, its questionable ability to completely eradicate the abnormal mucosa, the phenomenon of pseudoregression, and the patients require continued rigorous endoscopic surveillance.
review	Esophagectomy, on the other hand, can be accomplished with a low mortality rate in these patients.
review	We advocate this approach because a large number of them have invasive cancer in the esophagus despite a preoperative diagnosis of only high grade dysplasia.
review	In addition, the 5-year survival is excellent even if invasive cancer is present, and these patients are liberated from rigorous endoscopic surveillance for the rest of their lives.
review	For patients with high grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus who are poor operative risks, less invasive approaches such as mucosal ablation may play a role, but longer follow-up information is needed before this technique can be accepted even in this setting.
review	High grade dysplasia: surveillance, mucosal ablation, or resection?
Case series	Between 1982 and 1991, 19 patients (17 men and 2 women) with Barrett's esophagus, 10 of whom were in a surveillance program, were found to have high-grade dysplasia without evidence of invasive carcinoma.
Case series	Median age was 66 years (range, 30 to 79 years). Heartburn was the most common presenting symptom.
Case series	Esophagoscopy at the time of high-grade dysplasia diagnosis demonstrated normal Barrett's mucosa in 10 patients (53%), shallow ulcers in 3, slight mucosal irregularities in 2, small mucosal nodules in 2, stricture in 1, and shallow ulcer with stricture in 1.
Case series	Eighteen patients underwent esophagectomy. There were no operative deaths. Nine patients (50%) had invasive carcinoma. Postsurgical stage was stage 0 in 9 patients, stage I in 6, stage IIA in 2, and stage IIB in 1.
Case series	Median follow-up was 34 months (range, 2 to 116 months). Recurrent cancer developed in 2 patients. Overall 5-year survival was 66. 7%; 5-year survival for patients with stage 0 disease was 100% and for stage I and II disease, 35. 7%.
Case series	We conclude that high-grade dysplasia in an indication for esophageal resection because of the high rate of associated early invasive carcinoma and that resection can be done safely with the expectation of excellent long-term survival.
Case series	Because of these findings, we continue to recommend endoscopic surveillance in all patients with Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia: an indication for esophagectomy?
Case series	Hypothesis: The reported morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal cancer (IMC) have led asymptomatic patients to consider less invasive and possibly less effective treatments.
Case series	This study provides a critical assessment of outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQL) after esophagectomy for HGD and IMC. Design: Cohort analytic study. Setting: Section of thoracic surgery at a tertiary referral center.
Case series	Patients: All patients who presented between May 1991 and February 2003 with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Barrett esophagus with HGD or IMC were assessed.
Case series	Main outcome measures: Prospective analysis of postoperative morbidity, mortality, HRQL, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: Follow-up was complete in 36 patients. Mean follow-up was 4. 9 years (range, 0. 5-12. 0 years).
Case series	The incidence of postoperative invasive cancer was 39%, with stages ranging from I to IIB. There were 4 major complications (11%) and no operative mortality. Twenty-eight patients were alive, with a cancer-free survival of 85%.
Case series	The HRQL outcomes (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) were comparable with those of age- and sex-matched controls.
Case series	Significant differences in postesophagectomy gastrointestinal symptoms were seen with a decreased incidence of heartburn (P < or =. 001) and increased requirement for a slower speed of eating.
Case series	Twenty-two (79%) of the 28 patients described their current eating pattern as "normal or insignificantly impacted. " Conclusions: Esophagectomy for HGD and IMC can be accomplished with low morbidity and mortality.
Case series	Furthermore, most patients are able to resume a normal eating pattern, and postoperative HRQL can be equivalent to that of the general population.
Case series	Outcomes and health-related quality of life after esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer
Case series	To assess quality of life (QoL) and symptoms after oesophageal cancer surgery, a prospective nationwide population-based study was conducted in 2001-2005, including most surgically treated oesophageal cancer patients in Sweden.
Case series	Six months postoperatively patients responded to an EORTC quality of life core questionnaire (QLQ C-30) with an oesophageal-specific module (OES-18). Mean scores were calculated. Mann-Whitney test was used for group comparisons.
Case series	Among 282 patients, QoL was considerably reduced compared to a reference general population (P<0. 001), and functioning scales were similarly negatively affected; particularly role (P<0. 001) and social (P<0. 001) functions.
Case series	Younger patients scored worse than older. No gender differences were found. Dominating general symptoms included fatigue, appetite loss, diarrhoea, and dyspnoea, each significantly more pronounced than the general population (P<0. 001).
Case series	Eating problems, cough, reflux, and oesophageal pain were common oesophageal-specific symptoms.
Case series	Thus, patients who undergo oesophageal cancer resection suffer greatly from reduced QoL and several general and oesophageal-specific symptoms six months postoperatively.
Case series	Quality of life and persisting symptoms after oesophageal cancer surgery
Case series	Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes are important in assessing new approaches to the treatment of cancer. Neoadjuvant therapy is being used increasingly before surgery in patients with localized oesophageal cancer.
Case series	This prospective non-randomized study evaluated HRQL in patients treated by preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by surgery (multimodal therapy) or by surgery alone.
Case series	Methods: Data from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaires QLQ-30 and QLQ-OES24 were collected prospectively.
Case series	Questionnaires were completed at diagnosis, after chemoradiotherapy where applicable, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.
Case series	Results: The study included 202 consecutive patients with oesophageal cancer considered suitable for curative (R0) resection at the time of staging. Eighty-seven patients received chemotherapy combined with external-beam radiotherapy before surgery.
Case series	At baseline, 75 (86 percent) of 87 patients in the multimodal group completed questionnaires, compared with 72 (62. 6 percent) of 115 in the surgery-alone group. There were no significant differences in baseline global HRQL scores between groups.
Case series	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly reduced physical (P=0. 004) and role (P=0. 007) functioning before surgery, despite a significant (P=0. 043) improvement in the dysphagia score.
Case series	Oesophageal resection had a negative impact on global, functional and symptom HRQL scores at 3 months in both groups.
Case series	Most variables had recovered by 6 months in the two groups, but at 12 months physical and role functioning remained impaired in the surgery-alone group, and social functioning and financial worries in the multimodal group.
Case series	Conclusion: Although the multimodal regimen had a negative impact on HRQL before surgery, postoperative quality of life in patients who had multimodal therapy was similar to that in those who had surgery alone.
Case series	Prospective evaluation of quality of life in patients with localized oesophageal cancer treated by multimodality therapy or surgery alone
Case series	Background: Superficial esophageal cancer (SEC) is defined as esophageal cancer limited to the submucosal layers, including mucosal cancer and submucosal cancer, and is squamous cell carcinoma in most patients.
Case series	In 2000, the Japanese Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (JASTRO) Study Group for SEC published a consensus guideline of standard radiotherapy methods.
Case series	In this study, the interim treatment outcomes of SEC patients, who had received radiation therapy following the standard radiotherapy methods, were investigated.
Case series	Patients and methods: From 2000 to 2003, a total of 141 SEC patients were treated in 24 institutions in Japan.
Case series	Results: The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 95%, 90% and 90%, respectively, for patients with mucosal cancer and 90%, 81% and 70%, respectively, for patients with submucosal cancer.
Case series	The overall survival was better in patients who had undergone chemotherapy than in patients who had received radiation therapy alone, though the difference was not statistically significant.
Case series	The clinical target volume (CTV) did not influence overall survival and intracavitary irradiation did not influence the local control rate in either patients with mucosal or submucosal cancer.
Case series	Radiation-induced esophageal ulcer was not observed in this series. Conclusion: The standard radiotherapy methods are safe and effective for treating SEC.
Case series	However, the usefulness of chemotherapy and intracavitary irradiation and the optimal setting of the CTV should be clarified by future randomized trials.
Case series	Results of radiation therapy for superficial esophageal cancer using the standard radiotherapy method recommended by the Japanese Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (JASTRO) Study Group
Case series	Purpose: We analyzed our experience with external radiotherapy, combined modality treatment, or HDR brachytherapy alone to limited esophageal cancers.
Case series	Methods and materials: From 1991 to 1996, 25 patients with limited superficial esophagus carcinomas were treated by high dose rate brachytherapy. The mean age was 63 years (43-86 years).
Case series	Five patients showed superficial local recurrence after external radiotherapy. Eleven patients without invasion of the basal membrane were staged as Tis.
Case series	Fourteen patients with tumors involving the submucosa without spreading to the muscle were staged as T1.
Case series	Treatment consisted of HDR brachytherapy alone in 13 patients, external radiotherapy and brachytherapy in 8 cases, and concomitant chemo- and radiotherapy in 4 cases.
Case series	External beam radiation was administered to a total dose of 50 Gy using 2 Gy daily fractions in 5 weeks. In cases of HDR brachytherapy alone (13 patients), 6 applications were performed once a week.
Case series	Results: The mean follow-up is 31 months (range 24-96 months). Twelve patients received 2 applications and 13 patients received 6 applications.
Case series	Twelve patients experienced a failure (48%), 11/12 located in the esophagus, all of them in the treated volume. One patient presented an isolated distant metastasis.
Case series	In the patients treated for superficial recurrence, 4/5 were locally controlled (80%) by brachytherapy alone. After brachytherapy alone, 8/13 patients were controlled (61%). The mean disease-free survival is 14 months (1-36 months).
Case series	Overall survival is 76% at 1 year, 37% at 2 years, and 14% at 3 years. Overall survival for Tis patients is 24% vs. 20% for T1 (p = 0. 83). Overall survival for patients treated by HDR brachytherapy alone is 43%.
Case series	One patient presented with a fistula with local failure after external radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Four stenosis were registered, two were diagnosed on barium swallowing without symptoms, and two required dilatations.
Case series	Conclusion: High dose rate brachytherapy permits the treating of patients with superficial esophageal cancer with good tolerance.
Case series	Early tumors, located in the mucosa, might be treated by HDR brachytherapy alone or by a combined modality treatment in which HDR brachytherapy can take place like a boost. This approach may cure localized recurrences.
Case series	High dose rate brachytherapy for superficial cancer of the esophagus
Case series	Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of definitive radiation therapy in patients with superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	Materials and methods: Method of irradiation, local control rate, survival rate, and complications were assessed in 105 patients (89 men, 16 women; age range, 50-88 years) with superficial esophageal cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy at 15 hospitals in 1981-1990.
Case series	Results: All lesions were confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma. The overall 5-year survival rate was 38. 7%; the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 71. 0%. The 2-year local control rate was 83. 0%. Late complications occurred in 16 patients.
Case series	The prevalence of complications was relatively high in the group treated with intraluminal radiation therapy.
Case series	Conclusion: Local control and survival rates in patients treated with radiation therapy were excellent, especially in the group treated with external and intraluminal radiation therapy; however, the optimal dose and optimal combination of external and intraluminal radiation therapy should be further assessed.
Case series	Superficial esophageal cancer: multicenter analysis of results of definitive radiation therapy in Japan
Case series	Purpose: To assess the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) by using intraluminal brachytherapy (IBT) combined with external beam RT (EBRT) for submucosal esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods and materials: Between 1991 and 2005, 59 consecutive patients received definitive RT without chemotherapy.
Case series	IBT was performed after patients completed EBRT as a booster therapy for 17 patients, using low-dose-rate Cs-137 sources until 1997, and for 19 patients, using high-dose-rate Ir-192 sources thereafter.
Case series	The long-term outcomes were investigated with a median follow-up time of 61 months.
Case series	Results: Logoregional recurrences and distant metastases were observed in 14 patients and in 2 patients in the lung, respectively, and 5 patients were rescued by salvage treatments.
Case series	The 5-year logoregional control and cause-specific survival rates were 75% and 76%, respectively. The 5-year cause-specific survival rate in the EBRT group was 62%, whereas the corresponding rate in the IBT group was 86% (p = 0. 04).
Case series	Multivariate analysis revealed that IBT was the most powerful predictor of survival but did not reach a significant level (p = 0. 07). There were five esophageal ulcers in the IBT group, but no ulcers developed with small fractions of 3 Gy.
Case series	Grade 2 or higher cardiorespiratory complications developed in 2 patients (5. 6%) in the IBT group and in 3 patients (13. 0%) in the EBRT group.
Case series	Conclusions: Combining IBT with EBRT is suggested to be one of the preferable treatment modalities for medically inoperable submucosal esophageal cancer because of its preferable local control and survival probabilities, with appreciably less morbidity.
Case series	Usefulness of intraluminal brachytherapy combined with external beam radiation therapy for submucosal esophageal cancer: long-term follow-up results
Case series	Purpose: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and tolerance of external beam radiotherapy followed by high-dose-rate brachytherapy in inoperable patients with superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	Patients and methods: From November 1992 to May 1999, 66 patients with superficial esophageal cancer were treated with exclusive radiotherapy. The median age was 60 years (range, 41-85).
Case series	Fifty-three percent of them were ineligible for surgery owing to synchronous or previously treated head-and-neck cancer. Most of the patients (n = 49) were evaluated with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) or computed tomography (CT).
Case series	The mean doses of external beam radiotherapy and high-dose rate brachytherapy were 57. 1 Gy (+/-4. 83) and 8. 82 Gy (+/-3. 98), respectively. The most frequently used regimen was 60 Gy followed by 7 Gy at 5 mm depth in two applications.
Case series	Results: Among patients evaluated with EUS or CT, the complete response rate was 98%. The 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 57. 9%, 35. 6%, and 26. 6%, respectively. Median overall survival was 3. 8 years.
Case series	The 5-year relapse-free survival and cause-specific survival were 54. 6% and 76. 9%. The 5-year overall, relapse-free, and cause-specific survival of the whole population of 66 patients was 33%, 53%, and 77%, respectively.
Case series	Local failure occurred in 15 of 66 patients; 6 were treated with brachytherapy.
Case series	Severe late toxicity (mostly esophageal stenosis) rated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer scale occurred in 6 of 66 patients (9%).
Case series	Conclusion: This well tolerated regimen may be a therapeutic alternative for inoperable patients with superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	Only a randomized study could be able to check the potential benefit of brachytherapy after external beam radiation in superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	External beam radiation therapy followed by high-dose-rate brachytherapy for inoperable superficial esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of radiotherapy for patients with stage I esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: From 1995 to 2005, 34 patients with superficial thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma without lymph node metastasis were treated with radiotherapy at our institute.
Case series	Patient characteristics were as follows: median age, 68 years; range, 47 to 84 years; male:female, 33:1; performance status, 0/1/2/3 = 23/9/1/1; T1a/T1b = 4/30. Median fraction and total doses of external irradiation given were 2.
Case series	0 Gy and 60 Gy, respectively. Twenty-three patients had local irradiation to the primary lesion only; the remaining 11 patients received regional field irradiation, including one or 2 regional lymph node areas.
Case series	Only one patient received adjuvant intracavitary radiotherapy after radiotherapy. Thirty of the patients received concurrent chemotherapy, most of the regimens of which included cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.
Case series	Adjuvant chemotherapy was performed in 5 patients. Fifteen patients (44%) had coexisting malignancies. The median follow-up was 38 months (range, 8-107 months).
Case series	Results: The 5-year overall, cause-specific, and local-progression-free survival rates were 50. 4%, 91. 2%, and 81. 1%, respectively.
Case series	Of the 34 patients, 6 had in-field local recurrence, and one had recurrence in the esophagus outside of the irradiated field. Two patients experienced regional lymph node metastasis outside of the irradiated field, and one had distant metastasis.
Case series	Two patients received salvage surgery, and 4 patients received salvage intracavitary radiotherapy after local recurrence. A late toxicity greater than grade 2 was not observed in any patient.
Case series	Conclusions: Radiotherapy is an effective treatment modality for patients with stage I esophageal cancer.
Case series	Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for patients with stage I esophageal cancer: a single institute experience
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy remains the mainstay treatment for clinical T1bN0M0 esophageal cancer because pathologic lymph node metastases in these patients are not negligible.
Case series	Recently, chemoradiotherapy (CRT), which can preserve the esophagus, has been reported to be a promising therapeutic alternative to esophagectomy.
Case series	However, to our knowledge, no comparative studies of esophagectomy and CRT have been reported in clinical T1bN0M0 esophageal cancer.
Case series	Methods: A total of 173 patients with clinical T1bN0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus were enrolled in this study, 102 of whom were treated with radical esophagectomy (S group) and 71 with definitive CRT (CRT group).
Case series	Treatment results of both groups were retrospectively compared. Results: No statistically significant difference was found in overall survival, but the S group displayed significantly better progression-free survival than the CRT group.
Case series	Disease recurrence was observed in 12 S group patients and 20 CRT group patients. The incidence of distant recurrence was similar, while local recurrence and lymph node recurrence were significantly more frequent in the CRT group.
Case series	In the S group, 20 patients had pathologic lymph node metastasis. The progression-free survival of patients with pathologic lymph node metastasis did not differ from those without nodal metastasis.
Case series	In the CRT group, local recurrence could be controlled by salvage esophagectomy, but treatment results of lymph node recurrence were poor; only 4 of 12 patients with lymph node recurrences were cured.
Case series	Conclusions: Selection of patients at high risk of pathologic lymph node metastasis is essential when formulating treatment decisions for clinical T1bN0M0 esophageal cancers.
Case series	Comparison between radical esophagectomy and definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients with clinical T1bN0M0 esophageal cancer
Case series	Purpose: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of definitive radiotherapy for patients with superficial esophageal cancer.
Case series	Material and methods: From 1990 through 2006, 97 patients with stage I disease were treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. All patients were diagnosed with panesophagoscopy and computed tomography.
Case series	Chemotherapy was added in 61 patients, and intra-cavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) was used in 27 patients. Results: The patients were 90 men and seven women with a median age of 65. 7 years (range; 41-89).
Case series	At last follow-up with a median follow-up duration of 35. 7 months, 3 year-overall and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 81. 5% (95% C. I. = 73. 3-89. 7%) and 55. 8% (95% C. I. = 45. 2-66. 4%), respectively.
Case series	Shorter tumor length was a significantly favorable factor for the PFS rate (P = 0. 02) and local failure-free (LFF) rate (P = 0. 007) on both univariate and multivariate analyses.
Case series	Although the addition of ICBT had no apparent benefit for survival or tumor control, the rate of severe adverse effects including lethal esophageal ulcers, showed a higher tendency in patients receiving ICBT.
Case series	Conclusions: Our results regarding efficacy from the viewpoint of organ preservation are promising. Special care would be taken for the use of ICBT for patients with superficial esophageal cancer, especially if they have received chemoradiotherapy.
Case series	Retrospective analysis of definitive radiotherapy for patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma: Consideration of the optimal treatment method with a focus on late morbidity
Case series	Background: The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of invasive cancer in patients with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus and to verify whether a second endoscopy with multiple biopsies could improve the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis.
Case series	In addition, the mortality, morbidity and survival rates in patients with high-grade dysplasia having oesophageal resection were recorded.
Case series	Methods: Fifteen patients were observed from 1982 to 1998; the first seven patients were offered primary oesophageal resection after diagnosis. The other eight patients underwent a second endoscopy with a median of 12 biopsies examined.
Case series	All later underwent oesophageal resection. Results: Invasive adenocarcinoma was found in five patients, with a minimal difference between the first and second periods (two of seven versus three of eight). There were no perioperative deaths.
Case series	Early morbidity was observed in eight patients and late morbidity in four. The actuarial survival rate was 79 per cent at 5 years. The Karnofsky status was unchanged from preoperative values in 13 of 15 patients after a median follow-up of 46 months.
Case series	Conclusion: These patients with high-grade dysplasia had a 33 per cent probability of harbouring invasive oesophageal carcinoma but even a second endoscopy failed to identify patients with invasive tumour.
Case series	Oesophagectomy was performed with no deaths and remains a rational treatment in patients fit for surgery.
Case series	Oesophageal resection for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus
Case series	Objective: There has been an increase in interest in endoscopic therapy (ET) for intramucosal (T1a) or submucosal (T1b) esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of nodal metastases, lymphatic vascular invasion, and multifocal neoplasia in patients with pT1 esophageal carcinoma who underwent esophagectomy without preoperative therapy and assess their potential implication for ET.
Case series	Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who underwent esophagectomy without preoperative therapy for pT1 esophageal cancer.
Case series	A detailed review of all pathology reports was performed to identify relevant pathologic criteria including depth of invasion (T1a or T1b), cell type (adenocarcinoma/squamous), tumor differentiation (poor vs.
Case series	well/moderate), extent of Barrett esophagus (short segment [SSBE] and long segment [LSBE]), nodal status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and the presence of multifocal neoplasia (MFN) (high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma).
Case series	Overall survival and disease-specific survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: There were 75 consecutive patients (58 men, 17 women) between January 1994 and September 2006. Median age was 68 years. Hospital mortality was 2.
Case series	6% (2 of 75). Thirty patients had T1a and 45 had T1b. Sixty patients had adenocarcinoma. Nodal metastases were present in 2 of 30 (6%) T1a and 8 of 45 (17. 5%) T1b tumors.
Case series	MFN was present in 30% (9 of 30) of T1a tumors and 29% (13 of 45) of T1b tumors. All 9 patients with LVI had T1b tumors. Collectively, 10 of 30 (33. 3%) patients with T1a and 25 of 45 (58%) with T1b had MFN, LVI, or nodal metastases.
Case series	Forty-nine patients had adenocarcinoma with associated BE (23 SSBE, 26 LSBE). There was no difference between patients with SSBE and those with LSBE in the incidence of nodal disease (2 of 23 vs.
Case series	2 of 26) but a significant difference in the incidence of MFN (3 of 23 vs. 13 of 26, P = 0. 006). Four patients with squamous carcinoma had nodal metastases and 5 had MFN. Overall 5-year survival was 78% (T1a:90% T1b: 71%, P = 0. 07).
Case series	Five-year disease-specific survival was 86. 5% (T1a: 96. 7%, T1b: 79. 6%, P = 0. 06).
Case series	Conclusion: The combined high incidence of MFN, LVI, and occult nodal metastases does not support the use of ET in patients with T1 esophageal cancer regardless of depth of invasion, cell type, differentiation or extent of BE.
Case series	ET may be of value in patients in whom surgical risk is considered prohibitive.
Case series	Multifocal neoplasia and nodal metastases in T1 esophageal carcinoma: implications for endoscopic treatment
Case series	Background: Esophagectomy is a complex operation and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to lower morbidity, we have adopted a minimally invasive approach to esophagectomy.
Case series	Objectives: Our primary objective was to evaluate the outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) in a large group of patients.
Case series	Our secondary objective was to compare the modified McKeown minimally invasive approach (videothoracoscopic surgery, laparoscopy, neck anastomosis [MIE-neck]) with our current approach, a modified Ivor Lewis approach (laparoscopy, videothoracoscopic surgery, chest anastomosis [MIE-chest]).
Case series	Methods: We reviewed 1033 consecutive patients undergoing MIE. Elective operation was performed on 1011 patients; 22 patients with nonelective operations were excluded. Patients were stratified by surgical approach and perioperative outcomes analyzed.
Case series	The primary endpoint studied was 30-day mortality. Results: The MIE-neck was performed in 481 (48%) and MIE-Ivor Lewis in 530 (52%). Patients undergoing MIE-Ivor Lewis were operated in the current era. The median number of lymph nodes resected was 21.
Case series	The operative mortality was 1. 68%. Median length of stay (8 days) and ICU stay (2 days) were similar between the 2 approaches. Mortality rate was 0. 9%, and recurrent nerve injury was less frequent in the Ivor Lewis MIE group (P < 0. 001).
Case series	Conclusions: MIE in our center resulted in acceptable lymph node resection, postoperative outcomes, and low mortality using either an MIE-neck or an MIE-chest approach.
Case series	The MIE Ivor Lewis approach was associated with reduced recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and mortality of 0. 9% and is now our preferred approach. Minimally invasive esophagectomy can be performed safely, with good results in an experienced center.
Case series	Outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy: review of over 1000 patients
review	Background: This article reviews the evidence on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery for gastric and oesophageal cancer.
review	Methods: An electronic search of the literature between 1997 and 2007 was undertaken to identify primary studies and systematic reviews; studies were retrieved and analysed using predetermined criteria.
review	Information on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery for gastric and oesophageal cancer was recorded and analysed. Results: From 188 abstracts reviewed, 46 eligible studies were identified, 23 on oesophagectomy and 23 on gastrectomy.
review	There were 35 case series, eight case-matched studies and three randomized controlled trials.
review	Compared with the contemporary results of open surgery, reports on minimally invasive surgery indicate potentially favourable outcomes in terms of operative blood loss, recovery of gastrointestinal function and hospital stay.
review	However, the quality of the data was generally poor, with many potential sources of bias. Conclusion: Minimally invasive surgery is feasible but evidence of benefit is currently weak.
review	Systematic review of minimally invasive resection for gastro-oesophageal cancer
Case series	Objective: To assess the extent of disease in patients with pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma and to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of a limited surgical approach.
Case series	Summary background data: Radical esophagectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy is widely advocated as the treatment of choice in patients with early adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus.
Case series	This approach, however, is associated with substantial complications and long-term side effects. The extent of resection necessary to achieve cure in such patients is not clear.
Case series	Methods: Seventy-one patients with pT1 adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus underwent transmediastinal or transthoracic esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy.
Case series	Twenty-four patients with uT1N0 tumors underwent a limited resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction, regional lymphadenectomy, and reconstruction by interposition of an isoperistaltic pedicled jejunal segment.
Case series	The two groups were compared for extent and multicentricity of the primary tumor and associated high-grade dysplasia, pattern of lymph node metastases, complications, deaths, and outcome of surgical treatment.
Case series	Results: Multicentric tumor growth or associated high-grade dysplasia was observed in 60. 6% of the resection specimens.
Case series	Complete resection of the tumor and the entire segment with intestinal metaplasia was achieved in all patients, irrespective of the surgical approach. Patients undergoing limited resection had fewer complications.
Case series	Lymph node metastases or micrometastases were present in none of the 38 patients with tumors limited to the mucosa (pT1a) versus 10 of the 56 (17. 9%) patients with tumors invading the submucosa (pT1b).
Case series	Distant lymph node metastases occurred only in patients with more than three positive regional lymph nodes. Lymph node metastases were prognostic, but the pT1a/pT1b category and the surgical approach were not.
Case series	The mean Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index after limited resection did not differ from that of healthy controls: 20 of the 24 patients were completely asymptomatic.
Case series	Conclusions: In patients with early adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus, resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction, with regional lymphadenectomy and jejunal interposition, is an attractive limited surgical alternative to radical esophagectomy.
Case series	Limited resection for early adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus
Case series	Objective: Although stomach is the best choice for reconstruction after esophagectomy from the viewpoint of safety and ease, an intrathoracic stomach, nevertheless, is a poor long-term substitute.
Case series	This anatomical configuration abolishes normal antireflux mechanisms and places the acid-excreting stomach subject to biliary reflux, moreover, in an adjacent position to the esophagus within the negative-pressure environment of the thorax.
Case series	Methods: Between 1995 and 2002, 27 patients with high-grade neoplasia-as early Barrett's carcinoma-or non-dilatable peptic stricture underwent limited surgical resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction.
Case series	In 11 of these cases, the reconstruction was performed with gastro-jejuno-duodenal interposition. The long-term functional results of this specially adapted form of interposition reconstruction have been evaluated.
Case series	The postoperative follow-up period ranged between 24 and 95 months (mean 68 months). Nine patients (9/11=81. 8%) have agreed to undergo endoscopy, radiographic contrast-swallow examination, and 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH and bilirubin monitoring.
Case series	Results: Three out of nine patients (3/9=33%) demonstrated abnormal levels of esophageal acid exposure during the 24-h study period, whilst none had any evidence of bilirubin exposure in the esophageal remnant.
Case series	Endoscopy revealed that three patients had reflux esophagitis in the remnant esophagus: Los Angeles A=2, C=1. No stomal or jejunal ulceration at the gastro-jejunal anastomosis could be observed.
Case series	Histopathologic assessment of the squamous epithelial biopsies demonstrated microscopic evidence of inflammation: minor in two cases, moderate in one and major in one case; however, none of them had evidence of columnar metaplasia in the esophageal remnant at a median of 68 months after surgery.
Case series	The majority of the patients have been doing well since the operation: 8/9 (88%)=Visick I-II.
Case series	Conclusions: Gastro-jejuno-duodenal interposition represents an adequate 'second-best' method of choice if technical difficulties emerge with jejunal or colon interposition following limited resection of the esophagus performed due to early Barett's carcinoma or non-dilatable peptic stricture.
Case series	The place of gastro-jejuno-duodenal interposition following limited esophageal resection
review	The need for radical resection and extensive lymphadenectomy for early adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus has recently been challenged.
review	Limited surgical resection and endoscopic mucosal ablation techniques are increasingly proposed and used as less invasive alternatives.
review	Available data indicate that a limited resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction with jejunal interposition is associated with less morbidity and mortality, provides similar oncologic results, and offers a better quality of life as compared with radical esophagectomy.
review	In contrast, endoscopic ablation and mucosectomy techniques are still plagued by high tumor recurrence rates, particularly in patients with incomplete removal of the underlying Barrett's mucosa, multicentric tumors, or tumors invading into the submucosa.
review	Attention to technical details of limited resection and jejunal interposition is, however, required to avoid complications, poor functional results, and the need for reintervention.
review	Limited surgical resection and jejunal interposition for early adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus
Case series	Background & aims: Although esophagectomy is the standard of care for treating early adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, the procedure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Case series	For these patients, the multimodal approach of endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy (EMR/PDT) may be a viable, less invasive option.
Case series	Methods: A retrospective review (1996-2001) of all patients undergoing either combined EMR/PDT group or esophagectomy (SURG) for early-stage Barrett's adenocarcinoma was performed.
Case series	Data were collected on patient demographics, tumor staging, procedure-related morbidity and mortality, persistence or recurrence of cancer, and cancer-related deaths after therapy. Differences in outcomes between the 2 groups were assessed.
Case series	Results: Twenty-four patients were identified in the EMR/PDT group and 64 in the SURG group. The SURG group was found to have a significantly higher procedure-related complication rate compared with the EMR/PDT group (31 vs. 4; P < 0. 01).
Case series	There were no procedure-related deaths in the EMR/PDT group, whereas one death occurred in the SURG group as a result of complications.
Case series	Eighty-three percent of patients (20 of 24) in the EMR/PDT group and all patients in the SURG group remained free of cancer over a follow-up of 12 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 3 months, respectively.
Case series	Four patients in the EMR/PDT group failed to respond to therapy; 2 of them underwent alternate therapies and are free of disease, whereas the other 2 died of unrelated causes.
Case series	Conclusions: The combination of EMR/PDT seems to be a viable and less morbid alternative to standard esophagectomy in patients presenting with early Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	A prospective randomized, controlled trial of EMR/PDT compared with esophagectomy for managing early adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus may be warranted.
Case series	Combined endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy versus esophagectomy for management of early adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus
Case series	Background: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and photodynamic therapy have been proposed as treatments for early stage cancers. EMR is limited by its focal nature whereas photodynamic therapy is dependent on precise staging.
Case series	The combination of EMR and photodynamic therapy were studied in the treatment of superficial cancer in patients with Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	Methods: Seventeen consecutive nonsurgical patients with superficial cancers underwent EMR followed by photodynamic therapy with a porphyrin photosensitizer. Photoradiation was performed at 630 nm for a total dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser.
Case series	Results: Seventeen patients (15 men; mean age 69 +/- 13 years) underwent EMR. The mean diameter of mucosal resection was 1 cm. The margins were involved by cancer in 3 cases. EMR improved staging in 8 patients (47%).
Case series	Sixteen (94%) patients remained in remission (median follow-up 13 months). Complications included minor bleeding after EMR in 1 patient (6%), stricture in 5 (30%), cutaneous phototoxicity in 2 (12%), and supraventricular tachycardia in 1 patient (6%).
Case series	Conclusions: Combined EMR and photodynamic therapy appears to be an effective and safe therapy for superficial esophageal cancer within Barrett's esophagus.
Case series	This combination improves cancer staging, removes the superficial cancer, and eliminates remaining mucosa at risk for cancer development.
Case series	Combined endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy for esophageal neoplasia within Barrett's esophagus
Case series	Objective: To assess the dose-response, safety, and efficacy of circumferential endoscopic ablation of Barrett's esophagus (BE) by using an endoscopic balloon-based ablation device (HALO360 System).
Case series	Design: This study was conducted in 2 serial phases (dosimetry phase and effectiveness phase) to evaluate a balloon-based ablation device that delivers a pre-set amount of energy density (J/cm2) to BE tissue.
Case series	The dosimetry phase evaluated the dose-response and the safety of delivering 6 to 12 J/cm2. The effectiveness phase used 10 J/cm2 (delivered twice [x2]) for all patients, followed by EGD with biopsies at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
Case series	A second ablation procedure was performed if BE was present at 1 or 3 months. Patients received esomeprazole 40 mg twice a day for 1 month after ablation, and 40 mg every day thereafter.
Case series	Postablation symptoms were quantified by using a 14-day symptom diary (scale, 0-100). A complete response (CR) was defined as all biopsy specimens negative for BE at 12 months. Setting: Eight U. S. centers, between September 2003 and September 2005.
Case series	Patients: Patients were 18 to 75 years of age, with a diagnosis of BE (without dysplasia), with histopathology reconfirmation of the diagnosis within 6 months of enrollment. Results: In the dosimetry phase, 32 patients (29 men; mean age, 56.
Case series	8 years) were enrolled. Median symptom scores returned to a score of 0 of 100 by day 3.
Case series	There were no dose-related serious adverse events, and the outcomes at 1 and 3 months permitted the selection of 10 J/cm2 (x2) for the subsequent effectiveness phase of the study.
Case series	In the effectiveness phase, 70 patients (52 men, 18 women; mean age, 55. 7 years) were enrolled. Median symptom scores returned to a score of 0 of 100 by day 4. At 12 months (n = 69; mean, 1. 5 sessions), a CR for BE was achieved in 70% of patients.
Case series	There were no strictures and no buried glandular mucosa in either study phase (4306 biopsy fragments evaluated).
Case series	Conclusions: Circumferential ablation of nondysplastic BE by using this balloon-based ablation device can be performed with no subsequent strictures or buried glands and with complete elimination of BE in 70% of patients at 1-year follow-up.
Case series	Balloon-based, circumferential, endoscopic radiofrequency ablation of Barrett's esophagus: 1-year follow-up of 100 patients
Case series	Although surgery is traditionally the standard of care for esophageal cancer, esophagectomy carries significant morbidity. Alternative endoscopic therapies are needed for patients who are not candidates for conventional treatment.
Case series	The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of spray cryotherapy of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Case series	This study includes patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who had failed or were not candidates for conventional therapy enrolled retrospectively and prospectively in an open-label registry and patients in a retrospective cohort from 11 academic and community practices.
Case series	Endoscopic spray cryotherapy was performed until biopsy proven local tumor eradication or until treatment was halted due to progression of disease, patient withdrawal or comorbidities.
Case series	Eighty-eight patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (median age 76, 80. 7% male, mean length 5. 1 cm) underwent 359 treatments (mean 4. 4 per patient). Tumor stages included 39 with T1a, 25 with T1b, 9 with unspecified T1, and 15 with T2.
Case series	Eighty-six patients completed treatment with complete response of intraluminal disease in 55. 8%, including complete response in 76. 3% for T1a, 45. 8% for T1b, 66. 2% for all T1, and 6. 7% for T2. Mean follow-up was 18. 4 months.
Case series	There were no deaths or perforations related to spray cryotherapy. Strictures developed in 12 of 88 patients (13. 6%) but were present before spray cryotherapy in 3 of 12.
Case series	This study suggests that endoscopic spray cryotherapy is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment option for early esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Cross-sectional study	Background: The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.
Cross-sectional study	Objectives: This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among US adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).
Cross-sectional study	Methods: The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9 623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce US population estimates.
Cross-sectional study	Results: According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among US adults was 45. 6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43. 6% to 47. 6%) and 31. 9% (95% CI: 30. 1% to 33.
Cross-sectional study	7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36. 2% (95% CI: 34. 2% to 38. 2%) and 34. 3% (95% CI: 32. 5% to 36. 2%) of US adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.
Cross-sectional study	4% of US adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among US adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53. 4% (95% CI: 49. 9% to 56. 8%) and 39. 0% (95% CI: 36. 4% to 41.
Cross-sectional study	6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of US adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.
Cross-sectional study	Potential US Population Impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guideline
Cross-sectional study	The aim of this study is to describe trends in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension; mean blood pressure; and the classification of blood pressure among US adults 2003 to 2012.
Cross-sectional study	Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2012, a total of 9255 adult participants aged ≥18 years were identified as having hypertension, defined as measured blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or taking prescription medication for hypertension.
Cross-sectional study	Awareness and treatment among hypertensive adults were ascertained via an interviewer administered questionnaire.
Cross-sectional study	Controlled hypertension among hypertensive adults was defined as systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg.
Cross-sectional study	Blood pressure was categorized as optimal blood pressure, prehypertension, and stage I and stage II hypertension. Between 2003 and 2012, the percentage of adults with controlled hypertension increased (P-trend <0. 01).
Cross-sectional study	Hypertensive adults with optimal blood pressure and with prehypertension increased from 13% to 19% and 27% to 33%, respectively (P-trend <0. 01 for both groups).
Cross-sectional study	Among hypertensive adults who were taking antihypertensive medication, uncontrolled hypertension decreased from 38% to 30% (P-trend <0. 01). Similarly, a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure was observed (P-trend <0.
Cross-sectional study	01); however, mean diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged.
Cross-sectional study	The trend in the control of blood pressure has improved among hypertensive adults resulting in a higher percentage with blood pressure at the optimal or prehypertension level and a lower percentage in stage I and stage II hypertension.
Cross-sectional study	Overall, mean systolic blood pressure decreased as did the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension among the treated hypertensive population.
Cross-sectional study	Trends in blood pressure among adults with hypertension: United States, 2003 to 2012
meta analysis	Background: The age-specific relevance of blood pressure to cause-specific mortality is best assessed by collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from the separate prospective studies.
meta analysis	Methods: Information was obtained on each of one million adults with no previous vascular disease recorded at baseline in 61 prospective observational studies of blood pressure and mortality. During 12.
meta analysis	7 million person-years at risk, there were about 56000 vascular deaths (12000 stroke, 34000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 10000 other vascular) and 66000 other deaths at ages 40-89 years.
meta analysis	Meta-analyses, involving "time-dependent" correction for regression dilution, related mortality during each decade of age at death to the estimated usual blood pressure at the start of that decade.
meta analysis	Findings: Within each decade of age at death, the proportional difference in the risk of vascular death associated with a given absolute difference in usual blood pressure is about the same down to at least 115 mm Hg usual systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 75 mm Hg usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP), below which there is little evidence.
meta analysis	At ages 40-69 years, each difference of 20 mm Hg usual SBP (or, approximately equivalently, 10 mm Hg usual DBP) is associated with more than a twofold difference in the stroke death rate, and with twofold differences in the death rates from IHD and from other vascular causes.
meta analysis	All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality are about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at ages 40-49 years, but the annual absolute differences in risk are greater in old age.
meta analysis	The age-specific associations are similar for men and women, and for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia.
meta analysis	For predicting vascular mortality from a single blood pressure measurement, the average of SBP and DBP is slightly more informative than either alone, and pulse pressure is much less informative.
meta analysis	Interpretation: Throughout middle and old age, usual blood pressure is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.

review	The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans.
review	In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach.
review	Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation.
review	Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting.
review	Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated.
review	Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk.
review	In addition, high nighttime BP on ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Both oscillometric and auscultatory methods are considered acceptable for measuring BP in children and adolescents.
review	Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for obtaining accurate BP measurements.
review	Measurement of Blood Pressure in Humans: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
meta analysis	Importance: Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement involves recording several blood pressure (BP) readings using a fully automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer with the patient resting alone in a quiet place.
meta analysis	Although several studies have shown AOBP measurement to be more accurate than routine office BP measurement and not subject to a "white coat effect," the cumulative evidence has not yet been systematically reviewed.
meta analysis	Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between AOBP and office BP readings measured in routine clinical practice and in research studies, and ambulatory BP recorded during awake hours, as the latter is a standard for predicting future cardiovascular events.
meta analysis	Data sources: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from 2003 to April 25, 2018.
meta analysis	Study selection: Studies on systolic and diastolic BP measurement by AOBP in comparison with awake ambulatory BP, routine office BP, and research BP measurements were included if they contained 30 patients or more.
meta analysis	Data extraction and synthesis: Study characteristics were abstracted independently and random effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted.
meta analysis	Main outcomes and measures: Pooled mean differences (95% CI) of systolic and diastolic BP between types of BP measurement. Results: Data were compiled from 31 articles comprising 9279 participants (4736 men and 4543 women).
meta analysis	In samples with systolic AOBP of 130 mm Hg or more, routine office and research systolic BP readings were substantially higher than AOBP readings, with a pooled mean difference of 14. 5 mm Hg (95% CI, 11. 8-17. 2 mm Hg; n = 9; I2 = 94. 3%; P <.
meta analysis	001) for routine office systolic BP readings and 7. 0 mm Hg (95% CI, 4. 9-9. 1 mm Hg; n = 9; I2 = 85. 7%; P <. 001) for research systolic BP readings. Systolic awake ambulatory BP and AOBP readings were similar, with a pooled mean difference of 0.
meta analysis	3 mm Hg (95% CI, -1. 1 to 1. 7 mm Hg; n = 19; I2 = 90%; P <. 001).
meta analysis	Conclusions and relevance: Automated office blood pressure readings, only when recorded properly with the patient sitting alone in a quiet place, are more accurate than office BP readings in routine clinical practice and are similar to awake ambulatory BP readings, with mean AOBP being devoid of any white coat effect.
meta analysis	There has been some reluctance among physicians to adopt this technique because of uncertainty about its advantages compared with more traditional methods of recording BP during an office visit.
meta analysis	Based on the evidence, AOBP should now be the preferred method for recording BP in routine clinical practice.
meta analysis	Comparing Automated Office Blood Pressure Readings With Other Methods of Blood Pressure Measurement for Identifying Patients With Possible Hypertension: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Cohort study	Objective: To validate an algorithm for the interpretation of automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement based upon data from untreated patients referred by physicians in the community for 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).
Cohort study	Methods: An algorithm for interpreting AOBP readings was developed taking into account the previously documented equivalence of AOBP and mean awake ambulatory BP (ABP; mmHg), which were each classified as optimum BP (<130/80), borderline BP (130-139/80-89) and hypertension (>or=140/90).
Cohort study	This classification was applied to data derived from 254 untreated patients undergoing 24-h ABPM, AOBP and routine manual BP taken at the patient's own family physician's office. Results: The mean awake ABP (135. 3 +/- 12. 4/81. 0 +/- 10.
Cohort study	2) was similar to the mean AOBP (132. 6 +/- 17. 4/80. 0 +/- 11. 1) with both values being significantly (P < 0. 001) lower than the routine manual BP (149. 7 +/- 15. 2/89. 3 +/- 9. 5).
Cohort study	Of the 69 patients with a systolic AOBP at least 140, only five (7. 3%) exhibited white-coat hypertension with a normal mean awake ambulatory systolic BP less than 130.
Cohort study	Similarly, of the 47 patients with a diastolic AOBP at least 90, none had optimum BP (diastolic BP < 80 mmHg on ABPM). White-coat hypertension was significantly (P = 0. 005/P = 0. 006) more prevalent for systolic/diastolic BP (22. 1%/13.
Cohort study	4%) when routine, manual BP readings were analysed. Conclusion: In contrast to routine manual office BP, a diagnosis of hypertension by AOBP is unlikely to be associated with an optimum awake ABP.
Cohort study	A proposed algorithm for diagnosing hypertension using automated office blood pressure measurement
review	The diagnosis and management of hypertension, a common cardiovascular risk factor among the general population, have been based primarily on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office.
review	BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting, and higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP.
review	Self-measured BP monitoring, the measurement of BP by an individual outside of the office at home, is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement.
review	Several national and international hypertension guidelines endorse self-measured BP monitoring.
review	Indications include the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension.
review	Other indications include confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension and detecting morning hypertension.
review	Validated self-measured BP monitoring devices that use the oscillometric method are preferred, and a standardized BP measurement and monitoring protocol should be followed.
review	Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials indicates that self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when done along with cointerventions.
review	The addition of self-measured BP monitoring to office BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring alone or usual care among individuals with high office BP.
review	The use of self-measured BP monitoring is commonly reported by both individuals and providers. Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring has high potential for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States.
review	Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of self-measured BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes are needed.
review	To adequately address barriers to the implementation of self-measured BP monitoring, financial investment is needed in the following areas: improving education and training of individuals and providers, building health information technology capacity, incorporating self-measured BP readings into clinical performance measures, supporting cointerventions, and enhancing reimbursement.
review	Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring at Home: A Joint Policy Statement From the American Heart Association and American Medical Association
review	Importance: Office blood pressure (BP) measurements are not the most accurate method to diagnose hypertension.
review	Home BP monitoring (HBPM) and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) are out-of-office alternatives, and ABPM is considered the reference standard for BP assessment.
review	Objective: To systematically review the accuracy of oscillometric office and home BP measurement methods for correctly classifying adults as having hypertension, defined using ABPM. Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrials.
review	gov, and DARE databases and the American Heart Association website (from inception to April 2021) were searched, along with reference lists from retrieved articles.
review	Data extraction and synthesis: Two authors independently abstracted raw data and assessed methodological quality. A third author resolved disputes as needed.
review	Main outcomes and measures: Random effects summary sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for BP measurement methods for the diagnosis of hypertension.
review	ABPM (24-hour mean BP ≥130/80 mm Hg or mean BP while awake ≥135/85 mm Hg) was considered the reference standard.
review	Results: A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (n = 6877) that compared conventional oscillometric office BP measurements to mean BP during 24-hour ABPM and 6 studies (n = 2049) that compared mean BP on HBPM to mean BP during 24-hour ABPM were included (range, 117-2209 participants per analysis); 2 of these studies (n = 3040) used consecutive samples.
review	The overall prevalence of hypertension identified by 24-hour ABPM was 49% (95% CI, 39%-60%) in the pooled studies that evaluated office measures and 54% (95% CI, 39%-69%) in studies that evaluated HBPM.
review	All included studies assessed sensitivity and specificity at the office BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg and the home BP threshold of 135/85 mm Hg.
review	Conventional office oscillometric measurement (1-5 measurements in a single visit with BP ≥140/90 mm Hg) had a sensitivity of 51% (95% CI, 36%-67%), specificity of 88% (95% CI, 80%-96%), positive LR of 4. 2 (95% CI, 2. 5-6. 0), and negative LR of 0.
review	56 (95% CI, 0. 42-0. 69). Mean BP with HBPM (with BP ≥135/85 mm Hg) had a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 65%-86%), specificity of 76% (95% CI, 65%-86%), positive LR of 3. 1 (95% CI, 2. 2-4. 0), and negative LR of 0. 33 (95% CI, 0. 20-0. 47).
review	Two studies (1 with a consecutive sample) that compared unattended automated mean office BP (with BP ≥135/85 mm Hg) with 24-hour ABPM had sensitivity ranging from 48% to 51% and specificity ranging from 80% to 91%.
review	One study that compared attended automated mean office BP (with BP ≥140/90 mm Hg) with 24-hour ABPM had a sensitivity of 87. 6% (95% CI, 83%-92%) and specificity of 24. 1% (95% CI, 16%-32%).
review	Conclusions and relevance: Office measurements of BP may not be accurate enough to rule in or rule out hypertension; HBPM may be helpful to confirm a diagnosis.
review	When there is uncertainty around threshold values or when office and HBPM are not in agreement, 24-hour ABPM should be considered to establish the diagnosis.
review	Does This Adult Patient Have Hypertension?: The Rational Clinical Examination Systematic Review
Cohort study	Context: Hypertension is an important preventable risk factor for death among women. While several modifiable risk factors have been identified, their combined risk and distribution in the population have not been assessed.
Cohort study	Objective: To estimate the hypothetical fraction of hypertension incidence associated with dietary and lifestyle factors in women.
Cohort study	Design, setting, and participants: Prospective cohort study of 83,882 adult women aged 27 to 44 years in the second Nurses' Health Study who did not have hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer in 1991, and who had normal reported blood pressure (defined as systolic blood pressure of < or = 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of < or = 80 mm Hg), with follow-up for incident hypertension for 14 years through 2005.
Cohort study	Six modifiable lifestyle and dietary factors for hypertension were identified.
Cohort study	The 6 low-risk factors for hypertension were a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25, a daily mean of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise, a high score on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet based on responses to a food frequency questionnaire, modest alcohol intake up to 10 g/d, use of nonnarcotic analgesics less than once per week, and intake of 400 microg/d or more of supplemental folic acid.
Cohort study	The association between combinations of 3 (normal BMI, daily vigorous exercise, and DASH-style diet), 4 (3 low-risk factors plus modest alcohol intake), 5 (4 low-risk factors plus avoidance of nonnarcotic analgesics), and 6 (folic acid supplementation > or = 400 microg/d) low-risk factors and the risk of developing hypertension was analyzed.
Cohort study	Main outcome measures: Adjusted hazard ratios for incident self-reported hypertension and population attributable risks (PARs). Results: A total of 12,319 incident cases of hypertension were reported.
Cohort study	All 6 modifiable risk factors were independently associated with the risk of developing hypertension during follow-up after also adjusting for age, race, family history of hypertension, smoking status, and use of oral contraceptives.
Cohort study	For women who had all 6 low-risk factors (0. 3% of the population), the hazard ratio for incident hypertension was 0. 22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 10-0.
Cohort study	51); the hypothetical PAR was 78% (95% CI, 49%-90%) for women who lacked these low-risk factors. The corresponding hypothetical absolute incidence rate difference (ARD) was 8. 37 cases per 1000 person-years. The PARs were 72% (95% CI, 57%-82%; ARD, 7.
Cohort study	76 cases per 1000 person-years) for 5 low-risk factors (0. 8% of the population), 58% (95% CI, 46%-67%; ARD, 6. 28 cases per 1000 person-years) for 4 low-risk factors (1. 6% of the population), and 53% (95% CI, 45%-60%; ARD, 6.
Cohort study	02 cases per 1000 person-years) for 3 low-risk factors (3. 1% of the population).
Cohort study	Body mass index alone was the most powerful predictor of hypertension, with a BMI of 25 or greater having an adjusted PAR of 40% (95% CI, 38%-41%) compared with a BMI of less than 25.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Adherence to low-risk dietary and lifestyle factors was associated with a significantly lower incidence of self-reported hypertension.
Cohort study	Adopting low-risk dietary and lifestyle factors has the potential to prevent a large proportion of new-onset hypertension occurring among young women.
Cohort study	Diet and lifestyle risk factors associated with incident hypertension in women
Cohort study	Objective: To assess the relations among prevalence of arterial hypertension, history of weight change, and current body weight in the range from normal weight to severe obesity.
Cohort study	Design: Retrospective analysis of medical records of men registered with Danish military authorities from 1943 to 1977 and followed up four to 40 years later.
Cohort study	Setting: Draft board of Copenhagen and surrounding counties and the rest of Sjaelland and surrounding islands.
Cohort study	Subjects: 964 Men who were severely obese (body mass index greater than or equal to kg/m2 at the first examination) and 1134 random controls. Main outcome measures: Blood pressure and weight.
Cohort study	Results: Hypertension was more prevalent in subjects with an unchanged body mass index as that index increased over the range studied.
Cohort study	At any body mass index hypertension was more prevalent in subjects who had increased to this index and less common in those who had decreased to it than in those who had stayed the same weight since the first examination.
Cohort study	Hypertension among controls was most common in those subjects who had become obese during adulthood.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Changes in body weight have a great influence on arterial hypertension independent of the effect of attained weight, particularly in obese subjects.
Cohort study	Independent effects of weight change and attained body weight on prevalence of arterial hypertension in obese and non-obese men
review	Hypertension is a frequent, chronic, age-related disorder, which often entails debilitating cardiovascular and renal complications. Blood pressure is usually noted in combination with other cardiovascular risk factors.
review	Diagnosis of hypertension increasingly relies on automated techniques of blood pressure measurement.
review	The pathophysiology of essential hypertension depends on the primary or secondary inability of the kidney to excrete sodium at a normal blood pressure.
review	The central nervous system, endocrine factors, the large arteries, and the microcirculation also have roles in the disorder.
review	Although monogenic forms of blood pressure dysregulation exist, hypertension mostly arises as a complex quantitative trait that is affected by varying combinations of genetic and environmental factors.
review	Non-pharmacological strategies can reduce blood pressure. Antihypertensive drug treatment diminishes the complications of hypertension.
review	The concept that a few major genes will provide the final clue to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension is an oversimplification that contradicts the heterogeneous nature of this disorder.
review	Further integration of genetic, molecular, clinical, and epidemiological research could disclose subsets of patients in whom specific combinations of genetic and environmental factors raise blood pressure, and might lead to more individualised treatment.
review	Essential hypertension
Cohort study	Background: Parental hypertension is used to classify hypertension risk in young adults, but the long-term association of parental hypertension with blood pressure (BP) change and risk of hypertension over the adult life span has not been well studied.
Cohort study	Methods: We examined the association of parental hypertension with BP change and hypertension risk from young adulthood through the ninth decade of life in a longitudinal cohort of 1160 male former medical students with 54 years of follow-up.
Cohort study	Results: In mixed-effects models using 29 867 BP measurements, mean systolic and diastolic BP readings were significantly higher at baseline among participants with parental hypertension.
Cohort study	The rate of annual increase was slightly higher for systolic (0. 03 mm Hg, P=. 04), but not diastolic, BP in those with parental hypertension.
Cohort study	After adjustment for baseline systolic and diastolic BP and time-dependent covariates--body mass index, alcohol consumption, coffee drinking, physical activity, and cigarette smoking--the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of hypertension development was 1.
Cohort study	5 (1. 2-2. 0) for men with maternal hypertension only, 1. 8 (1. 4-2. 4) for men with paternal hypertension only, and 2. 4 (1. 8-3. 2) for men with hypertension in both parents compared with men whose parents never developed hypertension.
Cohort study	Early-onset (at age <or=55 years) hypertension in both parents imparted a 6. 2-fold higher adjusted risk (95% CI, 3. 6-10. 7) for the development of hypertension throughout adult life and a 20. 0-fold higher adjusted risk (95% CI, 8. 4-47.
Cohort study	9) at the age of 35 years. Conclusion: Hypertension in both mothers and fathers has a strong independent association with elevated BP levels and incident hypertension over the course of adult life.

Cohort study	Fitness and physical activity are each inversely associated with the development of hypertension. We tested whether fitness and physical activity were independently associated with the 20-year incidence of hypertension in 4618 men and women.
Cohort study	Hypertension was determined in participants who had systolic blood pressure >or=140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >or=90 mm Hg or who reported antihypertensive medication use.
Cohort study	Fitness was estimated based on the duration of a symptom-limited graded exercise treadmill test, and physical activity was self-reported. The incidence rate of hypertension was 13. 8 per 1000 person-years (n=1022).
Cohort study	Both baseline fitness (hazard ratio: 0. 63 [95% CI: 0. 56 to 0. 70 per SD]; 2. 9 minutes) and physical activity (hazard ratio: 0. 86 [95% CI: 0. 79 to 0.
Cohort study	84 per SD]; 297 exercise units) were inversely associated with incident hypertension when included jointly in a model that also adjusted for age, sex, race, baseline smoking status, systolic blood pressure, alcohol intake, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, dietary fiber, dietary sodium, fasting glucose, and body mass index.
Cohort study	The magnitude of association between physical activity and hypertension was strongest among participants in the high fitness (hazard ratio: 0. 80 [95% CI: 0. 68 to 0.
Cohort study	94]) category, whereas the magnitude of association between fitness and hypertension was similar across tertiles of physical activity.
Cohort study	The estimated proportion of hypertension cases that could be prevented if participants moved to a higher fitness category (ie, preventive fraction) was 34% and varied by race and sex group.
Cohort study	Fitness and physical activity are each associated with incident hypertension, and low fitness may account for a substantial proportion of hypertension incidence.

meta analysis	Insomnia disorder with objective short sleep duration (less than 6 h of objective sleep or sleep efficiency less than 85%) has been considered as a biologically severe subtype of insomnia associated with a higher risk of cardiometabolic disease morbidity.
meta analysis	This systematic review and meta-analysis firstly compared insomnia disorder with objective short and normal sleep duration, and subsequently, objective short sleep duration with and without insomnia disorder, and their associations with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and body mass index.
meta analysis	A systematic search of five databases yielded 2345 non-duplicated articles, of which 11 individual studies were used for the qualitative review and 10 individual studies for the meta-analysis. The sample size varied from 30 to 4994 participants.
meta analysis	A higher risk of hypertension (RR 1. 54, 95% CI: [1. 30; 1. 82] p < 0. 0001) and type 2 diabetes (RR 1. 63 [1. 37; 1. 94], p < 0.
meta analysis	0001) was associated with insomnia disorder with objective short sleep compared to normal sleep duration, but not for body mass index.
meta analysis	Comparisons between insomnia disorder with objective short sleep and objective short sleep without insomnia disorder showed no significant differences.
meta analysis	However, the majority of these studies were cross-sectional, and there is a need for more cohort study data.
meta analysis	The association of insomnia disorder characterised by objective short sleep duration with hypertension, diabetes and body mass index: A systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	To deeply investigate the correlation between sleep duration and hypertension. The electronic databases Cochrane Library, Pubmed and Embase updated to December 2017 were retrieved, and manual searching for paper-based documents was also performed.
meta analysis	After studies were selected according to the predefined screening criteria, their qualities were assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Based on R 3.
meta analysis	43 software, the association between sleep duration and hypertension was analyzed by dose-response meta-analysis, using relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) as effect indexes.
meta analysis	Furthermore, publication bias of the eligible studies was evaluated using Egger's test. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted through ignoring one study per time and then observing its influences on the pooled results.
meta analysis	A total of 9 studies (involving 48525 objects) were included in this dose-response meta-analysis, which had high qualities. The differences in ≤5 h vs. 7 h, 6 h vs. 7 h, and 9 h vs.
meta analysis	7 h groups had statistical significances, suggesting that hypertension risk was higher for shorter sleep duration (P < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in >9 h vs. 7 h group.
meta analysis	No publication bias was found for the eligible studies, indicating that our results were highly credible (t = 0. 030, P = 0. 9766). However, the pooled results were reversed after ignoring each included study per time.
meta analysis	Dose-response meta-analysis showed that the hypertension risk reduced for 0. 3207% when the sleep duration increased by 1 h. Shorter sleep duration contributes to the increase of hypertension risk.

randomized controlled trial	While limited evidence suggests that longer sleep durations can improve metabolic health in habitual short sleepers, there is no consensus on how sustained sleep extension can be achieved.
randomized controlled trial	A total of 18 men (mean [SD] age 41 [ 9] years), who were overweight/obese (mean [SD] body mass index 30 [3] kg/m2 ) and short sleepers at increased risk of type 2 diabetes were randomised to a 6-week sleep-extension programme based on cognitive behavioural principles (n = 10) or a control (n = 8) group.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome was 6-week change in actigraphic total sleep time (TST).
randomized controlled trial	Fasting plasma insulin, insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]), blood pressure, appetite-related hormones from a mixed-meal tolerance test, and continuous glucose levels were also measured.
randomized controlled trial	Baseline to 6-week change in TST was greater in the sleep-extension group, at 79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 68. 90, 88. 05) versus 6 (95% CI -4. 43, 16. 99) min.
randomized controlled trial	Change in the sleep-extension and control groups respectively also showed: lower fasting insulin (-11. 03 [95% CI -22. 70, 0. 65] versus 7. 07 [95% CI -4. 60, 18. 74] pmol/L); lower systolic (-11. 09 [95% CI -17. 49, -4. 69] versus 0. 76 [95% CI -5.

Before and after control trial	Objectives: Sleep is a major lifestyle factor that may change dramatically when students begin college. Sleep duration has been shown to influence cardiometabolic health.
Before and after control trial	We investigated the feasibility of sleep extension in college students to increase actigraphically measured sleep duration and the association of sleep extension with daytime sleepiness and blood pressure.
Before and after control trial	Design: This was a within-participant experimental study. Setting: The study setting was 14-day at-home study and 3 in-lab visits. Participants: The participants included in this study were healthy undergraduate students (n=53; mean age 20. 5 ± 1.
Before and after control trial	1 years; 70% female). Intervention: Participants maintained a habitual sleep schedule during week 1 and then were instructed to extend their sleep duration by at least 1 hour per night for week 2.
Before and after control trial	Measurements: Sleep measures included wrist actigraphy and daytime sleepiness assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and by daily diary. Cardiovascular measures included blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).
Before and after control trial	ESS, BP and HR were measured during lab visits on days 7 and 14. Multilevel modeling was used to test the effects of extension on sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, BP and HR. Results: Participants increased sleep duration during week 2 by 43. 0 ± 6.
Before and after control trial	2 standard error minutes per night, compared with week 1 (p<. 001). Furthermore, 41 of 53 participants (77%) increased their sleep duration by >15 minutes per night (p<. 001). Participants reported less daytime sleepiness on weekly ESS (p<.
Before and after control trial	05) and daily log ratings (p<. 001) after sleep extension; and systolic BP was significantly reduced by 7. 0 ± 3. 0 mmHg (p<. 05).
Before and after control trial	Conclusion: This study demonstrates that substantive sleep extension is feasible in college students and can positively impact their sleep and cardiovascular health.

review	Methods: A total of 20 studies (with 48,545 participants) published between January 1960 and January 2000, identified through MEDLINE and other sources, related baseline electrocardiographic (ECG) or echocardiographic data on LVH to subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality.
review	Results: The prevalence of baseline LVH was higher in echocardiographic studies than in ECG studies (16%-74% vs 1%-44%, respectively). The adjusted risk of future cardiovascular morbidity associated with baseline LVH ranged from 1. 5 to 3.
review	5, with a weighted mean risk ratio of 2. 3 for all studies combined. The adjusted risk of all-cause mortality associated with baseline LVH ranged from 1. 5 to 8. 0, with a weighted mean risk ratio of 2. 5 for all studies combined.
review	There was a trend toward a worse prognosis among women with baseline LVH compared with men. These findings persisted in the various population and ethnic groups studied.
review	Conclusion: With the exception of one study in dialysis patients, LVH consistently predicted high risk, independently of examined covariates, with no clear difference in relation to race, presence or absence of hypertension or coronary disease, or between clinical and epidemiologic samples.
review	These results clarify the strong relation between LVH and adverse outcome and emphasize the clinical importance of its detection.
review	Prognostic implications of left ventricular hypertrophy
Cohort study	Objectives: - To study the relative and population-attributable risks of hypertension for the development of congestive heart failure (CHF), to assess the time course of progression from hypertension to CHF, and to identify risk factors that contribute to the development of overt heart failure in hypertensive subjects.
Cohort study	Design: - Inception cohort study. Setting: - General community. Participants: - Original Framingham Heart Study and Framingham Offspring Study participants aged 40 to 89 years and free of CHF.
Cohort study	To reflect more contemporary experience, the starting point of this study was January 1, 1970.
Cohort study	Exposure measures: - Hypertension (blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic or current use of medications for treatment of high blood pressure) and other potential CHF risk factors were assessed at periodic clinic examinations.
Cohort study	Outcome measure: - The development of CHF. Results: - A total of 5143 eligible subjects contributed 72422 person-years of observation. During up to 20. 1 years of follow-up (mean, 14.
Cohort study	1 years), there were 392 new cases of heart failure; in 91% (357/392), hypertension antedated the development of heart failure.
Cohort study	Adjusting for age and heart failure risk factors in proportional hazards regression models, the hazard for developing heart failure in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects was about 2-fold in men and 3-fold in women.
Cohort study	Multivariable analyses revealed that hypertension had a high population-attributable risk for CHF, accounting for 39% of cases in men and 59% in women.
Cohort study	Among hypertensive subjects, myocardial infarction, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and valvular heart disease were predictive of increased risk for CHF in both sexes.
Cohort study	Survival following the onset of hypertensive CHF was bleak; only 24% of men and 31% of women survived 5 years.
Cohort study	Conclusions: - Hypertension was the most common risk factor for CHF, and it contributed a large proportion of heart failure cases in this population-based sample.
Cohort study	Preventive strategies directed toward earlier and more aggressive blood pressure control are likely to offer the greatest promise for reducing the incidence of CHF and its associated mortality.
Cohort study	The progression from hypertension to congestive heart failure
Cohort study	Background: The relationship between outpatient systolic and diastolic blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear and has been complicated by recently revised guidelines with two different thresholds (≥140/90 mm Hg and ≥130/80 mm Hg) for treating hypertension.
Cohort study	Methods: Using data from 1.
Cohort study	3 million adults in a general outpatient population, we performed a multivariable Cox survival analysis to determine the effect of the burden of systolic and diastolic hypertension on a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke over a period of 8 years.
Cohort study	The analysis controlled for demographic characteristics and coexisting conditions. Results: The burdens of systolic and diastolic hypertension each independently predicted adverse outcomes.
Cohort study	In survival models, a continuous burden of systolic hypertension (≥140 mm Hg; hazard ratio per unit increase in z score, 1. 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 17 to 1.
Cohort study	18) and diastolic hypertension (≥90 mm Hg; hazard ratio per unit increase in z score, 1. 06; 95% CI, 1. 06 to 1. 07) independently predicted the composite outcome.
Cohort study	Similar results were observed with the lower threshold of hypertension (≥130/80 mm Hg) and with systolic and diastolic blood pressures used as predictors without hypertension thresholds.
Cohort study	A J-curve relation between diastolic blood pressure and outcomes was seen that was explained at least in part by age and other covariates and by a higher effect of systolic hypertension among persons in the lowest quartile of diastolic blood pressure.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Although systolic blood-pressure elevation had a greater effect on outcomes, both systolic and diastolic hypertension independently influenced the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, regardless of the definition of hypertension (≥140/90 mm Hg or ≥130/80 mm Hg).

Cohort study	Effect of Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure on Cardiovascular Outcomes
randomized controlled trial	Background: Isolated systolic hypertension occurs in about 15% of people aged 60 years or older.
randomized controlled trial	In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether active treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke combined was the primary endpoint.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: All patients (> 60 years) were initially started on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their average sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg.
randomized controlled trial	After stratification for centre, sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5-25.
randomized controlled trial	0 mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing from double-blind treatment were still followed up. We compared occurrence of major endpoints by intention to treat.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: At a median of 2 years' follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n = 2398).
randomized controlled trial	The between-group differences were systolic 10. 1 mm Hg (95% CI 8. 8-11. 4) and diastolic, 4. 5 mm Hg (3. 9-5. 1). Active treatment reduced the total rate of stroke from 13. 7 to 7. 9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years (42% reduction; p = 0. 003).
randomized controlled trial	Non-fatal stroke decreased by 44% (p = 0. 007). In the active treatment group, all fatal and non-fatal cardiac endpoints, including sudden death, declined by 26% (p = 0. 03). Non-fatal cardiac endpoints decreased by 33% (p = 0.
randomized controlled trial	03) and all fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular endpoints by 31% (p < 0. 001). Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower on active treatment (-27%, p = 0. 07), but all-cause mortality was not influenced (-14%; p = 0. 22).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Among elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment starting with nitrendipine reduces the rate of cardiovascular complications.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years with this type of regimen may prevent 29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular endpoints.

Case-control study	Background and purpose: Given that hypertension is now relatively well controlled and use of antiplatelet agents has increased, our primary aims were to investigate the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with hypertension and use of antiplatelet agents.
Case-control study	Methods: In this city-wide case-control study, 370 consecutive cases of primary ICH, verified by CT or autopsy, were identified from one of 13 Melbourne hospitals.
Case-control study	Ten subjects (or their next of kin) could not be located and 29 refused to participate, resulting in 331 eventual cases. Patients were aged between 18 and 80 years and had no prior stroke.
Case-control study	Population-based control subjects were individually age- (+/- 5 years), sex-, and geographically matched to subject cases.
Case-control study	A questionnaire administered to participants (or next of kin) elicited information about prior exposure to various potential risk factors. Results: Hypertension approximately doubled the risk of ICH (odds ratio, 2. 55; 95% confidence interval, 1.
Case-control study	72 to 3. 79). The use of aspirinlike drugs, in doses used for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or cardiac disease, was not associated with an increased risk of ICH (odds ratio, 0. 66; 95% confidence interval, 0. 20 to 2. 21).
Case-control study	Factors associated with a reduced risk of ICH were a history of cardiovascular disease, arthritis, or high cholesterol level; being moderately overweight or using hormone replacement therapy; and drinking coffee.
Case-control study	Conclusions: Hypertension was the most important risk factor for ICH but not as high as previously reported, nor was it higher than that reported for ischemic stroke.
Case-control study	There was no evidence for any association between the use of aspirinlike drugs and ICH.

review	Long-standing risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) have typically included age, blood levels of total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, cigarette use, diabetes mellitus, and left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography.
review	Each of the traditional risk-factor measures has expanded in scope over time; for instance, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels are each associated with the occurrence of CAD, and an individual need not be hypertensive to be at an increased risk.
review	Although total (or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and HDL cholesterol are highly associated with CAD incidence, other newer lipid measures such as apolipoproteins A-I and B, and genetic markers have shown little or no additional effect in predicting CAD.
review	Diabetes mellitus has been consistently associated with CAD but less data are available to demonstrate independent roles for obesity and regional adiposity.
review	Although reports are more recent, hematologic factors such as fibrinogen concentration and leukocyte count have been consistently associated with CAD in observational studies.
review	Prediction equations continue to emphasize the traditional biological factors and not behaviors.
review	Among life-style habits such as diet, sedentary activity, and cigarette smoking, only the latter has been consistently used in CAD prediction because of its independent effect.
review	Established risk factors and coronary artery disease: the Framingham Study
Cross-sectional study	Background: The prevalence and incidence of end-stage renal disease in the United States are increasing, but milder renal disease is much more common and may often go undiagnosed and undertreated.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: A cross-sectional study of a representative sample of the US population was conducted using 16 589 adult participants aged 17 years and older in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) conducted from 1988 to 1994.
Cross-sectional study	An elevated serum creatinine level was defined as 141 micromol/L or higher (>/=1. 6 mg/dL) for men and 124 micromol/L or higher (>/=1. 4 mg/dL) for women (>99th percentile for healthy young adults) and was the main outcome measure.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, presence of hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, older age, and diabetes mellitus were all associated with higher serum creatinine levels. An estimated 3. 0% (5.
Cross-sectional study	6 million) of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population had elevated serum creatinine levels, 70% of whom were hypertensive. Among hypertensive individuals with an elevated serum creatinine level, 75% received treatment.
Cross-sectional study	However, only 11% of all individuals with hypertension had their blood pressure reduced to lower than 130/85 mm Hg (the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommendation for hypertensive individuals with renal disease); 27% had a blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg.
Cross-sectional study	Treated hypertensive individuals with an elevated creatinine level had a mean blood pressure of 147/77 mm Hg, 48% of whom were prescribed one antihypertensive medication.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusion: Elevated serum creatinine level, an indicator of chronic renal disease, is common and strongly related to inadequate treatment of high blood pressure.
Cross-sectional study	Prevalence of high blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine level in the United States: findings from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994)
Cohort study	Background: Many cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are ascribed to hypertension.
Cohort study	However, because renal disease itself can raise blood pressure, some investigators argue that ESRD seen in patients with hypertension is due to underlying primary renal disease.
Cohort study	Previous cohort studies of the relationship between blood pressure and ESRD did not uniformly screen out baseline kidney disease.
Cohort study	Methods: We conducted a historical cohort study among members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system. The ESRD cases were ascertained by matching with the US Renal Data System registry.
Cohort study	Results: A total of 316 675 adult Kaiser members participated in the Multiphasic Health Checkups from 1964 to 1985. All subjects had estimated glomerular filtration rates of 60 mL /min per 1.
Cohort study	73 m(2) or higher and negative dipstick urinalysis results for proteinuria or hematuria. During 8 210 431 person-years of follow-up, 1149 cases of ESRD occurred.
Cohort study	Compared with subjects with a blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg, the adjusted relative risks for developing ESRD were 1. 62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 27-2. 07) for blood pressures of 120 to 129/80 to 84 mm Hg, 1. 98 (95% CI, 1. 55-2.
Cohort study	52) for blood pressures of 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg, 2. 59 (95% CI, 2. 07-3. 25) for blood pressures of 140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg, 3. 86 (95% CI, 3. 00-4. 96) for blood pressures of 160 to 179/100 to 109 mm Hg, 3. 88 (95% CI, 2. 82-5.
Cohort study	34) for blood pressures of 180 to 209/110 to 119 mm Hg, and 4. 25 (95% CI, 2. 63-6. 86) for blood pressures of 210/120 mm Hg or higher. Similar associations between blood pressure level and ESRD risk were seen in all subgroup analyses.
Cohort study	Conclusions: Even relatively modest elevation in blood pressure is an independent risk factor for ESRD. The observed relationship does not appear to be due to confounding by clinically evident baseline kidney disease.
Cohort study	Elevated blood pressure and risk of end-stage renal disease in subjects without baseline kidney disease
Cohort study	Background: We examined the relative importance of diastolic (DBP), systolic (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) as predictors of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in different age groups of Framingham Heart Study participants.
Cohort study	Methods and results: We studied 3060 men and 3479 women between 20 and 79 years of age who were free of CHD and were not on antihypertensive drug therapy at baseline.
Cohort study	Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other risk factors was used to assess the relations of BP indexes to CHD risk over a 20-year follow-up.
Cohort study	In the group <50 years of age, DBP was the strongest predictor of CHD risk (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 mm Hg increment, 1. 34; 95% CI, 1. 18 to 1. 51) rather than SBP (HR, 1. 14; 95% CI, 1. 06 to 1. 24) or PP (HR, 1. 02; 95% CI, 0. 89 to 1. 17).
Cohort study	In the group 50 to 59 years of age, risks were comparable for all 3 BP indexes. In the older age group, the strongest predictor of CHD risk was PP (HR, 1. 24; 95% CI, 1. 16 to 1. 33).
Cohort study	When both SBP and DBP were considered jointly, the former was directly and the latter was inversely related to CHD risk in the oldest age group Conclusions: With increasing age, there was a gradual shift from DBP to SBP and then to PP as predictors of CHD risk.
Cohort study	In patients <50 years of age, DBP was the strongest predictor.
Cohort study	Age 50 to 59 years was a transition period when all 3 BP indexes were comparable predictors, and from 60 years of age on, DBP was negatively related to CHD risk so that PP became superior to SBP.
Cohort study	Does the relation of blood pressure to coronary heart disease risk change with aging? The Framingham Heart Study
Cross-sectional study	Background: The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute currently defines a blood pressure under 120/80 as "normal.
Cross-sectional study	" Objective: To examine the independent effects of diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) on mortality and to estimate the number of Americans affected by accounting for these effects in the definition of "normal.
Cross-sectional study	" DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASURES: Data on adults (age 25-75) collected in the early 1970s in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were linked to vital status data through 1992 (N = 13,792) to model the relationship between blood pressure and mortality rate adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, BMI, cholesterol, education and income.
Cross-sectional study	To estimate the number of Americans in each blood pressure category, nationally representative data collected in the early 1960s (as a proxy for the underlying distribution of untreated blood pressure) were combined with 2008 population estimates from the US Census.
Cross-sectional study	Results: The mortality rate for individuals over age 50 began to increase in a stepwise fashion with increasing DBP levels of over 90. However, adjusting for SBP made the relationship disappear.
Cross-sectional study	For individuals over 50, the mortality rate began to significantly increase at a SBP ≥ 140 independent of DBP. In individuals ≤ 50 years of age, the situation was reversed; DBP was the more important predictor of mortality.
Cross-sectional study	Using these data to redefine a normal blood pressure as one that does not confer an increased mortality risk would reduce the number of American adults currently labeled as abnormal by about 100 million.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: DBP provides relatively little independent mortality risk information in adults over 50, but is an important predictor of mortality in younger adults. Conversely, SBP is more important in older adults than in younger adults.
Cross-sectional study	Accounting for these relationships in the definition of normal would avoid unnecessarily labeling millions of Americans as abnormal.
Cross-sectional study	Impact of diastolic and systolic blood pressure on mortality: implications for the definition of "normal"
Cross-sectional study	The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline defines hypertension as a blood pressure ≥130/80 mm Hg, whereas the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines use a ≥140/90 mm Hg threshold.
Cross-sectional study	Our objective was to study the associations between isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), diagnosed using these 2 blood pressure thresholds, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a large cohort of UK adults.
Cross-sectional study	We analyzed data from UK Biobank, which enrolled participants between 2006 and 2010 with follow-up through March 2019. We excluded persons with systolic hypertension or baseline CVD.
Cross-sectional study	We defined incident CVD as a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.
Cross-sectional study	We used Cox regression to quantify associations between IDH and CVD, as well as the individual outcomes included in the composite outcome. We studied 151 831 participants with normal systolic blood pressure (mean age 54 years, 40% male). Overall, 24.
Cross-sectional study	5% had IDH by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition compared with 6% by the ESC/NICE definition.
Cross-sectional study	Compared with normal diastolic blood pressure, IDH by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition was not significantly associated with CVD risk (hazard ratio, 1. 08 [95% CI, 0. 98-1.
Cross-sectional study	18]) whereas IDH by the ESC/NICE definition was significantly associated with a modest increase in CVD (hazard ratio, 1. 15 [95% CI, 1. 04-1. 29]). Similar results were found by sex and among participants not taking baseline antihypertensives.
Cross-sectional study	Furthermore, neither IDH definition was associated with the individual outcomes of nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke.
Cross-sectional study	In conclusion, the proportion of UK Biobank participants with IDH was significantly higher by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition compared with the ESC/NICE definitions; however, only the ESC/NICE definition was statistically associated with increased CVD risk.

review	In this review, we outline the rationale for targeting blood pressure and blood cholesterol lowering drug treatments to patients at high absolute cardiovascular risk, irrespective of their blood pressure or blood cholesterol levels.
review	Because the specific levels of blood pressure and cholesterol are of little clinical relevance when considered in isolation from other risk factors, terms such as hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia have limited value.
review	Separate management guidelines for raised blood pressure and blood cholesterol need to be replaced by integrated cardiovascular risk management guidelines, and absolute cardiovascular risk prediction scores should be used routinely.
review	Since cardiovascular risk factors interact with each other, moderate reductions in several risk factors can be more effective than major reductions in one.
review	An affordable daily pill combining low doses of various drugs could be useful for the many individuals with slightly abnormal cardiovascular risk factors.

review	Importance: Hypertension is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 45% of the adult US population and is the most commonly diagnosed condition at outpatient office visits.
review	Hypertension is a major contributing risk factor for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease.
review	Objective: To reaffirm its 2015 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in adults, the accuracy of office blood pressure measurement for initial screening, and the accuracy of various confirmatory blood pressure measurement methods.
review	Population: Adults 18 years or older without known hypertension. Evidence assessment: Using a reaffirmation deliberation process, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for hypertension in adults has substantial net benefit.
review	Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for hypertension in adults 18 years or older with office blood pressure measurement.
review	The USPSTF recommends obtaining blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment. (A recommendation).

review	Hypertension Canada provides annually updated, evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, assessment, prevention, and treatment of hypertension in adults and children. This year, the adult and pediatric guidelines are combined in one document.
review	The new 2018 pregnancy-specific hypertension guidelines are published separately.
review	For 2018, 5 new guidelines are introduced, and 1 existing guideline on the blood pressure thresholds and targets in the setting of thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is revised.
review	The use of validated wrist devices for the estimation of blood pressure in individuals with large arm circumference is now included.
review	Guidance is provided for the follow-up measurements of blood pressure, with the use of standardized methods and electronic (oscillometric) upper arm devices in individuals with hypertension, and either ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring in individuals with white coat effect.
review	We specify that all individuals with hypertension should have an assessment of global cardiovascular risk to promote health behaviours that lower blood pressure.
review	Finally, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor combination should be used in place of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in individuals with heart failure (with ejection fraction < 40%) who are symptomatic despite appropriate doses of guideline-directed heart failure therapies.
review	The specific evidence and rationale underlying each of these guidelines are discussed.

review	"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" provides a new guideline for hypertension prevention and management.
review	The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes.
review	Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated.
review	Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator.
review	Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.
review	The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: the JNC 7 report
review	Since the terms 'hypertension' and 'microalbuminuria' were first defined, data from numerous studies have documented the continuous, rather than dichotomous, relation between blood pressure, albumin excretion, and cardiovascular disease.
review	Lower blood pressures, down to at least 115/75 mmHg, and lower albumin excretions, below an estimated 2 mg/day, are associated with less cardiovascular risk.
review	We hypothesize that the abundances of modern civilization superimposed on the Paleolithic genotype of humans, which has not substantially changed in the last 10 000 years, have considerably shifted the 'normal' values for blood pressure and various biochemical indices such as albuminuria still found in today's stone-aged cultures to the 'neo-normal' values observed today in the rest of the modern world.
review	Defining a large portion of the population as 'normal' based upon these dichotomous 'neo-normal' standards is not supported by the data, and therefore seems unjustifiable.
review	We propose that the medical community consider abandoning the terms 'hypertension' and 'microalbuminuria' in favor of 'blood pressure-associated' and 'albuminuria-associated' disease.
review	'Hypertension' and 'microalbuminuria': the bell tolls for thee
Cohort study	Background: Decision about the management of hypertensive patients should not be based on the level of blood pressure alone, but also on the presence of other risk factors, target organ damage (TOD) and cardiovascular and renal disease.
Cohort study	Objective: To evaluate the impact of echocardiography and carotid ultrasonography in a more precise stratification of absolute cardiovascular risk.
Cohort study	Methods: Never-treated essential hypertensives (n = 141; 73 men, 68 women, mean age 46 +/- 11 years) referred for the first time to our out-patient clinic were included in the study.
Cohort study	They underwent the following procedures: (1) family and personal medical history, (2) clinical blood pressure (BP) measurement, (3) routine blood chemistry and urine analysis, (4) electrocardiogram, (5) echocardiogram, (6) carotid ultrasonogram.
Cohort study	Risk was stratified according to the criteria suggested by the 1999 WHO/ISH guidelines.
Cohort study	TOD was initially evaluated by routine procedures only, and subsequently reassessed by using data on cardiac and vascular structure obtained by ultrasound examinations (left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as left ventricular mass index (LVMI) > 134 g/m2 in men and > 110 g/m2 in women; carotid plaque as focal thickening > 1.
Cohort study	3 mm). Results: According to the first classification 20% were low-risk patients, 50% medium-risk, 22% high-risk and 8% very-high-risk patients.
Cohort study	A marked change in risk stratification was obtained when TOD was assessed by adding ultrasound examinations: low-risk patients 18%, medium-risk 28%, high-risk 45%, very-high-risk patients 9%.
Cohort study	Conclusions: The detection of TOD by ultrasound techniques allowed a much more accurate identification of high-risk patients, who represented a very large fraction (45%) of the patient population seen at our hypertension clinic.
Cohort study	In particular, a large proportion of patients classified as at moderate risk by routine investigations were instead found to be at high risk when ultrasound examinations were added.
Cohort study	The results of this study suggest that cardiovascular risk stratification only based on simple routine work-up can often underestimate overall risk, thus leading to a potentially inadequate therapeutic management especially of low-medium risk patients.

meta analysis	Objective: To determine the effects of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure, hormones, and lipids. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Data sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and reference list of relevant articles.
meta analysis	Inclusion criteria: Randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and duration of at least four weeks. Data extraction and analysis: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers.
meta analysis	Random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were performed. Results: Thirty four trials (3230 participants) were included.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt v usual salt) was -75 mmol/24 h (equivalent to a reduction of 4. 4 g/day salt), and with this reduction in salt intake, the mean change in blood pressure was -4.
meta analysis	18 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -5. 18 to -3. 18, I(2)=75%) for systolic blood pressure and -2. 06 mm Hg (-2. 67 to -1. 45, I(2)=68%) for diastolic blood pressure.
meta analysis	Meta-regression showed that age, ethnic group, blood pressure status (hypertensive or normotensive), and the change in 24 hour urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic blood pressure, explaining 68% of the variance between studies.
meta analysis	A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic blood pressure of 5. 8 mm Hg (2. 5 to 9. 2, P=0. 001) after adjustment for age, ethnic group, and blood pressure status.
meta analysis	For diastolic blood pressure, age, ethnic group, blood pressure status, and the change in 24 hour urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta-analysis by subgroup showed that in people with hypertension the mean effect was -5.
meta analysis	39 mm Hg (-6. 62 to -4. 15, I(2)=61%) for systolic blood pressure and -2. 82 mm Hg (-3. 54 to -2. 11, I(2)=52%) for diastolic blood pressure. In normotensive people, the figures were -2. 42 mm Hg (-3. 56 to -1. 29, I(2)=66%) and -1. 00 mm Hg (-1.
meta analysis	85 to -0. 15, I(2)=66%), respectively. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic blood pressure was significant in both white and black people and in men and women.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis of data on hormones and lipids showed that the mean change was 0. 26 ng/mL/h (0. 17 to 0. 36, I(2)=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73. 20 pmol/L (44. 92 to 101.
meta analysis	48, I(2)=62%) for aldosterone, 187 pmol/L (39 to 336, I(2)=5%) for noradrenaline (norepinephrine), 37 pmol/L (-1 to 74, I(2)=12%) for adrenaline (epinephrine), 0. 05 mmol/L (-0. 02 to 0. 11, I(2)=0%) for total cholesterol, 0. 05 mmol/L (-0. 01 to 0.
meta analysis	12, I(2)=0%) for low density lipoprotein cholesterol, -0. 02 mmol/L (-0. 06 to 0. 01, I(2)=16%) for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 0. 04 mmol/L (-0. 02 to 0. 09, I(2)=0%) for triglycerides.
meta analysis	Conclusions: A modest reduction in salt intake for four or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group.
meta analysis	Salt reduction is associated with a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and noradrenaline and no significant change in lipid concentrations.
meta analysis	These results support a reduction in population salt intake, which will lower population blood pressure and thereby reduce cardiovascular disease.
meta analysis	The observed significant association between the reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium and the fall in systolic blood pressure, indicates that larger reductions in salt intake will lead to larger falls in systolic blood pressure.
meta analysis	The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/day will have a major effect on blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3 g/day will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.
meta analysis	Effect of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials
review	A substantial body of evidence strongly supports the concept that multiple dietary factors affect blood pressure (BP).
review	Well-established dietary modifications that lower BP are reduced salt intake, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption (among those who drink).
review	Over the past decade, increased potassium intake and consumption of dietary patterns based on the "DASH diet" have emerged as effective strategies that also lower BP.
review	Of substantial public health relevance are findings related to blacks and older individuals. Specifically, blacks are especially sensitive to the BP-lowering effects of reduced salt intake, increased potassium intake, and the DASH diet.
review	Furthermore, it is well documented that older individuals, a group at high risk for BP-related cardiovascular and renal diseases, can make and sustain dietary changes.
review	The risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively throughout the range of BP, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg.
review	In view of the continuing epidemic of BP-related diseases and the increasing prevalence of hypertension, efforts to reduce BP in both nonhypertensive and hypertensive individuals are warranted.
review	In nonhypertensive individuals, dietary changes can lower BP and prevent hypertension.
review	In uncomplicated stage I hypertension (systolic BP of 140 to 159 mm Hg or diastolic BP of 90 to 99 mm Hg), dietary changes serve as initial treatment before drug therapy.
review	In those hypertensive patients already on drug therapy, lifestyle modifications, particularly a reduced salt intake, can further lower BP.
review	The current challenge to healthcare providers, researchers, government officials, and the general public is developing and implementing effective clinical and public health strategies that lead to sustained dietary changes among individuals and more broadly among whole populations.
review	Dietary approaches to prevent and treat hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association
randomized controlled trial	We investigated the relation between changes in the renin-aldosterone axis and reduction in blood pressure in 25 obese patients placed on a 12-week reducing diet; sodium intake was either medium (120 mmol) or low (40 mmol).
randomized controlled trial	Plasma renin activity (PRA) declined with weight loss, so that by 12 weeks there was a significant decrease in PRA (P less than 0. 01) as well as plasma aldosterone (P less than 0. 05), regardless of sodium intake.
randomized controlled trial	Weight loss with low sodium intake was equal to that with medium intake. The reduction in PRA but not in aldosterone correlated with weight loss in both sodium-intake groups (r = 0. 58).
randomized controlled trial	Mean arterial pressure fell significantly and equally in both groups, correlating with weight loss throughout the study (r = 0. 56) and with PRA from the fourth through 12th weeks (r = 0.
randomized controlled trial	48) These results demonstrate that weight loss is accompanied by reductions in PRA and aldosterone; PRA reductions, irrespective of sodium intake, may contribute to the decline in blood pressure.
randomized controlled trial	The effect of weight reduction on blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels in obese patients
randomized controlled trial	Context: Nonpharmacologic interventions are frequently recommended for treatment of hypertension in the elderly, but there is a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials in support of this recommendation.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To determine whether weight loss or reduced sodium intake is effective in the treatment of older persons with hypertension. Design: Randomized controlled trial.
randomized controlled trial	Participants: A total of 975 [corrected] men and women aged 60 to 80 years with systolic blood pressure lower than 145 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure lower than 85 mm Hg while receiving treatment with a single antihypertensive medication.
randomized controlled trial	Setting: Four academic health centers. Intervention: The 585 obese participants were randomized to reduced sodium intake, weight loss, both, or usual care, and the 390 nonobese participants were randomized to reduced sodium intake or usual care.
randomized controlled trial	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication was attempted after 3 months of intervention.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcome measure: Diagnosis of high blood pressure at 1 or more follow-up visits, or treatment with antihypertensive medication, or a cardiovascular event during follow-up (range, 15-36 months; median, 29 months).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The combined outcome measure was less frequent among those assigned vs not assigned to reduced sodium intake (relative hazard ratio, 0. 69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 59-0. 81; P<.
randomized controlled trial	001) and, in obese participants, among those assigned vs not assigned to weight loss (relative hazard ratio, 0. 70; 95% CI, 0. 57-0. 87; P<. 001). Relative to usual care, hazard ratios among the obese participants were 0. 60 (95% CI, 0. 45-0. 80; P<.
randomized controlled trial	001) for reduced sodium intake alone, 0. 64 (95% CI, 0. 49-0. 85; P=. 002) for weight loss alone, and 0. 47 (95% CI, 0. 35-0. 64; P<. 001) for reduced sodium intake and weight loss combined.
randomized controlled trial	The frequency of cardiovascular events during follow-up was similar in each of the 6 treatment groups.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Reduced sodium intake and weight loss constitute a feasible, effective, and safe nonpharmacologic therapy of hypertension in older persons.
randomized controlled trial	Sodium reduction and weight loss in the treatment of hypertension in older persons: a randomized controlled trial of nonpharmacologic interventions in the elderly (TONE). TONE Collaborative Research Group
randomized controlled trial	Background: Phase 1 of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention was a collaborative, randomized controlled clinical trial designed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of selected nonpharmacologic interventions in reducing or preventing an increase in diastolic blood pressure.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Participants aged 30 to 54 years who had a high-normal diastolic blood pressure (80 to 89 mm Hg), and were between 115% and 165% of their desirable body weight, were randomly assigned to either an 18-month weight loss intervention (n = 308) or a usual-care control condition (N = 256).
randomized controlled trial	Intervention consisted of 14 weekly group meetings followed by monthly maintenance sessions.
randomized controlled trial	Intervention participants received training in behavioral self-management technique and were asked to make life-style changes aimed at achieving a moderate reduction in energy intake and an increase in physical activity.
randomized controlled trial	Results: The average weight losses in the intervention group at 6, 12, and 18 months of follow-up were 6. 5, 5. 6, and 4. 7 kg for men and 3. 7, 2. 7, and 1. 6 kg for women.
randomized controlled trial	The mean (+/- SE) change in diastolic blood pressure for intervention participants compared with controls at termination was -2. 8 +/- 0. 6 mm Hg for men and -1. 1 +/- 0. 9 mm Hg for women. For systolic blood pressure, the corresponding change was -3.
randomized controlled trial	1 +/- 0. 7 mm Hg for men and -2. 0 +/- 1. 3 mm Hg for women. Blood pressure reductions were greater for those who lost larger amounts of weight.
randomized controlled trial	Sex-related differences in blood pressure response were largely due to the smaller amount of weight lost by women, and sex differences in weight loss could be accounted for by differences in baseline body weight.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: During an 18-month follow-up period, this weight reduction program was shown to be an effective nonpharmacologic intervention for reducing blood pressure in overweight adults with high-normal blood pressure.
randomized controlled trial	Weight loss intervention in phase 1 of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention. The TOHP Collaborative Research Group
Cohort study	Background: An effect of diet in determining blood pressure is suggested by epidemiological studies, but the role of specific nutrients is still unsettled.
Cohort study	Methods and results: The relation of various nutritional factors with hypertension was examined prospectively among 30,681 predominantly white US male health professionals, 40-75 years old, without diagnosed hypertension.
Cohort study	During 4 years of follow-up, 1,248 men reported a diagnosis of hypertension. Age, relative weight, and alcohol consumption were the strongest predictors for the development of hypertension.
Cohort study	Dietary fiber, potassium, and magnesium were each significantly associated with lower risk of hypertension when considered individually and after adjustment for age, relative weight, alcohol consumption, and energy intake.
Cohort study	When these nutrients were considered simultaneously, only dietary fiber had an independent inverse association with hypertension. For men with a fiber intake of < 12 g/day, the relative risk of hypertension was 1. 57 (95% confidence interval, 1. 20-2.
Cohort study	05) compared with an intake of > 24 g/day. Calcium was significantly associated with lower risk of hypertension only in lean men.
Cohort study	Dietary fiber, potassium, and magnesium were also inversely related to baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure and to change in blood pressure during the follow-up among men who did not develop hypertension.
Cohort study	Calcium was inversely associated with baseline blood pressure but not with change in blood pressure. No significant associations with hypertension were observed for sodium, total fat, or saturated, transunsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Cohort study	Fruit fiber but not vegetable or cereal fiber was inversely associated with incidence of hypertension. Conclusions: These results support hypotheses that an increased intake of fiber and magnesium may contribute to the prevention of hypertension.
Cohort study	A prospective study of nutritional factors and hypertension among US men
randomized controlled trial	Background: The main 6-month results from the PREMIER trial showed that comprehensive behavioral intervention programs improve lifestyle behaviors and lower blood pressure.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To compare the 18-month effects of 2 multicomponent behavioral interventions versus advice only on hypertension status, lifestyle changes, and blood pressure.
randomized controlled trial	Design: Multicenter, 3-arm, randomized trial conducted from January 2000 through November 2002. Setting: 4 clinical centers and a coordinating center.
randomized controlled trial	Patients: 810 adult volunteers with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure, 120 to 159 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, 80 to 95 mm Hg).
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: A multicomponent behavioral intervention that implemented long-established recommendations ("established"); a multicomponent behavioral intervention that implemented the established recommendations plus the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet ("established plus DASH"); and advice only.
randomized controlled trial	Measurements: Lifestyle variables and blood pressure status. Follow-up for blood pressure measurement at 18 months was 94%.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Compared with advice only, both behavioral interventions statistically significantly reduced weight, fat intake, and sodium intake.
randomized controlled trial	The established plus DASH intervention also statistically significantly increased fruit, vegetable, dairy, fiber, and mineral intakes. Relative to the advice only group, the odds ratios for hypertension at 18 months were 0. 83 (95% CI, 0. 67 to 1.
randomized controlled trial	04) for the established group and 0. 77 (CI, 0. 62 to 0. 97) for the established plus DASH group.
randomized controlled trial	Although reductions in absolute blood pressure at 18 months were greater for participants in the established and the established plus DASH groups than for the advice only group, the differences were not statistically significant.
randomized controlled trial	Limitations: The exclusion criteria and the volunteer nature of this cohort may limit generalizability.
randomized controlled trial	Although blood pressure is a well-accepted risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the authors were not able to assess intervention effects on clinical cardiovascular events in this limited time and with this sample size.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Over 18 months, persons with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension can sustain multiple lifestyle modifications that improve control of blood pressure and could reduce the risk for chronic disease.
randomized controlled trial	Effects of comprehensive lifestyle modification on diet, weight, physical fitness, and blood pressure control: 18-month results of a randomized trial
meta analysis	Objective: To quantify the relative risk reductions achieved with different regimens to lower blood pressure in younger and older adults.
meta analysis	Design: Meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses used to compare the effects on the primary outcome between two age groups (<65 v > or =65 years).
meta analysis	Evidence for an interaction between age and the effects of treatment sought by fitting age as a continuous variable and estimating overall effects across trials. Primary outcome: total major cardiovascular events.
meta analysis	Results: 31 trials, with 190 606 participants, were included.
meta analysis	The meta-analyses showed no clear difference between age groups in the effects of lowering blood pressure or any difference between the effects of the drug classes on major cardiovascular events (all P> or =0. 24).
meta analysis	Neither was there any significant interaction between age and treatment when age was fitted as a continuous variable (all P>0. 09).
meta analysis	The meta-regressions also showed no difference in effects between the two age groups for the outcome of major cardiovascular events (<65 v > or =65; P=0. 38).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Reduction of blood pressure produces benefits in younger (<65 years) and older (> or =65 years) adults, with no strong evidence that protection against major vascular events afforded by different drug classes varies substantially with age.
meta analysis	Effects of different regimens to lower blood pressure on major cardiovascular events in older and younger adults: meta-analysis of randomised trials
meta analysis	Background: The effects of pharmacological blood-pressure-lowering on cardiovascular outcomes in individuals aged 70 years and older, particularly when blood pressure is not substantially increased, is uncertain.
meta analysis	We compared the effects of blood-pressure-lowering treatment on the risk of major cardiovascular events in groups of patients stratified by age and blood pressure at baseline.
meta analysis	Methods: We did a meta-analysis using individual participant-level data from randomised controlled trials of pharmacological blood-pressure-lowering versus placebo or other classes of blood-pressure-lowering medications, or between more versus less intensive treatment strategies, which had at least 1000 persons-years of follow-up in each treatment group.
meta analysis	Participants with previous history of heart failure were excluded. Data were obtained from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Triallists' Collaboration.
meta analysis	We pooled the data and categorised participants into baseline age groups (<55 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and ≥85 years) and blood pressure categories (in 10 mm Hg increments from <120 mm Hg to ≥170 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and from <70 mm Hg to ≥110 mm Hg diastolic).
meta analysis	We used a fixed effects one-stage approach and applied Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by trial, to analyse the data.
meta analysis	The primary outcome was defined as either a composite of fatal or non-fatal stroke, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, or heart failure causing death or requiring hospital admission.
meta analysis	Findings: We included data from 358 707 participants from 51 randomised clinical trials.
meta analysis	The age of participants at randomisation ranged from 21 years to 105 years (median 65 years [IQR 59-75]), with 42 960 (12·0%) participants younger than 55 years, 128 437 (35·8%) aged 55-64 years, 128 506 (35·8%) 65-74 years, 54 016 (15·1%) 75-84 years, and 4788 (1·3%) 85 years and older.
meta analysis	The hazard ratios for the risk of major cardiovascular events per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure for each age group were 0·82 (95% CI 0·76-0·88) in individuals younger than 55 years, 0·91 (0·88-0·95) in those aged 55-64 years, 0·91 (0·88-0·95) in those aged 65-74 years, 0·91 (0·87-0·96) in those aged 75-84 years, and 0·99 (0·87-1·12) in those aged 85 years and older (adjusted pinteraction=0·050).
meta analysis	Similar patterns of proportional risk reductions were observed for a 3 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Absolute risk reductions for major cardiovascular events varied by age and were larger in older groups (adjusted pinteraction=0·024).
meta analysis	We did not find evidence for any clinically meaningful heterogeneity of relative treatment effects across different baseline blood pressure categories in any age group.
meta analysis	Interpretation: Pharmacological blood pressure reduction is effective into old age, with no evidence that relative risk reductions for prevention of major cardiovascular events vary by systolic or diastolic blood pressure levels at randomisation, down to less than 120/70 mm Hg.
meta analysis	Pharmacological blood pressure reduction should, therefore, be considered an important treatment option regardless of age, with the removal of age-related blood-pressure thresholds from international guidelines.

meta analysis	Age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and death: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis
meta analysis	Objectives: To determine the quantitative efficacy of different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and who should receive treatment. Design: Meta-analysis. Data source Medline (1966-2007).
meta analysis	Study selection: Randomised trials of blood pressure lowering drugs recording CHD events and strokes.
meta analysis	108 trials studied differences in blood pressure between study drug and placebo (or control group not receiving the study drug) ("blood pressure difference trials"), and 46 trials compared drugs ("drug comparison trials").
meta analysis	Seven trials with three randomised groups fell into both categories. The results were interpreted in the context of those expected from the largest published meta-analysis of cohort studies, totalling 958 000 people.
meta analysis	Participants: 464 000 people defined into three mutually exclusive categories: participants with no history of vascular disease, a history of CHD, or a history of stroke.
meta analysis	Results: In the blood pressure difference trials beta blockers had a special effect over and above that due to blood pressure reduction in preventing recurrent CHD events in people with a history of CHD: risk reduction 29% (95% confidence interval 22% to 34%) compared with 15% (11% to 19%) in trials of other drugs.
meta analysis	The extra effect was limited to a few years after myocardial infarction, with a risk reduction of 31% compared with 13% in people with CHD with no recent infarct (P=0. 04).
meta analysis	In the other blood pressure difference trials (excluding CHD events in trials of beta blockers in people with CHD), there was a 22% reduction in CHD events (17% to 27%) and a 41% (33% to 48%) reduction in stroke for a blood pressure reduction of 10 mm Hg systolic or 5 mm Hg diastolic, similar to the reductions of 25% (CHD) and 36% (stroke) expected for the same difference in blood pressure from the cohort study meta-analysis, indicating that the benefit is explained by blood pressure reduction itself.
meta analysis	The five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs (thiazides, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers) were similarly effective (within a few percentage points) in preventing CHD events and strokes, with the exception that calcium channel blockers had a greater preventive effect on stroke (relative risk 0.
meta analysis	92, 95% confidence interval 0. 85 to 0. 98).
meta analysis	The percentage reductions in CHD events and stroke were similar in people with and without cardiovascular disease and regardless of blood pressure before treatment (down to 110 mm Hg systolic and 70 mm Hg diastolic).
meta analysis	Combining our results with those from two other studies (the meta-analyses of blood pressure cohort studies and of trials determining the blood pressure lowering effects of drugs according to dose) showed that in people aged 60-69 with a diastolic blood pressure before treatment of 90 mm Hg, three drugs at half standard dose in combination reduced the risk of CHD by an estimated 46% and of stroke by 62%; one drug at standard dose had about half this effect.
meta analysis	The present meta-analysis also showed that drugs other than calcium channel blockers (with the exception of non-cardioselective beta blockers) reduced the incidence of heart failure by 24% (19% to 28%) and calcium channel blockers by 19% (6% to 31%).
meta analysis	Conclusions: With the exception of the extra protective effect of beta blockers given shortly after a myocardial infarction and the minor additional effect of calcium channel blockers in preventing stroke, all the classes of blood pressure lowering drugs have a similar effect in reducing CHD events and stroke for a given reduction in blood pressure so excluding material pleiotropic effects.
meta analysis	The proportional reduction in cardiovascular disease events was the same or similar regardless of pretreatment blood pressure and the presence or absence of existing cardiovascular disease.
meta analysis	Guidelines on the use of blood pressure lowering drugs can be simplified so that drugs are offered to people with all levels of blood pressure.
meta analysis	Our results indicate the importance of lowering blood pressure in everyone over a certain age, rather than measuring it in everyone and treating it in some.
meta analysis	Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies
meta analysis	Objective: To review the literature systematically and perform meta-analyses to address these questions: 1) Is there evidence that self-measured blood pressure (BP) without other augmentation is superior to office-based measurement of BP for achieving better BP control or for preventing adverse clinical outcomes that are related to elevated BP? 2) What is the optimal target for BP lowering during antihypertensive therapy in adults? 3) In adults with hypertension, how do various antihypertensive drug classes differ in their benefits and harms compared with each other as first-line therapy? Methods: Electronic literature searches were performed by Doctor Evidence, a global medical evidence software and services company, across PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to 2015 using key words and relevant subject headings for randomized controlled trials that met eligibility criteria defined for each question.
meta analysis	We performed analyses using traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches, including random-effects Bayesian network meta-analyses.
meta analysis	Results: Our results suggest that: 1) There is a modest but significant improvement in systolic BP in randomized controlled trials of self-measured BP versus usual care at 6 but not 12 months, and for selected patients and their providers self-measured BP may be a helpful adjunct to routine office care.
meta analysis	2) systolic BP lowering to a target of <130 mm Hg may reduce the risk of several important outcomes including risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and major cardiovascular events.
meta analysis	No class of medications (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers) was significantly better than thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics as a first-line therapy for any outcome.

review	Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately.
review	Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence.
review	This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults.
review	Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes.
review	There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion.
review	The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years.
review	There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes.
review	In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy.
review	There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes.
review	Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.
review	2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)
meta analysis	Introduction: Unexplained differences between classes of antihypertensive drugs in their effectiveness in preventing stroke might be due to class effects on intraindividual variability in blood pressure.
meta analysis	We did a systematic review to assess any such effects in randomised controlled trials. Methods: Baseline and follow-up data for mean (SD) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) were extracted from trial reports.
meta analysis	Effect of treatment on interindividual variance (SD2) in blood pressure (a surrogate for within-individual variability), expressed as the ratio of the variances (VR), was related to effects on clinical outcomes.
meta analysis	Pooled estimates were derived by use of random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: Mean (SD) SBP at follow-up was reported in 389 (28%) of 1372 eligible trials.
meta analysis	There was substantial heterogeneity between trials in VR (p<1 x 10(-40)), 68% of which was attributable to allocated drug class. Compared with other drugs, interindividual variation in SBP was reduced by calcium-channel blockers (VR 0. 81, 95% CI 0.
meta analysis	76-0. 86, p<0. 0001) and non-loop diuretic drugs (0. 87, 0. 79-0. 96, p=0. 007), and increased by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (1. 08, 1. 02-1. 15, p=0. 008), angiotensin-receptor blockers (1. 16, 1. 07-1. 25, p=0.
meta analysis	0002), and beta blockers (1. 17, 1. 07-1. 28, p=0. 0007). Compared with placebo only, interindividual variation in SBP was reduced the most by calcium-channel blockers (0. 76, 0. 67-0. 85, p<0. 0001).
meta analysis	Effects were consistent in parallel group and crossover design trials, and in analyses of dose-response. Across all trials, effects of treatment on VR of SBP (r2=0. 372, p=0. 0006) and on mean SBP (r2=0. 328, p=0.
meta analysis	0015) accounted for effects on stroke risk (eg, odds ratio 0. 79, 0. 71-0. 87, p<0. 0001, for VR< or =0. 80), and both remained significant in a combined model.
meta analysis	Interpretation: Drug-class effects on interindividual variation in blood pressure can account for differences in effects of antihypertensive drugs on risk of stroke independently of effects on mean SBP. Funding: None.
meta analysis	Effects of antihypertensive-drug class on interindividual variation in blood pressure and risk of stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Objective: To quantify the incremental effect of combining blood pressure-lowering drugs from any 2 classes of thiazides, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers over 1 drug alone and to compare the effects of combining drugs with doubling dose.
meta analysis	Methods: Meta-analysis of factorial trials in which participants were randomly allocated to 1 drug alone, another drug alone, both drugs together, or a placebo. Results: We identified 42 trials (10,968 participants).
meta analysis	With a thiazide used alone, the mean placebo-subtracted reduction in systolic blood pressure was 7. 3 mm Hg and 14. 6 mm Hg combined with a drug from another class. The corresponding reductions were 9. 3 mm Hg and 18. 9 mm Hg with a beta-blocker, 6.
meta analysis	8 mm Hg and 13. 9 mm Hg with an angiotensin-converting enzyme, and 8. 4 mm Hg and 14. 3 mm Hg with a calcium channel blocker.
meta analysis	The expected blood pressure reduction from 2 drugs together, assuming an additive effect, closely predicted the observed blood pressure reductions.
meta analysis	The ratios of the observed to expected incremental blood pressure reductions from combining each class of drug with any other over that from 1 drug were, respectively, for thiazides, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers: 1.
meta analysis	04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 88-1. 20), 1. 00 (95% CI, 0. 76-1. 24), 1. 16 (95% CI, 0. 93-1. 39), and 0. 89 (95% CI, 0. 69-1. 09); the overall average was 1. 01 (95% CI, 0. 90-1. 12).
meta analysis	Comparison of our results with those of a published meta-analysis of different doses of the same drug showed that doubling the dose of 1 drug had approximately one fifth of the equivalent incremental effect (0. 22 [95% CI, 0. 19-0. 25]).
meta analysis	Conclusion: Blood pressure reduction from combining drugs from these 4 classes can be predicted on the basis of additive effects.
meta analysis	The extra blood pressure reduction from combining drugs from 2 different classes is approximately 5 times greater than doubling the dose of 1 drug.

review	Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as above-goal elevated blood pressure (BP) in a patient despite the concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), and a diuretic.
review	The antihypertensive drugs should be administered at maximum or maximally tolerated daily doses. RH also includes patients whose BP achieves target values on ≥4 antihypertensive medications.
review	The diagnosis of RH requires assurance of antihypertensive medication adherence and exclusion of the "white-coat effect" (office BP above goal but out-of-office BP at or below target).
review	The importance of RH is underscored by the associated risk of adverse outcomes compared with non-RH. This article is an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on the detection, evaluation, and management of RH.
review	Once antihypertensive medication adherence is confirmed and out-of-office BP recordings exclude a white-coat effect, evaluation includes identification of contributing lifestyle issues, detection of drugs interfering with antihypertensive medication effectiveness, screening for secondary hypertension, and assessment of target organ damage.
review	Management of RH includes maximization of lifestyle interventions, use of long-acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone or indapamide), addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and, if BP remains elevated, stepwise addition of antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to lower BP.
review	If BP remains uncontrolled, referral to a hypertension specialist is advised.

review	Over the past 2 decades, nifedipine in the form of capsules has become widely popular in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.
review	Unlike other agents, such as sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine hydrochloride, diazoxide, and nitroglycerin--which require intravenous administration and monitoring of blood pressure--nifedipine can be given orally, and close monitoring is said not to be necessary.
review	Although administration of nifedipine capsules has been reported to be expedient and safe, it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for labeling for treatment of hypertensive emergencies or of any other form of hypertension because of lack of outcome data.
review	A review of the literature revealed reports of serious adverse effects such as cerebrovascular ischemia, stroke, numerous instances of severe hypotension, acute myocardial infarction, conduction disturbances, fetal distress, and death.
review	Sublingual absorption of nifedipine has been found to be poor; most of the drug is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa.
review	Given the seriousness of the reported adverse events and the lack of any clinical documentation attesting to a benefit, the use of nifedipine capsules for hypertensive emergencies and pseudoemergencies should be abandoned.
review	Should a moratorium be placed on sublingual nifedipine capsules given for hypertensive emergencies and pseudoemergencies?
review	The benefits of continuous antihypertensive therapy have been extensively documented.
review	However, lack of compliance with the prescribed regimen, excessive cost, and troublesome adverse effects of some antihypertensive agents led to the consideration of intermittent therapy or even complete discontinuation of therapy as an effective alternative to lifelong medication.
review	Prospective studies dealing with this subject reported inconsistent results. Nevertheless, they allowed us to identify selection criteria of candidates for step-down or discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy.
review	Such candidates include patients with mild essential hypertension who have one or more of the following characteristics: young age, normal body weight, low salt intake, no alcohol consumption, low pretreatment blood pressure, successful therapy with one drug only, and no or only minimal signs of target organ damage.
review	Stopping antihypertensive therapy without subsequent rise in arterial pressure was shown to be possible in a subset of patients with mild essential hypertension for a period of months to years.
review	This approach appears to be safe, provided that blood pressure is monitored frequently, and may improve compliance, save treatment costs, and reduce adverse effects of certain drugs, although its long-term consequences for morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.
review	Antihypertensive therapy. To stop or not to stop?
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Antihypertensive drug therapy is considered lifelong but in the family practice environment drug cessation may provide an opportunity to attempt nonpharmacologic strategies for blood pressure (BP) control with a clear outcome, maintaining drug-free status.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The identification of simple predictors would assist the family physician to select who may or may not have their medication ceased.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: To monitor a drug cessation program in currently treated hypertensive patients in Australian family practice, 25,826 patients aged 65 to 84 years currently receiving antihypertensive medication, were offered drug withdrawal as part of the run-in phase of a large clinical trial.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Outcomes investigated were the proportion of patients completing drug withdrawal and maintaining short-term BP control and factors that predicted these patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 18,993 patients did not enter the withdrawal program; 6291 (92% of those who entered) completed drug withdrawal. In comparison to patients who did not complete drug withdrawal, they were younger and more likely male.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A total of 1,228 (18% of those who entered) ceased medication and maintained adequate BP control for 0 to 76 weeks (median, 4 weeks).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Cox regression analysis identified lower on therapy systolic and diastolic BP, younger age, type of agent, and monotherapy as predictors of successful drug withdrawal and maintenance of BP control.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Cessation of antihypertensive drug therapy is possible in a substantial proportion (18%) of patients attending family practice who are willing to do so and is most successful in those who are younger with BP controlled on monotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Where this strategy is initiated, use of such predictors, effective behavioral change, and systematic follow-up is recommended.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Short-term predictors of maintenance of normotension after withdrawal of antihypertensive drugs in the second Australian National Blood Pressure Study (ANBP2)
Non-randomized controlled trial	The possibility of discontinuing--compared to reducing--antihypertensive drug treatment was investigated in 606 male hypertensive patients with entry diastolic blood pressure (BP) in the range of 90 to 114 mm Hg.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Diastolic BP was controlled at less than 90 mm Hg with 1 of 4 regimens: low dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 25 mg twice daily; high dose HCTZ, 50 mg twice daily; or high dose HCTZ plus a low or high dose of a step II drug (propranolol, clonidine or reserpine).
Non-randomized controlled trial	After 6 months of treatment that controlled BP, dosages were reduced in two-thirds of the patients. In those patients receiving low dose HCTZ and randomized to dose reduction, antihypertensive drugs were completely discontinued.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although approximately half of these patients remained normotensive for the first 6 months, a significantly greater proportion had elevation of BP compared to the control group, which continued to receive treatment (p less than 0. 0001).
Non-randomized controlled trial	In the high dose HCTZ drug group, the proportion of patients remaining normotensive did not differ among those stepped down to low dose HCTZ and the fully treated control group.
Non-randomized controlled trial	While not achieving significance the trend was similar with the step II regimens. Although some patients remained normotensive after discontinuation of step II drugs, a greater proportion returned to elevated BP than when step II dosage was unchanged.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Therefore, while stopping therapy may be effective in some patients, a decreased dosage is significantly more effective as a method for maintaining an antihypertensive effect.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Decreasing drug dosages offers the dual benefit of minimizing side effects and reducing drug costs.

randomized controlled trial	Background: The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer is not well established.
randomized controlled trial	We compared chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in this patient population.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We randomly assigned patients with resectable tumors to receive surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (41.
randomized controlled trial	4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery.
randomized controlled trial	Results: From March 2004 through December 2008, we enrolled 368 patients, 366 of whom were included in the analysis: 275 (75%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23%) had squamous-cell carcinoma, and 7 (2%) had large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Of the 366 patients, 178 were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, and 188 to surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	The most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group were leukopenia (6%) and neutropenia (2%); the most common major nonhematologic toxic effects were anorexia (5%) and fatigue (3%).
randomized controlled trial	Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92% of patients in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69% in the surgery group (P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4% in both.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 49. 4 months in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 24. 0 months in the surgery group. Overall survival was significantly better in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.
randomized controlled trial	657; 95% confidence interval, 0. 495 to 0. 871; P=0. 003). Conclusions: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	The regimen was associated with acceptable adverse-event rates. (Funded by the Dutch Cancer Foundation [KWF Kankerbestrijding]; Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR487. ).

randomized controlled trial	Background: Initial results of the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) comparing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction showed a significant increase in 5-year overall survival in favour of the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group after a median of 45 months' follow-up.
randomized controlled trial	In this Article, we report the long-term results after a minimum follow-up of 5 years.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients with clinically resectable, locally advanced cancer of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction (clinical stage T1N1M0 or T2-3N0-1M0, according to the TNM cancer staging system, sixth edition) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with permuted blocks of four or six to receive either weekly administration of five cycles of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (intravenous carboplatin [AUC 2 mg/mL per min] and intravenous paclitaxel [50 mg/m(2) of body-surface area] for 23 days) with concurrent radiotherapy (41·4 Gy, given in 23 fractions of 1·8 Gy on 5 days per week) followed by surgery, or surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention-to-treat. No adverse event data were collected beyond those noted in the initial report of the trial.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR487, and has been completed.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between March 30, 2004, and Dec 2, 2008, 368 patients from eight participating centres (five academic centres and three large non-academic teaching hospitals) in the Netherlands were enrolled into this study and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 180 to surgery plus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and 188 to surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	Two patients in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group withdrew consent, so a total of 366 patients were analysed (178 in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 188 in the surgery alone group).
randomized controlled trial	Of 171 patients who received any neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in this group, 162 (95%) were able to complete the entire neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen.
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up for surviving patients of 84·1 months (range 61·1-116·8, IQR 70·7-96·6), median overall survival was 48·6 months (95% CI 32·1-65·1) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 24·0 months (14·2-33·7) in the surgery alone group (HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·53-0·88]; log-rank p=0·003).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival for patients with squamous cell carcinomas was 81·6 months (95% CI 47·2-116·0) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 21·1 months (15·4-26·7) in the surgery alone group (HR 0·48 [95% CI 0·28-0·83]; log-rank p=0·008); for patients with adenocarcinomas, it was 43·2 months (24·9-61·4) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group and 27·1 months (13·0-41·2) in the surgery alone group (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·55-0·98]; log-rank p=0·038).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Long-term follow-up confirms the overall survival benefits for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy when added to surgery in patients with resectable oesophageal or oesophagogastric junctional cancer.
randomized controlled trial	This improvement is clinically relevant for both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma subtypes.
randomized controlled trial	Therefore, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy according to the CROSS trial followed by surgical resection should be regarded as a standard of care for patients with resectable locally advanced oesophageal or oesophagogastric junctional cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Background: Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation.
randomized controlled trial	Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab.
randomized controlled trial	Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01041404.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.
randomized controlled trial	6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17. 1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13. 8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.
randomized controlled trial	1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0. 74; 95% CI 0. 60-0. 91; p=0. 0046).
randomized controlled trial	The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]).
randomized controlled trial	Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. Funding: F Hoffmann-La Roche.

randomized controlled trial	Background: The detection of high-grade dysplasia and cancer in Barrett's esophagus (BE) can be challenging. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows in vivo visualization of mucosal histology during endoscopy.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To determine whether CLE with optical biopsy and targeted mucosal biopsy improves the diagnostic yield of endoscopically inapparent, BE-associated neoplasia compared to standard endoscopy with a 4-quadrant, random biopsy protocol.
randomized controlled trial	Design: Prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Setting: Single, tertiary-care academic center.
randomized controlled trial	Patients: This study involved patients with BE undergoing routine surveillance or referred for treatment of nonlocalized, endoscopically inapparent, BE-associated neoplasia.
randomized controlled trial	Intervention: All participants underwent both a confocal endomicroscopy with a targeted biopsy procedure and standard endoscopy with a 4-quadrant biopsy procedure in a randomized order.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcome measurements: Increase in diagnostic yield for neoplasia, reduction in mucosal biopsy number, final pathologic diagnosis.
randomized controlled trial	Results: CLE with targeted biopsy almost doubled the diagnostic yield for neoplasia and was equivalent to the standard protocol for the final diagnosis of neoplasia.
randomized controlled trial	Two thirds of patients in the surveillance group did not need any mucosal biopsies at all. Limitation: Single-center study.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: CLE with targeted biopsy significantly improves the diagnostic yield for endoscopically inapparent BE neoplasia compared to a standard endoscopy with a random-biopsy protocol.
randomized controlled trial	CLE with targeted biopsy also greatly reduces the number of biopsies needed per patient and allows some patients without neoplasia to completely forgo mucosal biopsy.
randomized controlled trial	Confocal laser endomicroscopy in Barrett's esophagus and endoscopically inapparent Barrett's neoplasia: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover trial
randomized controlled trial	Background & aims: Endoscopic tri-modal imaging (ETMI) incorporates high-resolution endoscopy (HRE), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), and narrow band imaging (NBI).
randomized controlled trial	A recent uncontrolled study found that ETMI improved the detection of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early carcinoma (Ca) in Barrett's esophagus (BE).
randomized controlled trial	The aim was to compare ETMI with standard video endoscopy (SVE) for the detection of HGD/Ca with the use of a randomized cross-over design.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients referred for work-up of inconspicuous HGD/Ca were eligible and underwent both SVE and ETMI in randomized order within an interval of 6-12 weeks. During ETMI, inspection with HRE was followed by AFI.
randomized controlled trial	Detected lesions were inspected in detail with NBI and biopsied, followed by random biopsies. During SVE, any visible lesion was biopsied followed by random biopsies. Results: Eighty-seven patients with BE underwent ETMI and SVE.
randomized controlled trial	No significant difference was observed in overall histologic yield between ETMI and SVE. ETMI had a significantly higher targeted yield compared with SVE because of AFI.
randomized controlled trial	However, the yield of targeted biopsies of ETMI was significantly inferior to the overall yield of SVE.
randomized controlled trial	Detailed inspection with NBI reduced the false-positive rate of HRE + AFI from 71% to 48% but misclassified 17% of HGD/Ca lesions as not suspicious.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: ETMI statistically significant improves the targeted detection of HGD/Ca compared with SVE. Subsequent characterization of lesions with NBI appears to be of limited value.
randomized controlled trial	At this stage, ETMI cannot replace random biopsies for detection of lesions or targeted biopsies for characterization of lesions in a high-risk population.
randomized controlled trial	Endoscopic tri-modal imaging is more effective than standard endoscopy in identifying early-stage neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Background: For endoscopic resection of early GI neoplasia, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) achieves higher rates of complete resection (R0) than endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR).
randomized controlled trial	However, ESD is technically more difficult and evidence from randomised trial is missing. Objective: We compared the efficacy and safety of ESD and EMR in patients with neoplastic Barrett's oesophagus (BO).
randomized controlled trial	Design: BO patients with a focal lesion of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or early adenocarcinoma (EAC) ≤3 cm were randomised to either ESD or EMR.
randomized controlled trial	Primary outcome was R0 resection; secondary outcomes were complete remission from neoplasia, recurrences and adverse events (AEs).
randomized controlled trial	Results: There were no significant differences in patient and lesion characteristics between the groups randomised to ESD (n=20) or EMR (n=20). Histology of the resected specimen showed HGIN or EAC in all but six cases.
randomized controlled trial	Although R0 resection defined as margins free of HGIN/EAC was achieved more frequently with ESD (10/17 vs 2/17, p=0. 01), there was no difference in complete remission from neoplasia at 3 months (ESD 15/16 vs EMR 16/17, p=1. 0).
randomized controlled trial	During a mean follow-up period of 23. 1±6. 4 months, recurrent EAC was observed in one case in the ESD group. Elective surgery was performed in four and three cases after ESD and EMR, respectively (p=1. 0).
randomized controlled trial	Two severe AEs were recorded for ESD and none for EMR (p=0. 49). Conclusions: In terms of need for surgery, neoplasia remission and recurrence, ESD and EMR are both highly effective for endoscopic resection of early BO neoplasia.
randomized controlled trial	ESD achieves a higher R0 resection rate, but for most BO patients this bears little clinical relevance. ESD is, however, more time consuming and may cause severe AE. Trial registration number: NCT1871636.
randomized controlled trial	A randomised trial of endoscopic submucosal dissection versus endoscopic mucosal resection for early Barrett's neoplasia
randomized controlled trial	Background: Surgical resection is regarded as the only curative option for resectable oesophageal cancer, but pulmonary complications occurring in more than half of patients after open oesophagectomy are a great concern.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether minimally invasive oesophagectomy reduces morbidity compared with open oesophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at five study centres in three countries between June 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18-75 years with resectable cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive either open transthoracic or minimally invasive transthoracic oesophagectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was stratified by centre. Patients, and investigators undertaking interventions, assessing outcomes, and analysing data, were not masked to group assignment.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome was pulmonary infection within the first 2 weeks after surgery and during the whole stay in hospital. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR TC 2452.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: We randomly assigned 56 patients to the open oesophagectomy group and 59 to the minimally invasive oesophagectomy group.
randomized controlled trial	16 (29%) patients in the open oesophagectomy group had pulmonary infection in the first 2 weeks compared with five (9%) in the minimally invasive group (relative risk [RR] 0·30, 95% CI 0·12-0·76; p=0·005).
randomized controlled trial	19 (34%) patients in the open oesophagectomy group had pulmonary infection in-hospital compared with seven (12%) in the minimally invasive group (0·35, 0·16-0·78; p=0·005).
randomized controlled trial	For in-hospital mortality, one patient in the open oesophagectomy group died from anastomotic leakage and two in the minimally invasive group from aspiration and mediastinitis after anastomotic leakage.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: These findings provide evidence for the short-term benefits of minimally invasive oesophagectomy for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy for patients with oesophageal cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Postoperative complications, especially pulmonary complications, affect more than half the patients who undergo open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Whether hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy results in lower morbidity than open esophagectomy is unclear.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial involving patients 18 to 75 years of age with resectable cancer of the middle or lower third of the esophagus.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned to undergo transthoracic open esophagectomy (open procedure) or hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (hybrid procedure).
randomized controlled trial	Surgical quality assurance was implemented by the credentialing of surgeons, standardization of technique, and monitoring of performance.
randomized controlled trial	Hybrid surgery comprised a two-field abdominal-thoracic operation (also called an Ivor-Lewis procedure) with laparoscopic gastric mobilization and open right thoracotomy.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was intraoperative or postoperative complication of grade II or higher according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (indicating major complication leading to intervention) within 30 days.
randomized controlled trial	Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results: From October 2009 through April 2012, we randomly assigned 103 patients to the hybrid-procedure group and 104 to the open-procedure group.
randomized controlled trial	A total of 312 serious adverse events were recorded in 110 patients.
randomized controlled trial	A total of 37 patients (36%) in the hybrid-procedure group had a major intraoperative or postoperative complication, as compared with 67 (64%) in the open-procedure group (odds ratio, 0. 31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 18 to 0. 55; P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	A total of 18 of 102 patients (18%) in the hybrid-procedure group had a major pulmonary complication, as compared with 31 of 103 (30%) in the open-procedure group.
randomized controlled trial	At 3 years, overall survival was 67% (95% CI, 57 to 75) in the hybrid-procedure group, as compared with 55% (95% CI, 45 to 64) in the open-procedure group; disease-free survival was 57% (95% CI, 47 to 66) and 48% (95% CI, 38 to 57), respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: We found that hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy resulted in a lower incidence of intraoperative and postoperative major complications, specifically pulmonary complications, than open esophagectomy, without compromising overall and disease-free survival over a period of 3 years.

randomized controlled trial	Hybrid Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Definitive chemoradiotherapy is a curative treatment option for oesophageal carcinoma, especially in patients unsuitable for surgery.
randomized controlled trial	The PRODIGE5/ACCORD17 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FOLFOX treatment regimen (fluorouracil plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin) versus fluorouracil and cisplatin as part of chemoradiotherapy in patients with localised oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 2/3 trial of patients aged 18 years or older enrolled from 24 centres in France between Oct 15, 2004, and Aug 25, 2011.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible participants had confirmed stage I-IVA oesophageal carcinoma (adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell, or adenosquamous), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0-2, sufficient caloric intake, adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function, and had been selected to receive definitive chemoradiotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either six cycles (three concomitant to radiotherapy) of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2), and infusional fluorouracil 1600 mg/m(2) (FOLFOX) over 46 h, or four cycles (two concomitant to radiotherapy) of fluorouracil 1000 mg/m(2) per day for 4 days and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1.
randomized controlled trial	Both groups also received 50 Gy radiotherapy in 25 fractions (five fractions per week).
randomized controlled trial	Random allocation to treatment groups was done by a central computerised randomisation procedure by minimisation, stratified by centre, histology, weight loss, and ECOG status, and was achieved independently from the study investigators.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Data analysis was primarily done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00861094.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 134 participants were randomly allocated to the FOLFOX group and 133 to the fluorouracil and cisplatin group (intention-to-treat population), and 131 patients in the FOLFOX group and 128 in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group actually received the study drugs (safety population).
randomized controlled trial	Median follow-up was 25·3 months (IQR 15·9-36·4). Median progression-free survival was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·1-14·5) in the FOLFOX group and 9·4 months (8·1-10·6) in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group (HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·70-1·24; p=0·64).
randomized controlled trial	One toxic death occurred in the FOLFOX group and six in the fluorouracil-cisplatin group (p=0·066). No significant differences were recorded in the rates of most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events between the treatment groups.
randomized controlled trial	Of all-grade adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of patients, paraesthesia (61 [47%] events in 131 patients in the FOLFOX group vs three [2%] in 128 patients in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group, p<0·0001), sensory neuropathy (24 [18%] vs one [1%], p<0·0001), increases in aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (14 [11%] vs two [2%], p=0·002), and increases in alanine aminotransferase concentrations (11 [8%] vs two [2%], p=0·012) were more common in the FOLFOX group, whereas serum creatinine increases (four [3%] vs 15 [12%], p=0·007), mucositis (35 [27%] vs 41 [32%], p=0·011), and alopecia (two [2%] vs 12 [9%], p=0·005) were more common in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Although chemoradiotherapy with FOLFOX did not increase progression-free survival compared with chemoradiotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin, FOLFOX might be a more convenient option for patients with localised oesophageal cancer unsuitable for surgery.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment for esophageal carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This study evaluated the docetaxel-based definitive concomitant chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to determine its clinical response and overall survival.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In this unicenter trail, we enrolled 59 patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma in the esophagus between March 2004 and December 2007. All patients were staged II to IV and treated with definitive concomitant chemoradiotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Radiotherapy was delivered with conventional fraction, 50-64 Gy in 25-35 fractions. Patients received two cycles of a 1-day regimen containing docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks during the period of radiotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The chemoradiotherapy was applied as planned in all patients and the median chemotherapy delay time was 6 days (ranging from 2 to 8 days). The overall response rate for 59 evaluable patients was 98.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3%, with 42 complete responses and 26 partial responses. During the follow-up time (median 18 months, 4 approximately 53 months), the median overall survival time was 22. 6 months.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The rate of locoregional progression-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival in 3 years was 59. 6%, 29. 2%, and 36. 7%, respectively. Hematologic toxicity Grade 3 and Grade 4 were observed in 39. 0% and 20.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3% of patients respectively, with severe non-hematologic acute toxicity being infrequent. Eleven patients had pleural effusion after chemoradiotherapy and four of them required therapeutic thoracentesis.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Definitive concomitant chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin in squamous cell esophageal carcinoma was associated with a satisfactory outcome and manageable toxicity.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Endoscopic cryotherapy is a new technique for ablation of esophageal dysplasia and neoplasia. Preliminary studies have shown it to be safe and effective for this indication.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The objective of this study is to characterize safety, tolerability, and efficacy of low-pressure liquid nitrogen endoscopic spray cryotherapy ablation in a large cohort across multiple study sites.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Parallel prospective treatment studies at four tertiary care academic medical centers in the U. S.
Non-randomized controlled trial	assessed spray cryotherapy in patients with Barrett's esophagus with or without dysplasia, early stage esophageal cancer, and severe squamous dysplasia who underwent cryotherapy ablation of the esophagus.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All patients were contacted between 1 and 10 days after treatment to assess for side effects and complications of treatment. The main outcome measurement was the incidence of serious adverse events and side effects from treatment.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Complete response for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) (CR-HGD), all dysplasia (CR-D), intestinal metaplasia (CR-IM) and cancer (CR-C) were assessed in patients completing therapy during the study period.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A total of 77 patients were treated for Barrett's high-grade dysplasia (58. 4%), intramucosal carcinoma (16. 9%), invasive carcinoma (13%), Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia (9. 1%), and severe squamous dysplasia (2. 6%). Twenty-two patients (28.
Non-randomized controlled trial	6%) reported no side effects throughout treatment. In 323 procedures, the most common complaint was chest pain (17. 6%) followed by dysphagia (13. 3%), odynophagia (12. 1%), and sore throat (9. 6%). The mean duration of any symptoms was 3. 6 days.
Non-randomized controlled trial	No side effects were reported in 48% of the procedures (155/323). Symptoms did not correlate with age, gender, diagnosis, or to treatment early versus late in the patient's or site's experience.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Logit analysis showed that symptoms were greater in those with a Barrett's segment of 6 cm or longer. Gastric perforation occurred in one patient with Marfan's syndrome. Esophageal stricture developed in three, all successfully treated with dilation.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In 17 HGD patients, cryotherapy produced CR-HGD, CR-D, and CR-IM of 94%, 88%, and 53%, respectively. Complete regression of cancer and HGD was seen in all seven patients with intramucosal carcinoma or stage I esophageal cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Endoscopic spray cryotherapy ablation using low-pressure liquid nitrogen in the esophagus is safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of endoscopic low-pressure liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy in the esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Background: The efficacy of conventional treatment with surgery and radiation for cancer of the esophagus is limited. The median survival is less than 10 months, and less than 10 percent of patients survive for 5 years.
randomized controlled trial	Recent studies have suggested that combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy may result in improved survival.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This phase III prospective, randomized, and stratified trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of four courses of combined fluorouracil (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area daily for four days) and cisplatin (75 mg per square meter on the first day) plus 5000 cGy of radiation therapy, as compared with 6400 cGy of radiation therapy alone, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus.
randomized controlled trial	The trial was stopped after the accumulated results in 121 patients demonstrated a significant advantage for survival in the patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Results: The median survival was 8.
randomized controlled trial	9 months in the radiation-treated patients, as compared with 12. 5 months in the patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
randomized controlled trial	In the former group, the survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 33 percent and 10 percent, respectively, whereas they were 50 percent and 38 percent in the patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Seven patients in the radiotherapy group and 25 in the combined-therapy group were alive at the time of the analysis. The patients who received combined treatment had fewer local (P less than 0. 02) and fewer distant (P less than 0. 01) recurrences.
randomized controlled trial	Severe and life-threatening side effects occurred in 44 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the patients who received combined therapy, as compared with 25 percent and 3 percent of those treated with radiation alone.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Concurrent therapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil and radiation is superior to radiation therapy alone in patients with localized carcinoma of the esophagus, as measured by control of local tumors, distant metastases, and survival, but at the cost of increased side effects.
randomized controlled trial	Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with cancer of the esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Context: Carcinoma of the esophagus traditionally has been treated by surgery or radiation therapy (RT), but 5-year overall survival rates have been only 5% to 10%.
randomized controlled trial	We previously reported results of a study conducted from January 1986 to April 1990 of combined chemotherapy and RT vs RT alone when an interim analysis revealed significant benefit for combined therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To report the long-term outcomes of a previously reported trial designed to determine if adding chemotherapy during RT improves the survival rate of patients with esophageal carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Design: Randomized controlled trial conducted 1985 to 1990 with follow-up of at least 5 years, followed by a prospective cohort study conducted between May 1990 and April 1991.
randomized controlled trial	Setting: Multi-institution participation, ranging from tertiary academic referral centers to general community practices.
randomized controlled trial	Patients: Patients had squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, T1-3 N0-1 M0, adequate renal and bone marrow reserve, and a Karnofsky score of at least 50.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions Combined modality therapy (n = 134): 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, plus cisplatin intravenously on the first day of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11, and fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per day by continuous infusion on the first 4 days of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11.
randomized controlled trial	In the randomized study, combined therapy was compared with RT only (n = 62): 64 Gy in 32 fractions over 6. 4 weeks. Main outcome measures: Overall survival, patterns of failure, and toxic effects.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Combined therapy significantly increased overall survival compared with RT alone.
randomized controlled trial	In the randomized part of the trial, at 5 years of follow-up the overall survival for combined therapy was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-37%) compared with 0% following RT.
randomized controlled trial	In the succeeding nonrandomized part, combined therapy produced a 5-year overall survival of 14% (95% CI, 6%-23%).
randomized controlled trial	Persistence of disease (despite therapy) was the most common mode of treatment failure; however, it was less common in the groups receiving combined therapy (34/130 [26%]) than in the group treated with RT only (23/62 [37%]).
randomized controlled trial	Severe acute toxic effects also were greater in the combined therapy groups. There were no significant differences in severe late toxic effects between the groups.
randomized controlled trial	However, chemotherapy could be administered as planned in only 89 (68%) of 130 patients (10% had life-threatening toxic effects with combined therapy vs 2% in the RT only group).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Combined therapy increases the survival of patients who have squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, T1-3 N0-1 M0, compared with RT alone.
randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced esophageal cancer: long-term follow-up of a prospective randomized trial (RTOG 85-01). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To compare the local/regional control, survival, and toxicity of combined-modality therapy using high-dose (64. 8 Gy) versus standard-dose (50. 4 Gy) radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: A total of 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to T4, N0/1, M0 squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma selected for a nonsurgical approach, after stratification by weight loss, primary tumor size, and histology, were randomized to receive combined-modality therapy consisting of four monthly cycles of fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 4 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) bolus day 1) with concurrent 64.
randomized controlled trial	8 Gy versus the same chemotherapy schedule but with concurrent 50. 4 Gy. The trial was stopped after an interim analysis. The median follow-up was 16. 4 months for all patients and 29. 5 months for patients still alive.
randomized controlled trial	Results: For the 218 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in median survival (13. 0 v 18.
randomized controlled trial	1 months), 2-year survival (31% v 40%), or local/regional failure and local/regional persistence of disease (56% v 52%) between the high-dose and standard-dose arms.
randomized controlled trial	Although 11 treatment-related deaths occurred in the high-dose arm compared with two in the standard-dose arm, seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients who had received 50. 4 Gy or less.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local/regional control.
randomized controlled trial	Although there was a higher treatment-related mortality rate in the patients assigned to the high-dose radiation arm, it did not seem to be related to the higher radiation dose.
randomized controlled trial	The standard radiation dose for patients treated with concurrent 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy is 50. 4 Gy.
randomized controlled trial	INT 0123 (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 94-05) phase III trial of combined-modality therapy for esophageal cancer: high-dose versus standard-dose radiation therapy
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To analyze recurrence patterns in patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with either preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) plus surgery or surgery alone.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Recurrence pattern was analyzed in patients from the previously published CROSS I and II trials in relation to radiation target volumes.
randomized controlled trial	CRT consisted of five weekly courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin combined with a concurrent radiation dose of 41. 4 Gy in 1. 8-Gy fractions to the tumor and pathologic lymph nodes with margin.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 422 patients included from 2001 to 2008, 418 were available for analysis. Histology was mostly adenocarcinoma (75%). Of the 374 patients who underwent resection, 86% were allocated to surgery and 92% to CRT plus surgery.
randomized controlled trial	On January 1, 2011, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months (median, 45 months), the overall recurrence rate in the surgery arm was 58% versus 35% in the CRT plus surgery arm. Preoperative CRT reduced locoregional recurrence (LRR) from 34% to 14% (P <.
randomized controlled trial	001) and peritoneal carcinomatosis from 14% to 4% (P <. 001). There was a small but significant effect on hematogenous dissemination in favor of the CRT group (35% v 29%; P =. 025).
randomized controlled trial	LRR occurred in 5% within the target volume, in 2% in the margins, and in 6% outside the radiation target volume. In 1%, the exact site in relation to the target volume was unclear. Only 1% had an isolated infield recurrence after CRT plus surgery.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Preoperative CRT in patients with esophageal cancer reduced LRR and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Recurrence within the radiation target volume occurred in only 5%, mostly combined with outfield failures.
randomized controlled trial	Patterns of recurrence after surgery alone versus preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery in the CROSS trials
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Although often investigated in locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC), the impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) in early stages is unknown.
randomized controlled trial	The aim of this multicenter randomized phase III trial was to assess whether NCRT improves outcomes for patients with stage I or II EC. Methods: The primary end point was overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary end points were disease-free survival, postoperative morbidity, in-hospital mortality, R0 resection rate, and prognostic factor identification.
randomized controlled trial	From June 2000 to June 2009, 195 patients in 30 centers were randomly assigned to surgery alone (group S; n = 97) or NCRT followed by surgery (group CRT; n = 98).
randomized controlled trial	CRT protocol was 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with two courses of concomitant chemotherapy composed of fluorouracil 800 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2). We report the long-term results of the final analysis, after a median follow-up of 93.
randomized controlled trial	6 months. Results: Pretreatment disease was stage I in 19. 0%, IIA in 53. 3%, and IIB in 27. 7% of patients. For group CRT compared with group S, R0 resection rate was 93. 8% versus 92. 1% (P =. 749), with 3-year overall survival rate of 47.
randomized controlled trial	5% versus 53. 0% (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 99; 95% CI, 0. 69 to 1. 40; P =. 94) and postoperative mortality rate of 11. 1% versus 3. 4% (P =. 049), respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Because interim analysis of the primary end point revealed an improbability of demonstrating the superiority of either treatment arm (HR, 1. 09; 95% CI, 0. 75 to 1. 59; P =. 66), the trial was stopped for anticipated futility.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Compared with surgery alone, NCRT with cisplatin plus fluorouracil does not improve R0 resection rate or survival but enhances postoperative mortality in patients with stage I or II EC.
randomized controlled trial	Surgery alone versus chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for stage I and II esophageal cancer: final analysis of randomized controlled phase III trial FFCD 9901
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy according to the chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer followed by surgery study (CROSS) has become a standard of care for patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal or junctional cancer.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to assess long-term outcome of this regimen. Methods: From 2004 through 2008, we randomly assigned 366 patients to either five weekly cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy (41.
randomized controlled trial	4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week) followed by surgery, or surgery alone. Follow-up data were collected through 2018.
randomized controlled trial	Cox regression analyses were performed to compare overall survival, cause-specific survival, and risks of locoregional and distant relapse.
randomized controlled trial	The effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy beyond 5 years of follow-up was tested with time-dependent Cox regression and landmark analyses. Results: The median follow-up was 147 months (interquartile range, 134-157).
randomized controlled trial	Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy had better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 70; 95% CI, 0. 55 to 0. 89). The effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on overall survival was not time-dependent (P value for interaction, P =.
randomized controlled trial	73), and landmark analyses suggested a stable effect on overall survival up to 10 years of follow-up. The absolute 10-year overall survival benefit was 13% (38% v 25%). Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy reduced risk of death from esophageal cancer (HR, 0.
randomized controlled trial	60; 95% CI, 0. 46 to 0. 80). Death from other causes was similar between study arms (HR, 1. 17; 95% CI, 0. 68 to 1. 99). Although a clear effect on isolated locoregional (HR, 0. 40; 95% CI, 0. 21 to 0.
randomized controlled trial	72) and synchronous locoregional plus distant relapse (HR, 0. 43; 95% CI, 0. 26 to 0. 72) persisted, isolated distant relapse was comparable (HR, 0. 76; 95% CI, 0. 52 to 1. 13).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The overall survival benefit of patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal or junctional cancer who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy according to CROSS persists for at least 10 years.
randomized controlled trial	Ten-Year Outcome of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Plus Surgery for Esophageal Cancer: The Randomized Controlled CROSS Trial
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To identify a dose and schedule of oxaliplatin (OXP) to be safely administered in combination with protracted-infusion (PI) fluorouracil (5-FU) and external-beam radiation therapy (XRT) for patients with primary esophageal carcinoma (EC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligibility included therapeutically naïve EC patients with clinical disease stages II, III, or IV.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Initial doses and schedules for cycle 1 consisted of OXP 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; PI 5-FU 180 mg/m(2) for 24 hours for 35 days; and XRT 1. 8 Gy in 28 fractions starting on day 8.
Non-randomized controlled trial	At completion of cycle 1, eligible patients could undergo an operation or begin cycle 2 without XRT. Postoperative patients were eligible for cycle 2. Stage IV patients were allowed three cycles in the absence of disease progression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	OXP and 5-FU increases were based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) encountered in cohorts of three consecutive patients. Results: Thirty-eight eligible patients received therapy: 22 noninvasively staged as IV and 16 noninvasively staged as II and III.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thirty-six patients completed cycle 1, 29 patients started cycle 2, and 24 patients completed cycle 2. The combined-modality therapy was well tolerated, but DLT prevented OXP and 5-FU escalation. No grade 4 hematologic toxicity was noted.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Eleven grade 3 and two grade 4 clinical toxicities were noted in eight patients. After cycle 1, 29 patients (81%) had no cancer in the esophageal mucosa.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thirteen patients underwent an operation with intent to resect the esophagus; five patients (38%) exhibited pathologic complete responses.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: OXP 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29 administered with PI 5-FU and XRT is safe, tolerable, and seems effective against primary EC. The role of OXP in multimodality regimens against EC deserves further evaluation.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Oxaliplatin in combination with protracted-infusion fluorouracil and radiation: report of a clinical trial for patients with esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: After curative resection, the prognosis of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is poor.
randomized controlled trial	This phase III trial was designed to evaluate the benefit in overall survival (OS) of perioperative fluorouracil plus cisplatin in resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Overall, 224 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or stomach were randomly assigned to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (CS group; n = 113) or surgery alone (S group; n = 111).
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy consisted of two or three preoperative cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 consecutive days (days 1 to 5) every 28 days and three or four postoperative cycles of the same regimen.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was OS. Results: Compared with the S group, the CS group had a better OS (5-year rate 38% v 24%; hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0. 69; 95% CI, 0. 50 to 0. 95; P =.
randomized controlled trial	02); and a better disease-free survival (5-year rate: 34% v 19%; HR, 0. 65; 95% CI, 0. 48 to 0. 89; P =. 003). In the multivariable analysis, the favorable prognostic factors for survival were perioperative chemotherapy (P =.
randomized controlled trial	01) and stomach tumor localization (P <. 01). Perioperative chemotherapy significantly improved the curative resection rate (84% v 73%; P =. 04).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 38% of CS patients (mainly neutropenia) but postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: In patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, GEJ, or stomach, perioperative chemotherapy using fluorouracil plus cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection rate, disease-free survival, and OS.
randomized controlled trial	Perioperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone for resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: an FNCLCC and FFCD multicenter phase III trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Docetaxel-based chemotherapy is effective in metastatic gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	This study reports on the safety and efficacy of the docetaxel-based triplet FLOT (fluorouracil plus leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel) as a perioperative therapy for patients with locally advanced, resectable tumours.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this controlled, open-label, phase 2/3 trial, we randomly assigned 716 patients with histologically-confirmed advanced clinical stage cT2 or higher or nodal positive stage (cN+), or both, resectable tumours, with no evidence of distant metastases, via central interactive web-based-response system, to receive either three pre-operative and three postoperative 3-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 plus either 200 mg/m2 fluorouracil as continuous intravenous infusion or 1250 mg/m2 capecitabine orally on days 1 to 21 (ECF/ECX; control group) or four preoperative and four postoperative 2-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 docetaxel, 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 leucovorin and 2600 mg/m2 fluorouracil as 24-h infusion on day 1 (FLOT; experimental group).
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome of the trial was overall survival (superiority) analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01216644.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Aug 8, 2010, and Feb 10, 2015, 716 patients were randomly assigned to treatment in 38 German hospitals or with practice-based oncologists. 360 patients were assigned to ECF/ECX and 356 patients to FLOT.
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was increased in the FLOT group compared with the ECF/ECX group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·77; 95% confidence interval [CI; 0. 63 to 0·94]; median overall survival, 50 months [38·33 to not reached] vs 35 months [27·35 to 46·26]).
randomized controlled trial	The number of patients with related serious adverse events (including those occurring during hospital stay for surgery) was similar in the two groups (96 [27%] in the ECF/ECX group vs 97 [27%] in the FLOT group), as was the number of toxic deaths (two [<1%] in both groups).
randomized controlled trial	Hospitalisation for toxicity occurred in 94 patients (26%) in the ECF/ECX group and 89 patients (25%) in the FLOT group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: In locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, perioperative FLOT improved overall survival compared with perioperative ECF/ECX.

randomized controlled trial	Background: A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients).
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was overall survival. Results: ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery.
randomized controlled trial	The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died.
randomized controlled trial	As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0. 75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 60 to 0. 93; P=0. 009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs.
randomized controlled trial	23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0. 66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 53 to 0. 81; P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival.

randomized controlled trial	Perioperative chemotherapy versus surgery alone for resectable gastroesophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Combined chemoradiotherapy with and without surgery are widely accepted alternatives for the curative treatment of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm B).
randomized controlled trial	Primary outcome was overall survival time. Results: The median observation time was 6 years.
randomized controlled trial	The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P <. 05).
randomized controlled trial	Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64. 3%; 95% CI, 52. 1% to 76. 5%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40. 7%; 95% CI, 28. 9% to 52.
randomized controlled trial	5%; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2. 1; 95% CI, 1. 3 to 3. 5; P =. 003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12. 8% v 3. 5%, respectively; P =. 03).
randomized controlled trial	Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0. 30; 95% CI, 0. 19 to 0. 47; P <. 0001).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC.
randomized controlled trial	Tumor response to induction chemotherapy identifies a favorable prognostic group within these high-risk patients, regardless of the treatment group.
randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiation with and without surgery in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Uncontrolled studies suggest that chemoradiation has similar efficacy as surgery for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Therefore, a randomized trial was carried out to compare, in responders only, chemoradiation alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery in patients with locally advanced tumors.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligible patients had operable T3N0-1M0 thoracic esophageal cancer. Patients received two cycles of fluorouracil (FU) and cisplatin (days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) and either conventional (46 Gy in 4.
randomized controlled trial	5 weeks) or split-course (15 Gy, days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) concomitant radiotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with response and no contraindication to either treatment were randomly assigned to surgery (arm A) or continuation of chemoradiation (arm B; three cycles of FU/cisplatin and either conventional [20 Gy] or split-course [15 Gy] radiotherapy).
randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiation was considered equivalent to surgery if the difference in 2-year survival rate was less than 10%. Results: Of 444 eligible patients, 259 were randomly assigned; 230 patients (88. 8%) had epidermoid cancer, and 29 (11.
randomized controlled trial	2%) had glandular carcinoma. Two-year survival rate was 34% in arm A versus 40% in arm B (hazard ratio for arm B v arm A = 0. 90; adjusted P =. 44). Median survival time was 17. 7 months in arm A compared with 19. 3 months in arm B.
randomized controlled trial	Two-year local control rate was 66. 4% in arm A compared with 57. 0% in arm B, and stents were less required in the surgery arm (5% in arm A v 32% in arm B; P <. 001). The 3-month mortality rate was 9. 3% in arm A compared with 0. 8% in arm B (P =.
randomized controlled trial	002). Cumulative hospital stay was 68 days in arm A compared with 52 days in arm B (P =. 02).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Our data suggest that, in patients with locally advanced thoracic esophageal cancers, especially epidermoid, who respond to chemoradiation, there is no benefit for the addition of surgery after chemoradiation compared with the continuation of additional chemoradiation.
randomized controlled trial	Chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with chemoradiation alone in squamous cancer of the esophagus: FFCD 9102
randomized controlled trial	Background: The outlook for patients with oesophageal cancer undergoing surgical resection with curative intent is poor.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to assess the effects of preoperative chemotherapy on survival, dysphagia, and performance status in this group of patients.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: 802 previously untreated patients with resectable oesophageal cancer of any cell type were randomly allocated either two 4-day cycles, 3 weeks apart, of cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) by infusion over 4 h plus fluorouracil 1000 mg/m(2) daily by continuous infusion for 4 days followed by surgical resection (CS group, n=400), or resection alone (S group, 402).
randomized controlled trial	Clinicians could choose to give preoperative radiotherapy to all their patients irrespective of randomisation. Primary outcome measure was survival time. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: No patients dropped out of the study.
randomized controlled trial	Resection was microscopically complete in 233 (60%) of 390 assessable CS patients and 215 (54%) of 397 S patients (p<0. 0001). Postoperative complications were reported in 146 (41%) CS and 161 (42%) S patients.
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was better in the CS group (hazard ratio 0. 79; 95% CI 0. 67-0. 93; p=0. 004). Median survival was 512 days (16. 8 months) in the CS group compared with 405 days (13.
randomized controlled trial	3 months) in the S group (difference 107 days; 95% CI 30-196), and 2-year survival rates were 43% and 34% (difference 9%; 3-14).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Two cycles of preoperative cisplatin and fluorouracil improve survival without additional serious adverse events in the treatment of patients with resectable oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Surgical resection with or without preoperative chemotherapy in oesophageal cancer: a randomised controlled trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: OEO2 is a randomized, controlled trial of preoperative chemotherapy in patients undergoing radical surgery for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Random assignment was to surgery alone (S) or to two cycles of combination cisplatin and fluorouracil before surgery (CS). Initial results reported in 2002 demonstrated an advantage for both disease-free and overall survival in the CS group.
randomized controlled trial	The analysis has now been updated after a median follow-up of 6 years. Patients and methods: OEO2 recruited 802 patients, 400 on CS and 402 on S. The nature of the first recurrence event and cause of death are detailed.
randomized controlled trial	Survival has been determined from Kaplan-Meier curves and treatment comparisons made with the log-rank test. Survival by extent of resection is presented. Results: There were 655 deaths, 335 for S and 320 for CS.
randomized controlled trial	The survival benefit has been maintained with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 84 (95% CI, 0. 72 to 0. 98; P =. 03) which in absolute terms is a 5-year survival of 23. 0% for CS compared with 17. 1% for S.
randomized controlled trial	The treatment effect is consistent in both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The first disease-free survival event was macroscopic residual disease from incomplete resection (R2) or no resection in 26. 4% of the S group versus 14.
randomized controlled trial	3% of the CS P <. 001. Three-year survival by type of resection was R0 42. 4%, R1 was 18. 0%, and R2 was 8. 6%.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Long-term follow-up confirms that preoperative chemotherapy improves survival in operable esophageal cancer and should be considered as a standard of care.
randomized controlled trial	Long-term results of a randomized trial of surgery with or without preoperative chemotherapy in esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: No adjuvant treatment has been established for patients who remain at high risk for recurrence after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We conducted CheckMate 577, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial to evaluate a checkpoint inhibitor as adjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Adults with resected (R0) stage II or III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and had residual pathological disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks) or matching placebo.
randomized controlled trial	The maximum duration of the trial intervention period was 1 year. The primary end point was disease-free survival. Results: The median follow-up was 24. 4 months. Among the 532 patients who received nivolumab, the median disease-free survival was 22.
randomized controlled trial	4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 16. 6 to 34. 0), as compared with 11. 0 months (95% CI, 8. 3 to 14. 3) among the 262 patients who received placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0. 69; 96. 4% CI, 0. 56 to 0. 86; P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Disease-free survival favored nivolumab across multiple prespecified subgroups.
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to the active drug or placebo occurred in 71 of 532 patients (13%) in the nivolumab group and 15 of 260 patients (6%) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	The trial regimen was discontinued because of adverse events related to the active drug or placebo in 9% of the patients in the nivolumab group and 3% of those in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Among patients with resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, disease-free survival was significantly longer among those who received nivolumab adjuvant therapy than among those who received placebo.
randomized controlled trial	(Funded by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical; CheckMate 577 ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT02743494. ).
randomized controlled trial	Adjuvant Nivolumab in Resected Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: We evaluated capecitabine (an oral fluoropyrimidine) and oxaliplatin (a platinum compound) as alternatives to infused fluorouracil and cisplatin, respectively, for untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In a two-by-two design, we randomly assigned 1002 patients to receive triplet therapy with epirubicin and cisplatin plus either fluorouracil (ECF) or capecitabine (ECX) or triplet therapy with epirubicin and oxaliplatin plus either fluorouracil (EOF) or capecitabine (EOX).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was noninferiority in overall survival for the triplet therapies containing capecitabine as compared with fluorouracil and for those containing oxaliplatin as compared with cisplatin.
randomized controlled trial	Results: For the capecitabine-fluorouracil comparison, the hazard ratio for death in the capecitabine group was 0. 86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 80 to 0.
randomized controlled trial	99); for the oxaliplatin-cisplatin comparison, the hazard ratio for the oxaliplatin group was 0. 92 (95% CI, 0. 80 to 1. 10). The upper limit of the confidence intervals for both hazard ratios excluded the predefined noninferiority margin of 1. 23.
randomized controlled trial	Median survival times in the ECF, ECX, EOF, and EOX groups were 9. 9 months, 9. 9 months, 9. 3 months, and 11. 2 months, respectively; survival rates at 1 year were 37. 7%, 40. 8%, 40. 4%, and 46. 8%, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	In the secondary analysis, overall survival was longer with EOX than with ECF, with a hazard ratio for death of 0. 80 in the EOX group (95% CI, 0. 66 to 0. 97; P=0. 02).
randomized controlled trial	Progression-free survival and response rates did not differ significantly among the regimens. Toxic effects of capecitabine and fluorouracil were similar.
randomized controlled trial	As compared with cisplatin, oxaliplatin was associated with lower incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, alopecia, renal toxicity, and thromboembolism but with slightly higher incidences of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and neuropathy.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Capecitabine and oxaliplatin are as effective as fluorouracil and cisplatin, respectively, in patients with previously untreated esophagogastric cancer. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN51678883 [controlled-trials. com]. ).
randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine and oxaliplatin for advanced esophagogastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: In the randomized, multinational phase II/III trial (V325) of untreated advanced gastric cancer patients, the phase II part selected docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) over docetaxel and cisplatin for comparison against cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF; reference regimen) in the phase III part.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Advanced gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) plus fluorouracil 750 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (day 1) plus fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 4 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was time-to-progression (TTP). Results: In 445 randomly assigned and treated patients (DCF = 221; CF = 224), TTP was longer with DCF versus CF (32% risk reduction; log-rank P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was longer with DCF versus CF (23% risk reduction; log-rank P =. 02). Two-year survival rate was 18% with DCF and 9% with CF. Overall response rate was higher with DCF (chi2 P =. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 69% (DCF) v 59% (CF) of patients. Frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities for DCF v CF were: neutropenia (82% v 57%), stomatitis (21% v 27%), diarrhea (19% v 8%), lethargy (19% v 14%).
randomized controlled trial	Complicated neutropenia was more frequent with DCF than CF (29% v 12%). Conclusion: Adding docetaxel to CF significantly improved TTP, survival, and response rate in gastric cancer patients, but resulted in some increase in toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	Incorporation of docetaxel, as in DCF or with other active drug(s), is a new therapy option for patients with untreated advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III study of docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer: a report of the V325 Study Group
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: A phase II study was performed in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer evaluating the efficacy of a new chemotherapy schedule combining epirubicin and cisplatin with a continuous ambulatory infusion of 5-fluorouracil (ECF).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: One hundred thirty-nine consecutive, previously untreated patients were given ECF. Of these, 128 had measurable disease. Epirubicin (50 mg/m2 i. v. ) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2 i. v.
Non-randomized controlled trial	) were administered every three weeks for 8 cycles during a 21 week continuous i. v. infusion of 5-fluorouracil (200 mg/m2/day). In total 773 cycles of chemotherapy were given.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Objective tumour responses was seen in 91 (71%) of the 128 patients with measurable disease, of which 15 (12%) had a complete response.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Twenty patients with locally advanced disease responding to ECF had attempted resection of the primary--11 (55%) were completely removed, 4 of these had no residual tumour in the resected specimen. The overall median survival was 8.
Non-randomized controlled trial	2 months with 1 and 2 year survivals of 30% and 10% respectively. Grade 3 or 4 emesis occurred in 13%, stomatitis in 7%, diarrhoea in 4%, infection in 6%, leucopenia in 21% and thrombocytopenia in 8% of patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Myelosuppression delayed treatment in 39 (5%) of the 773 cycles. Six of the 139 patients (4. 3%) had treatment related deaths.
Non-randomized controlled trial	There was no measurable reduction in quality of life during chemotherapy, while 67% of the 66 patients with dysphagia had complete resolution of this symptom.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The ECF regimen displays high anti-tumour activity with moderate toxicity in patients with gastric cancer and in some cases enabled resection of previously inoperable tumours.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A phase II study in advanced gastro-esophageal cancer using epirubicin and cisplatin in combination with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (ECF)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We report the results of a prospectively randomized study that compared the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin, and protracted venous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) (ECF regimen) with the standard combination of 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) in previously untreated patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Two hundred seventy-four patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized and analyzed for survival, tumor response, toxicity, and quality of life (QL).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The overall response rate was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36% to 54%) with ECF and 21% (95% CI, 13% to 29%) with FAMTX (P =. 0002). Toxicity was tolerable and there were only three toxic deaths.
randomized controlled trial	The FAMTX regimen caused more hematologic toxicity and serious infections, but ECF caused more emesis and alopecia. The median survival duration was 8. 9 months with ECF and 5. 7 months with FAMTX (P =.
randomized controlled trial	0009); at 1 year, 36% (95% CI, 27% to 45%) of ECF and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%) of FAMTX patients were alive. The median failure-free survival duration was 7. 4 months with ECF and 3. 4 months with FAMTX (P =. 00006).
randomized controlled trial	The global QL scores were better for ECF at 24 weeks, but the remaining QL data showed no differences between either arm of the study.
randomized controlled trial	Hospital-based cost analysis on a subset of patients was similar for each arm and translated into an increment cost of $975 per life-year gained.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The ECF regimen results in a survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity, better QL and cost-effectiveness compared with FAMTX chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	This regimen should now be considered the standard treatment for advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized trial comparing epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil versus fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and methotrexate in advanced esophagogastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We report the results of a prospectively randomized study that compared the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin, and protracted venous-infusion fluorouracil (PVI 5-FU) (ECF) with the combination of mitomycin, cisplatin, and PVI 5-FU (MCF) in previously untreated patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Five hundred eighty patients with adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized to receive either ECF (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks and PVI 5-FU 200 mg/m(2)/d) or MCF (mitomycin 7 mg/m(2) every 6 weeks, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, and PVI 5-FU 300 mg/m(2)/d) and analyzed for survival, response, toxicity, and quality of life (QOL).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The overall response rate was 42. 4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37% to 48%) with ECF and 44. 1% (95% CI, 38% to 50%) with MCF (P =. 692). Toxicity was tolerable, and there were only two toxic deaths.
randomized controlled trial	ECF resulted in more grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 2 alopecia, but MCF caused more thrombocytopenia and plantar-palmar erythema. Median survival was 9. 4 months with ECF and 8. 7 months with MCF (P =. 315); at 1 year, 40.
randomized controlled trial	2% (95% CI, 34% to 46%) of ECF and 32. 7% (95% CI, 27% to 38%) of MCF patients were alive. Median failure-free survival was 7 months with both regimens. Global QOL scores were better with ECF at 3 and 6 months.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: This study confirms response, survival, and QOL benefits of ECF observed in a previous randomized study. The equivalent efficacy of MCF was demonstrated, but QOL was superior with ECF.
randomized controlled trial	ECF remains one of the reference treatments for advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Prospective randomized trial comparing mitomycin, cisplatin, and protracted venous-infusion fluorouracil (PVI 5-FU) With epirubicin, cisplatin, and PVI 5-FU in advanced esophagogastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This study was designed to compare fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction were randomly assigned to receive either fluorouracil 2,600 mg/m(2) via 24-hour infusion, leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) (FLO) every 2 weeks or fluorouracil 2,000 mg/m(2) via 24-hour infusion, leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) weekly, and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks (FLP).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Two hundred twenty patients (median age, 64 years; metastatic, 94%) were randomly assigned.
randomized controlled trial	FLO was associated with significantly less (any grade) anemia (54% v 72%), nausea (53% v 70%), vomiting (31% v 52%), alopecia (22% v 39%), fatigue (19% v 34%), renal toxicity (11% v 34%), thromboembolic events (0. 9% v 7.
randomized controlled trial	8%), and serious adverse events related to the treatment (9% v 19%). FLP was associated with significantly less peripheral neuropathy (22% v 63%). There was a trend toward improved median PFS with FLO versus FLP (5. 8 v 3. 9 months, respectively; P =.
randomized controlled trial	077) and no significant difference in median overall survival (10. 7 v 8. 8 months, respectively). However, in patients older than 65 years (n = 94), treatment with FLO resulted in significantly superior response rates (41. 3% v 16. 7%; P =.
randomized controlled trial	012), time to treatment failure (5. 4 v 2. 3 months; P <. 001), and PFS (6. 0 v 3. 1 month; P =. 029) and an improved OS (13. 9 v 7. 2 months) as compared with FLP, respectively. Conclusion: FLO reduced toxicity as compared with FLP.
randomized controlled trial	In older adult patients, FLO also seemed to be associated with improved efficacy.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III trial in metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with fluorouracil, leucovorin plus either oxaliplatin or cisplatin: a study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie
randomized controlled trial	Background: We aimed to establish the superiority (or noninferiority if superiority was not achieved) in terms of time to progression (TTP) of irinotecan/5-fluorouracil (IF) over cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (CF) in chemonaive patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach/esophagogastric junction.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients received either IF: i. v.
randomized controlled trial	irinotecan 80 mg/m(2) 30 min, folinic acid 500 mg/m(2) 2 h, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 2000 mg/m(2) 22 h, for 6/7 weeks or CF: cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) 1-3 h, with 5-FU 1000 mg/m(2)/day 24 h, days 1-5, every 4 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Results: In all, 333 patients were randomized and treated (IF 170, CF 163). Patient characteristics were balanced except more IF patients had Karnofsky performance status 100%. TTP for IF was 5. 0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3. 8-5. 8] and 4.
randomized controlled trial	2 months (95% CI 3. 7-5. 5) for CF (P = 0. 088). Overall survival (OS) was 9. 0 versus 8. 7 months, response rate 31. 8% versus 25. 8%, time to treatment failure (TTF) 4. 0 versus 3. 4 months for IF and CF, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	The difference in TTF was statistically significant (P = 0. 018). IF was better in terms of toxic deaths (0. 6% versus 3%), discontinuation for toxicity (10. 0% versus 21. 5%), severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and stomatitis, but not diarrhea.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: IF did not yield a significant TTP or OS superiority over CF, and the results of noninferiority of IF were borderline. However, IF may provide a viable, platinum-free front-line treatment alternative for metastatic gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized phase III study comparing irinotecan combined with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid to cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil in chemotherapy naive patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To compare epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatments in patients with advanced gastric or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: This open, randomized, phase III study was carried out in 71 centers.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or EGJ cancer were randomly assigned to receive either ECX as first-line treatment (ECX arm) or FOLFIRI (FOLFIRI arm).
randomized controlled trial	Second-line treatment was predefined (FOLFIRI for the ECX arm and ECX for the FOLFIRI arm). The primary criterion was time-to-treatment failure (TTF) of the first-line therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary criteria were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and quality of life. Results: In all, 416 patients were included (median age, 61. 4 years; 74% male).
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up of 31 months, median TTF was significantly longer with FOLFIRI than with ECX (5. 1 v 4. 2 months; P =. 008). There was no significant difference between the two groups in median PFS (5. 3 v 5. 8 months; P =. 96), median OS (9.
randomized controlled trial	5 v 9. 7 months; P =. 95), or response rate (39. 2% v 37. 8%). First-line FOLFIRI was better tolerated (overall rate of grade 3 to 4 toxicity, 69% v 84%; P <. 001; hematologic adverse events [AEs], 38% v 64. 5%; P <. 001; nonhematologic AEs: 53% v 53.
randomized controlled trial	5%; P =. 81). Conclusion: FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for advanced gastric and EGJ cancer demonstrated significantly better TTF than did ECX.
randomized controlled trial	Other outcome results indicate that FOLFIRI is an acceptable first-line regimen in this setting and should be explored as a backbone regimen for targeted agents.
randomized controlled trial	Prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase III study of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan versus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma: a French intergroup (Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive, Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer, and Groupe Coopérateur Multidisciplinaire en Oncologie) study
randomized controlled trial	Background: Second-line chemotherapy for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma refractory to platinum and fluoropyrimidines has not shown benefits in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether the addition of docetaxel to active symptom control alone can improve survival and HRQoL for patients. Methods: For this open-labelled, multicentre trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older from 30 UK centres.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were eligible if they had an advanced, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, or stomach that had progressed on or within 6 months of treatment with a platinum-fluoropyrimidine combination.
randomized controlled trial	Patients could have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.
randomized controlled trial	We randomly assigned patients using a central, computerised minimisation procedure to receive docetaxel plus active symptom control, or active symptom control alone (1:1; stratified by disease status, disease site, duration of response to previous chemotherapy, and performance status).
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel was given at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This is the report of the planned final analysis.
randomized controlled trial	This study is an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN13366390. Findings: Between April 21, 2008, and April 26, 2012, we recruited 168 patients, allocating 84 to each treatment group.
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up of 12 months [IQR 10-21]) and 161 (96%) deaths (80 in the docetaxel group, 81 in the active symptom control group), median overall survival in the docetaxel group was 5. 2 months (95% CI 4. 1-5. 9) versus 3. 6 months (3. 3-4.
randomized controlled trial	4) in the active symptom control group (hazard ratio 0. 67, 95% CI 0. 49-0. 92; p=0. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel was associated with higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia (12 [15%] patients vs no patients), infection (15 [19%] patients vs two [3%] patients), and febrile neutropenia (six [7%] patients vs no patients).
randomized controlled trial	Patients receiving docetaxel reported less pain (p=0. 0008) and less nausea and vomiting (p=0. 02) and constipation (p=0. 02). Global HRQoL was similar between the groups (p=0. 53).
randomized controlled trial	Disease specific HRQoL measures also showed benefits for docetaxel in reducing dysphagia (p=0. 02) and abdominal pain (p=0. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Our findings suggest that docetaxel can be recommended as an appropriate second-line treatment for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma that is refractory to treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine.

randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel versus active symptom control for refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (COUGAR-02): an open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: When designing this trial, there was no evidence that salvage chemotherapy (SLC) in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) resulted in substantial prolongation of survival when compared with best supportive care (BSC).
randomized controlled trial	However, SLC is often offered to pretreated patients with AGC for anecdotal reasons.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with AGC with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens involving both fluoropyrimidines and platinum and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 0 or 1 were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to SLC plus BSC or BSC alone.
randomized controlled trial	Choice of SLC-either docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks-was left to the discretion of investigators. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Results: Median OS was 5.
randomized controlled trial	3 months among 133 patients in the SLC arm and 3. 8 months among 69 patients in the BSC arm (hazard ratio, 0. 657; 95% CI, 0. 485 to 0. 891; one-sided P =. 007).
randomized controlled trial	OS benefit for SLC was consistent in most of the prospectively defined subgroups, including age, PS, number of prior treatments, metastatic sites, hemoglobin levels, and response to prior chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	SLC was generally well tolerated, and adverse events were similar in the SLC and BSC arms. We found no median OS difference between docetaxel and irinotecan (5. 2 v 6. 5 months; P =. 116).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest phase III trial comparing SLC plus BSC with BSC alone in AGC. In pretreated patients, SLC is tolerated and significantly improves OS when added to BSC.
randomized controlled trial	Salvage chemotherapy for pretreated gastric cancer: a randomized phase III trial comparing chemotherapy plus best supportive care with best supportive care alone
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objectives: We retrospectively assessed the combination of biweekly irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (LV) as salvage chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine (F), platinum (P), and taxane (T).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Between October 2003 and February 2006, all 131 patients with AGC were treated with irinotecan (150 mg/m(2) on day 1), along with either FOLFIRI-1 (ie, LV (20 mg/m(2) bolus) before 5-FU (1000 mg/m(2) continuous infusion over 6-hour) on days 1-2), or FOLFIRI-2 (ie, LV (20 mg/m(2) bolus) before 5-FU (400 mg/m(2) bolus) followed by 22-hour continuous infusion of 600 mg/m(2) on days 1-2), or FOLFIRI-3 (ie, 5-FU (400 mg/m(2) bolus) followed by 46-hour continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU and 100 mg/m(2) LV).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. Results: The median age of the patients was 52 years (range, 19-70 years). Patients received a median of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (range, 1-21 cycles). Of the 97 patients with measurable disease, 1 (1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	0%) achieved a complete response, and 11 (11. 3%) achieved partial responses, making the overall response rate 12. 3%. The median time to progression (TTP) was 2. 2 months (95% CI, 1. 9-2. 6 months) and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.
Non-randomized controlled trial	2 months (95% CI, 5. 6-6. 9 months). Good performance status (P = 0. 046), fewer metastatic sites (P < 0. 001), and longer time to progression of previous chemotherapy (P = 0. 006) were independent prognostic factors affecting OS.
Non-randomized controlled trial	OS was longer with the FOLFIRI-1 regimen but not with statistical significance (P = 0. 064). The treatments were generally well tolerated.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: In actual clinical practice, biweekly irinotecan with 5-FU and LV had modest activity and tolerability in AGC patients previously treated with F, P, and T.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Salvage chemotherapy with biweekly irinotecan, plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with advanced gastric cancer previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and taxane
randomized controlled trial	Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan (CPT-11) monotherapy and CPT-11 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) combination (mFOLFIRI) as second-line treatment in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A total of 59 patients were randomly assigned to either CPT-11 (150 mg/m(2) iv on day 1) or mFOLFIRI (CPT-11 150 mg/m(2) plus LV 20 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by 5-FU 2,000 mg/m(2) over 48 h), every 2 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Results: Following random assignment, 29 patients received CPT-11 and 30 patients mFOLFIRI. The ORR was 17. 2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 4-30. 9] and 20. 0 % (95 % CI 5. 6-34.
randomized controlled trial	3) for the CPT-11 and mFOLFIRI arms, respectively (P = 0. 525). There was no significant difference in median progression-free survival: 2. 2 months (95 % CI 0. 2-4. 3) for CPT-11 versus 3. 0 months (95 % CI 2. 0-3. 7) for mFOLFIRI (P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	481) or in median overall survival: 5. 8 months (95 % CI 3. 0-8. 7), compared with 6. 7 months (95 % CI 5. 3-8. 2) (P = 0. 514). Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 21 and 28 events in the CPT-11 and mFOLFIRI arms, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Although this study had a small sample size and limited statistical power, CPT-11 monotherapy and mFOLFIRI appear to be equally active and tolerable as second-line chemotherapy for AGC.
randomized controlled trial	The addition of 5-FU/LV to CPT-11 did not significantly improve efficacy.
randomized controlled trial	A randomized phase II study of biweekly irinotecan monotherapy or a combination of irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (mFOLFIRI) in patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma refractory to or progressive after first-line chemotherapy
randomized controlled trial	Background: Trifluridine/tipiracil showed activity and was well tolerated in a phase 2 study of pretreated patients with advanced gastric cancer done in Japan.
randomized controlled trial	We investigated whether the treatment was efficacious compared with placebo in a global population. Methods: TAGS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done in 110 academic hospitals in 17 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, non-resectable, metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction) as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification (7th edition) who had received at least two previous chemotherapy regimens and had experienced radiological disease progression were eligible for inclusion.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via dynamic randomisation from a centralised interactive voice-response system to receive either oral trifluridine/tipiracil (35 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-5 and days 8-12 every 28 days) plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care.
randomized controlled trial	Participants were allocated to groups by study-site personnel. Randomisation was stratified by region (Japan vs rest of world), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), and previous treatment with ramucirumab (yes vs no).
randomized controlled trial	Both patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02500043. The trial, including follow-up of all participants, has been completed.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Feb 24, 2016, and Jan 5, 2018, 507 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 337 to the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 170 to the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·8-6·2) in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 3·6 months (3·1-4·1) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·69 [95% CI 0·56-0·85]; one-sided p=0·00029, two-sided p=0·00058).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause occurred in 267 (80%) patients in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 97 (58%) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause were neutropenia (n=114 [34%]) and anaemia (n=64 [19%]) in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and abdominal pain (n=15 [9%]) and general deterioration of physical health (n=15 [9%]) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	Serious adverse events of any cause were reported in 143 (43%) patients in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and 70 (42%) in the placebo group.
randomized controlled trial	One treatment-related death was reported in each group (because of cardiopulmonary arrest in the trifluridine/tipiracil group and because of toxic hepatitis in the placebo group).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Trifluridine/tipiracil significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo and was well tolerated in this heavily pretreated population of patients with advanced gastric cancer.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The phase III ToGA trial established cisplatin, fluoropyrimidine and trastuzumab as the standard treatment in HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, as demonstrated in HER2-negative AGC, oxaliplatin-based regimens could improve tolerance remaining effective.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The aim of this trial was to explore the potential activity and safety of capecitabine, oxaliplatin (XELOX) and trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: We conducted a multicentre, prospective, non-randomised, non-controlled, open-label and national (Spanish) phase II study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (EGJ) cancer received XELOX and trastuzumab as first-line treatment. Primary endpoint was objective tumour response rate (ORR).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: 45 patients from ten hospitals in Spain were included from September 2011 to December 2013. Median age was 65 years, 82. 2% were male, 69% had gastric cancer and 31% had EGJ tumours. At a median follow-up of 13. 7 months (7. 1-20.
Non-randomized controlled trial	9), the estimated median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7. 1 (95% CI 5. 5-8. 7) and 13. 8 months (95% CI 10. 1-17. 4), respectively, with 8. 9%, 37. 8% and 31.
Non-randomized controlled trial	1% of patients achieving complete response, partial response and stable disease. Regarding safety, 44. 4% of the patients had grade 3 or greater adverse events, being the most frequent diarrhoea (26. 6%), fatigue (15.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5%), nausea (20%) and vomiting (13. 3%). Only two patients (4. 4%) developed asymptomatic grade 2 left ventricle ejection fraction reduction.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: XELOX-trastuzumab is a promising and effective therapy as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-positive AGC, with comparable results to the ones obtained with other "platinum-based" regimens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This scheme is feasible and tolerable with a low incidence of cardiac toxicity.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of Trastuzumab in combination with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer: HERXO trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor.
randomized controlled trial	The drug may have efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan as compared with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed while they were receiving at least two previous therapies, including trastuzumab, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.
randomized controlled trial	4 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary end points included overall survival, response duration, progression-free survival, confirmed response (response persisting ≥4 weeks), and safety.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 187 treated patients, 125 received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 62 chemotherapy (55 received irinotecan and 7 paclitaxel).
randomized controlled trial	An objective response was reported in 51% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group, as compared with 14% of those in the physician's choice group (P<0. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan than with chemotherapy (median, 12. 5 vs. 8. 4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0. 59; 95% confidence interval, 0. 39 to 0. 88; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	01, which crossed the prespecified O'Brien-Fleming boundary [0. 0202 on the basis of number of deaths]).
randomized controlled trial	The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 51% of the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 24% of the physician's choice group), anemia (38% and 23%, respectively), and decreased white-cell count (21% and 11%).
randomized controlled trial	A total of 12 patients had trastuzumab deruxtecan-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (grade 1 or 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 or 4 in 3), as adjudicated by an independent committee.
randomized controlled trial	One drug-related death (due to pneumonia) was noted in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group; no drug-related deaths occurred in the physician's choice group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan led to significant improvements in response and overall survival, as compared with standard therapies, among patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Myelosuppression and interstitial lung disease were the notable toxic effects. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo; DESTINY-Gastric01 ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT03329690. ).

randomized controlled trial	Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-mediated signalling and angiogenesis can contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to assess whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, prolonged survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial between Oct 6, 2009, and Jan 26, 2012, at 119 centres in 29 countries in North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 24-87 years with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression after first-line platinum-containing or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy were randomly assigned (2:1), via a central interactive voice-response system, to receive best supportive care plus either ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo, intravenously once every 2 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00917384.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 355 patients were assigned to receive ramucirumab (n=238) or placebo (n=117).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 5·2 months (IQR 2·3-9·9) in patients in the ramucirumab group and 3·8 months (1·7-7·1) in those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·776, 95% CI 0·603-0·998; p=0·047).
randomized controlled trial	The survival benefit with ramucirumab remained unchanged after multivariable adjustment for other prognostic factors (multivariable HR 0·774, 0·605-0·991; p=0·042).
randomized controlled trial	Rates of hypertension were higher in the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group (38 [16%] vs nine [8%]), whereas rates of other adverse events were mostly similar between groups (223 [94%] vs 101 [88%]).
randomized controlled trial	Five (2%) deaths in the ramucirumab group and two (2%) in the placebo group were considered to be related to study drug.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Ramucirumab is the first biological treatment given as a single drug that has survival benefits in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma progressing after first-line chemotherapy.

randomized controlled trial	Ramucirumab monotherapy for previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (REGARD): an international, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: VEGFR-2 has a role in gastric cancer pathogenesis and progression.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, in combination with paclitaxel would increase overall survival in patients previously treated for advanced gastric cancer compared with placebo plus paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial was done at 170 centres in 27 countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression on or within 4 months after first-line chemotherapy (platinum plus fluoropyrimidine with or without an anthracycline) were randomly assigned with a centralised interactive voice or web-response system in a 1:1 ratio to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously on days 1 and 15, plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.
randomized controlled trial	A permuted block randomisation, stratified by geographic region, time to progression on first-line therapy, and disease measurability, was used. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and safety analysis included all patients who received at least one treatment with study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.
randomized controlled trial	gov, number NCT01170663, and has been completed; patients who are still receiving treatment are in the extension phase.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Dec 23, 2010, and Sept 23, 2012, 665 patients were randomly assigned to treatment-330 to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel and 335 to placebo plus paclitaxel.
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group than in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (median 9·6 months [95% CI 8·5-10·8] vs 7·4 months [95% CI 6·3-8·4], hazard ratio 0·807 [95% CI 0·678-0·962]; p=0·017).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in more than 5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group versus placebo plus paclitaxel included neutropenia (133 [41%] of 327 vs 62 [19%] of 329), leucopenia (57 [17%] vs 22 [7%]), hypertension (46 [14%] vs eight [2%]), fatigue (39 [12%] vs 18 [5%]), anaemia (30 [9%] vs 34 [10%]), and abdominal pain (20 [6%] vs 11 [3%]).
randomized controlled trial	The incidence of grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia was low in both groups (ten [3%] vs eight [2%]).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: The combination of ramucirumab with paclitaxel significantly increases overall survival compared with placebo plus paclitaxel, and could be regarded as a new standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (RAINBOW): a double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: First-line chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has a median overall survival (OS) of less than 1 year.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to evaluate first-line programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor-based therapies in gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. We report the first results for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (CheckMate 649), we enrolled adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated, unresectable, non-HER2-positive gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 29 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1 while all three groups were open) via interactive web response technology (block sizes of six) to nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks or 240 mg every 2 weeks) plus chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks or leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin every 2 weeks), nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or chemotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Primary endpoints for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were OS or progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review, in patients whose tumours had a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of five or more.
randomized controlled trial	Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT02872116.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: From March 27, 2017, to April 24, 2019, of 2687 patients assessed for eligibility, we concurrently randomly assigned 1581 patients to treatment (nivolumab plus chemotherapy [n=789, 50%] or chemotherapy alone [n=792, 50%]).
randomized controlled trial	The median follow-up for OS was 13·1 months (IQR 6·7-19·1) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 11·1 months (5·8-16·1) for chemotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [98·4% CI 0·59-0·86]; p<0·0001) and PFS (HR 0·68 [98 % CI 0·56-0·81]; p<0·0001) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of five or more (minimum follow-up 12·1 months).
randomized controlled trial	Additional results showed significant improvement in OS, along with PFS benefit, in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of one or more and all randomly assigned patients.
randomized controlled trial	Among all treated patients, 462 (59%) of 782 patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 341 (44%) of 767 patients in the chemotherapy alone group had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events.
randomized controlled trial	The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (≥25%) were nausea, diarrhoea, and peripheral neuropathy across both groups.
randomized controlled trial	16 (2%) deaths in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and four (1%) deaths in the chemotherapy alone group were considered to be treatment-related. No new safety signals were identified.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Nivolumab is the first PD-1 inhibitor to show superior OS, along with PFS benefit and an acceptable safety profile, in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

randomized controlled trial	We report the final analysis from our study of the immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (ATTRACTION-3) at 90 hospitals and cancer centres in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA.
randomized controlled trial	We enrolled patients aged 20 years and older with unresectable advanced or recurrent oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.
randomized controlled trial	1, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and who were refractory or intolerant to one previous fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab (240 mg for 30 min every 2 weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given intravenously.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1. 1 or unacceptable toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients.
randomized controlled trial	Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02569242, and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	At the time of data cutoff on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 4·5-19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6-15·2) in the chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 10·9 months, 95% CI 9·2-13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·2-9·9; hazard ratio for death 0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·019).
randomized controlled trial	38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [2%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	Five deaths were deemed treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one each of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one each of pneumonia, spinal cord abscess, and interstitial lung disease).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survivaland a favourable safety profile compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and might represent a new standard second-line treatment option for these patients.

randomized controlled trial	1, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, plus 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (chemotherapy), once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, histology, and performance status. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to group assignment and PD-L1 biomarker status.
randomized controlled trial	Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more, and overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and in all randomised patients.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT03189719, and is closed to recruitment.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between July 25, 2017, and June 3, 2019, 1020 patients were screened and 749 were enrolled and randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=373 [50%]) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=376 [50%]).
randomized controlled trial	At the first interim analysis (median follow-up of 22·6 months), pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was superior to placebo plus chemotherapy for overall survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (median 13·9 months vs 8·8 months; hazard ratio 0·57 [95% CI 0·43-0·75]; p<0·0001), oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (12·6 months vs 9·8 months; 0·72 [0·60-0·88]; p=0·0006), PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (13·5 months vs 9·4 months; 0·62 [0·49-0·78]; p<0·0001), and in all randomised patients (12·4 months vs 9·8 months; 0·73 [0·62-0·86]; p<0·0001).
randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was superior to placebo plus chemotherapy for progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (6·3 months vs 5·8 months; 0·65 [0·54-0·78]; p<0·0001), PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (7·5 months vs 5·5 months; 0·51 [0·41-0·65]; p<0·0001), and in all randomised patients (6·3 months vs 5·8 months; 0·65 [0·55-0·76]; p<0·0001).
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 266 (72%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 250 (68%) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy improved overall survival in patients with previously untreated, advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and in all randomised patients regardless of histology, and had a manageable safety profile in the total as-treated population.

randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for first-line treatment of advanced oesophageal cancer (KEYNOTE-590): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Patients with advanced esophageal cancer have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options after first-line chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In this open-label, phase III study, we randomly assigned (1:1) 628 patients with advanced/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, that progressed after one prior therapy, to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or chemotherapy (investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan).
randomized controlled trial	Primary end points were overall survival (OS) in patients with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10, in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and in all patients (one-sided α 0. 9%, 0. 8%, and 0. 8%, respectively).
randomized controlled trial	Results: At final analysis, conducted 16 months after the last patient was randomly assigned, OS was prolonged with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for patients with CPS ≥ 10 (median, 9. 3 v 6. 7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 69 [95% CI, 0. 52 to 0.
randomized controlled trial	93]; P =. 0074). Estimated 12-month OS rate was 43% (95% CI, 33. 5% to 52. 1%) with pembrolizumab versus 20% (95% CI, 13. 5% to 28. 3%) with chemotherapy. Median OS was 8. 2 months versus 7. 1 months (HR, 0. 78 [95% CI, 0. 63 to 0. 96]; P =.
randomized controlled trial	0095) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 7. 1 months versus 7. 1 months (HR, 0. 89 [95% CI, 0. 75 to 1. 05]; P =. 0560) in all patients. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18. 2% of patients with pembrolizumab versus 40.
randomized controlled trial	9% in those who underwent chemotherapy. Conclusion: Pembrolizumab prolonged OS versus chemotherapy as second-line therapy for advanced esophageal cancer in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized Phase III KEYNOTE-181 Study of Pembrolizumab Versus Chemotherapy in Advanced Esophageal Cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Somatic mutations have the potential to encode "non-self" immunogenic antigens. We hypothesized that tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: The immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2. 2 and 5.
Non-randomized controlled trial	0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0. 10 [P<0. 001], and hazard ratio for death, 0. 22 [P=0. 05]).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67% [4 of 6 patients]).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0. 02). Conclusions: This study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.

Non-randomized controlled trial	PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency
Non-randomized controlled trial	The genomes of cancers deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic mutations.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).
Non-randomized controlled trial	We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor.
Non-randomized controlled trial	These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
randomized controlled trial	Importance: Standard first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma is chemotherapy, but the prognosis remains poor.
randomized controlled trial	Camrelizumab (an anti-programmed death receptor 1 [PD-1] antibody) showed antitumor activity in previously treated advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial (ESCORT-1st study) enrolled patients from 60 hospitals in China between December 3, 2018, and May 12, 2020 (final follow-up, October 30, 2020).
randomized controlled trial	A total of 751 patients were screened and 596 eligible patients with untreated advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were randomized.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg (n = 298) or placebo (n = 298), combined with up to 6 cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2). All treatments were given intravenously every 3 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: Coprimary end points were overall survival (significance threshold, 1-sided P <. 02) and progression-free survival (significance threshold, 1-sided P <. 005).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 596 patients randomized (median age, 62 years [interquartile range, 56-67 years]; 523 men [87. 8%]), 1 patient in the placebo-chemotherapy group did not receive planned treatment. A total of 490 patients (82.
randomized controlled trial	2%) had discontinued the study treatment. The median follow-up was 10. 8 months. The overall survival for the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group was a median of 15. 3 months (95% CI, 12. 8-17. 3; 135 deaths) vs a median of 12. 0 months (95% CI, 11. 0-13.
randomized controlled trial	3; 174 deaths) for the placebo-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0. 70 [95% CI, 0. 56-0. 88]; 1-sided P =. 001). Progression-free survival for camrelizumab plus chemotherapy was a median of 6. 9 months (95% CI, 5. 8-7.
randomized controlled trial	4; 199 progression or deaths) vs 5. 6 months (95% CI, 5. 5-5. 7; 229 progression or deaths) for the placebo-chemotherapy group (HR for progression or death, 0. 56 [95% CI, 0. 46-0. 68]; 1-sided P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 189 patients (63. 4%) in the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group and 201 (67. 7%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including treatment-related deaths among 9 patients (3.
randomized controlled trial	0%) and 11 patients (3. 7%), respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the addition of camrelizumab to chemotherapy, compared with placebo and chemotherapy, significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival.

randomized controlled trial	Effect of Camrelizumab vs Placebo Added to Chemotherapy on Survival and Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The ESCORT-1st Randomized Clinical Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: The optimal perioperative chemotherapeutic regimen for locally advanced gastric cancer remains undefined.
randomized controlled trial	We evaluated the efficacy and safety of perioperative and postoperative S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) compared with postoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapOx) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer undergoing D2 gastrectomy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did this open-label, phase 3, superiority and non-inferiority, randomised trial at 27 hospitals in China.
randomized controlled trial	We recruited antitumour treatment-naive patients aged 18 years or older with historically confirmed cT4a N+ M0 or cT4b Nany M0 gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, with Karnofsky performance score of 70 or more.
randomized controlled trial	Patients undergoing D2 gastrectomy were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive web response system, stratified by participating centres and Lauren classification, to receive adjuvant CapOx (eight postoperative cycles of intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day one of each 21 day cycle plus oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice a day), adjuvant SOX (eight postoperative cycles of intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day one of each 21 day cycle plus oral S-1 40-60 mg twice a day), or perioperative SOX (intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day one of each 21 day plus oral S-1 40-60 mg twice a day for three cycles preoperatively and five cycles postoperatively followed by three cycles of S-1 monotherapy).
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, 3-year disease-free survival to assess the superiority of perioperative-SOX compared with adjuvant-SOX and the non-inferiority (hazard ratio non-inferiority margin of 1·33) of adjuvant-SOX compared with adjuvant-CapOx.
randomized controlled trial	Safety analysis were done in patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT01534546.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Aug 15, 2012, and Feb 28, 2017, 1094 patients were screened and 1022 (93%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, of whom 345 (34%) patients were assigned to the adjuvant-CapOx, 340 (33%) patients to the adjuvant-SOX group, and 337 (33%) patients to the perioperative-SOX group.
randomized controlled trial	3-year disease-free survival was 51·1% (95% CI 45·5-56·3) in the adjuvant-CapOx group, 56·5% (51·0-61·7) in the adjuvant-SOX group, and 59·4% (53·8-64·6) in the perioperative-SOX group.
randomized controlled trial	The hazard ratio (HR) was 0·77 (95% CI 0·61-0·97; Wald p=0·028) for the perioperative-SOX group compared with the adjuvant-CapOx group and 0·86 (0·68-1·07; Wald p=0·17) for the adjuvant-SOX group compared with the adjuvant-CapOx group.
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3-4 adverse events was neutropenia (32 [12%] of 258 patients in the adjuvant-CapOx group, 21 [8%] of 249 patients in the adjuvant-SOX group, and 30 [10%] of 310 patients in the perioperative-SOX group).
randomized controlled trial	Serious adverse events were reported in seven (3%) of 258 patients in adjuvant-CapOx group, two of which were related to treatment; eight (3%) of 249 patients in adjuvant-SOX group, two of which were related to treatment; and seven (2%) of 310 patients in perioperative-SOX group, four of which were related to treatment.
randomized controlled trial	No treatment-related deaths were reported.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Perioperative-SOX showed a clinically meaningful improvement compared with adjuvant-CapOx in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer who had D2 gastrectomy; adjuvant-SOX was non-inferior to adjuvant-CapOx in these patients.
randomized controlled trial	Perioperative-SOX could be considered a new treatment option for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Importance: Most older patients with esophageal cancer cannot complete the standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). An effective and tolerable chemoradiotherapy regimen for older patients is needed.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and toxic effects of CCRT with S-1 vs radiotherapy (RT) alone in older patients with esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: A randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 23 Chinese centers between June 1, 2016, and August 31, 2018. The study enrolled 298 patients aged 70 to 85 years.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible participants had histologically confirmed esophageal cancer, stage IB to IVB disease based on the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (stage IVB: only metastasis to the supraclavicular/celiac lymph nodes) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1.
randomized controlled trial	Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2020, to March 10, 2021. Interventions: Patients were stratified according to age (<80 vs ≥80 years) and tumor length (<5 vs ≥5 cm) and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either CCRT with S-1 or RT alone.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was the 2-year overall survival rate using intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Of the 298 patients enrolled, 180 (60. 4%) were men.
randomized controlled trial	The median age was 77 (interquartile range, 74-79) years in the CCRT group and 77 (interquartile range, 74-80) years in the RT alone group. A total of 151 patients (50. 7%) had stage III or IV disease.
randomized controlled trial	The CCRT group had a significantly higher complete response rate than the RT group (41. 6% vs 26. 8%; P =. 007). Surviving patients had a median follow-up of 33. 9 months (interquartile range: 28. 5-38.
randomized controlled trial	2 months), and the CCRT group had a significantly higher 2-year overall survival rate (53. 2% vs 35. 8%; hazard ratio, 0. 63; 95% CI, 0. 47-0. 85; P =. 002).
randomized controlled trial	There were no significant differences in the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxic effects between the CCRT and RT groups except that grade 3 or higher leukopenia occurred in more patients in the CCRT group (9. 5% vs 2. 7%; P =. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related deaths were observed in 3 patients (2. 0%) in the CCRT group and 4 patients (2. 7%) in the RT group.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions and relevance: In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, CCRT with S-1 was tolerable and provided significant benefits over RT alone in older patients with esophageal cancer. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.

randomized controlled trial	Efficacy of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With S-1 vs Radiotherapy Alone for Older Patients With Esophageal Cancer: A Multicenter Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: The standard curative treatment for patients with esophageal cancer is perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by open transthoracic esophagectomy (OTE).
randomized controlled trial	Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy (RAMIE) may reduce complications.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted, assigning 112 patients with resectable intrathoracic esophageal cancer to either RAMIE or OTE.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of overall surgery-related postoperative complications (modified Clavien-Dindo classification grade 2-5).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Overall surgery-related postoperative complications occurred less frequently after RAMIE (59%) compared to OTE (80%) [risk ratio with RAMIE (RR) 0. 74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0. 57-0. 96; P = 0. 02].
randomized controlled trial	RAMIE resulted in less median blood loss (400 vs 568 mL, P <0. 001), a lower percentage of pulmonary complications (RR 0. 54; 95% CI, 0. 34-0. 85; P = 0. 005) and cardiac complications (RR 0. 47; 95% CI, 0. 27-0. 83; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	006) and lower mean postoperative pain (visual analog scale, 1. 86 vs 2. 62; P < 0. 001) compared to OTE. Functional recovery at postoperative day 14 was better in the RAMIE group [RR 1. 48 (95% CI, 1. 03-2. 13; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	038)] with better quality of life score at discharge [mean difference quality of life score 13. 4 (2. 0-24. 7, p = 0. 02)] and 6 weeks postdischarge [mean difference 11. 1 quality of life score (1. 0-21. 1; P = 0. 03)].
randomized controlled trial	Short- and long-term oncological outcomes were comparable at a medium follow-up of 40 months.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: RAMIE resulted in a lower percentage of overall surgery-related and cardiopulmonary complications with lower postoperative pain, better short-term quality of life, and a better short-term postoperative functional recovery compared to OTE.
randomized controlled trial	Oncological outcomes were comparable and in concordance with the highest standards nowadays.
randomized controlled trial	Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Thoracolaparoscopic Esophagectomy Versus Open Transthoracic Esophagectomy for Resectable Esophageal Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial
randomized controlled trial	Initial results of the ROBOT, which randomized between robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) and open transthoracic esophagectomy (OTE), showed significantly better short-term postoperative outcomes in favor of RAMIE.
randomized controlled trial	However, it is not yet clarified if RAMIE is equivalent to OTE regarding long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to report the long-term oncological results of the ROBOT trial in terms of survival and disease-free survival.
randomized controlled trial	This study is a follow-up study of the ROBOT trial, which was a randomized controlled trial comparing RAMIE to OTE in 112 patients with intrathoracic esophageal cancer. Both the trial protocol and short-term results were previously published.
randomized controlled trial	The primary outcome of the current study was 5-year overall survival. Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival and recurrence patterns. Analysis was by intention to treat.
randomized controlled trial	During the recruitment period, 109 patients were included in the survival analysis (RAMIE n = 54, OTE n = 55). Majority of patients had clinical stage III or IV (RAMIE 63%, OTE 55%) and received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (80%).
randomized controlled trial	Median follow-up was 60 months (range 31-60). The combined 5-year overall survival rates for RAMIE and OTE were 41% (95% CI 27-55) and 40% (95% CI 26-53), respectively (log rank test P = 0. 827).
randomized controlled trial	The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 42% (95% CI 28-55) in the RAMIE group and 43% (95% CI 29-57) in the OTE group (log rank test P = 0. 749).
randomized controlled trial	Out of 104 patients, 57 (55%) developed recurrent disease detected at a median of 10 months (range 0-56) after surgery. No statistically difference in recurrence rate nor recurrence pattern was observed between both groups.
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival and disease-free survival of RAMIE are comparable to OTE. These results continue to support the use of robotic surgery for esophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy versus open esophagectomy: long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Patterns of disease recurrence in patients with oesophageal cancer following treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery (nCRTS) or surgery alone are poorly reported.
randomized controlled trial	An understanding of patterns of disease recurrence is important for subsequent treatment planning.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: An analysis was undertaken of patterns of disease recurrence from a phase III multicentre randomized trial (FFCD9901) comparing nCRTS with surgery alone in patients with stage I and II oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Some 170 patients undergoing surgical resection were included in the study. R0 resection rates were similar in the two groups: 94 per cent following nCRTS versus 92 per cent after surgery alone (P = 0·749).
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up of 94·2 months, recurrent disease was found in 39·4 per cent of the overall cohort (31 per cent after nCRTS versus 47 per cent following surgery alone; P = 0·030).
randomized controlled trial	Locoregional recurrence was diagnosed in 41 patients (17 versus 30 per cent respectively; P = 0·047) and distant metastatic recurrence in 47 (23 versus 31 per cent respectively; P = 0·244).
randomized controlled trial	Metastatic recurrence was more frequent in patients with adenocarcinoma than in those with squamous cell cancer (40 versus 23·1 per cent respectively; P = 0·032).
randomized controlled trial	ypT0 N0 category was associated with prolonged time to mixed locoregional and metastatic recurrence (P = 0·009), and time to locoregional (P = 0·044) and metastatic (P = 0·055) recurrence.
randomized controlled trial	In multivariable analysis, node-positive disease predicted both locoregional (P = 0·001) and metastatic (P < 0·001) recurrence.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Locoregional disease control following nCRTS indicated a local field effect not related solely to completeness of resection. pN+ disease was strongly predictive of time to locoregional and metastatic disease recurrence.

meta analysis	Background: Previous studies that showed an association between smoking and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction were limited in their ability to assess differences by tumor site, sex, dose-response, and duration of cigarette smoking cessation.
meta analysis	Methods: We used primary data from 10 population-based case-control studies and two cohort studies from the Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium. Analyses were restricted to white non-Hispanic men and women.
meta analysis	Patients were classified as having esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 1540), esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (n = 1450), or a combination of both (all adenocarcinoma; n = 2990). Control subjects (n = 9453) were population based.
meta analysis	Associations between pack-years of cigarette smoking and risks of adenocarcinomas were assessed, as well as their potential modification by sex and duration of smoking cessation.
meta analysis	Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) estimated using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, education, and gastroesophageal reflux, were pooled using a meta-analytic methodology to generate summary odds ratios.
meta analysis	All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The summary odds ratios demonstrated strong associations between cigarette smoking and esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1. 96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1. 64 to 2.
meta analysis	34), esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (OR = 2. 18, 95% CI = 1. 84 to 2. 58), and all adenocarcinoma (OR = 2. 08, 95% CI = 1. 83 to 2. 37).
meta analysis	In addition, there was a strong dose-response association between pack-years of cigarette smoking and each outcome (P <. 001).
meta analysis	Compared with current smokers, longer smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all adenocarcinoma after adjusting for pack-years (<10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0. 82, 95% CI = 0. 60 to 1.
meta analysis	13; and > or =10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0. 71, 95% CI = 0. 56 to 0. 89). Sex-specific summary odds ratios were similar.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in white men and women; compared with current smoking, smoking cessation was associated with reduced risks.

meta analysis	Reasons for the rising annual incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) remain uncertain.
meta analysis	Previous studies have given conflicting results, but some have suggested that drugs which relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) may increase the risk of EAC.
meta analysis	This study is to determine systematically the risk of EAC associated with individual medications which relax the LES and compare risks with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA).
meta analysis	Relevant published studies were identified by systematic searching PubMed for case-control studies reporting on risk of EAC, ESCC or GCA with use of medications known to reduce LES pressure.
meta analysis	Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each malignancy. Data were analyzed from four case-control studies involving 9,412 participants. EAC was significantly associated with theophylline use (OR 1. 55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1. 05-2.
meta analysis	28; P= 0. 03, I(2) = 0%) and anticholinergic medications (OR 1. 66, 95% CI 1. 13-2. 44; P= 0. 01, I(2) = 84%). This effect was not observed in cases of ESCC or GCA.
meta analysis	Other drug groups including calcium channel modulators and nitrates did not increase the risk of EAC. An inverse relationship was observed between ESCC and nitrates and between GCA and benzodiazepines.
meta analysis	The lack of increased EAC risk with many commonly used medications is reassuring. However, a significant correlation was found between EAC and the use of anticholinergics and theophyllines.
meta analysis	This may reflect common causality between obstructive lung disease and EAC, and further studies to explore these relationships are warranted.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis: risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma with medications which relax the lower esophageal sphincter
meta analysis	Background and aim: A large number of papers reporting the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and esophageal cancer (EC) risk have been published in the past few decades; however, these results are inconsistent.
meta analysis	Therefore, we carried out meta-analyses to explore the relationships between BMI and the risk of EC (including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC] and esophageal adenocarcinoma [EADC]).
meta analysis	Methods: We used the Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase to identify all published/online articles before December 30, 2018, which yielded 25 articles eligible for data extraction (including 16,561 cases and 11,954,161 controls), and then pooled the relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects model.
meta analysis	Results: Our study presented that underweight had statistically significant association with the risk of EC (RR = 1. 78, 95% CI = 1. 48, 2. 14, P < 0. 001) and ESCC (RR = 1. 57, 95% CI = 1. 20, 2. 06, P = 0. 001) when compared with normal weight.
meta analysis	Interestingly, both overweight and obesity could increase the risk of EADC (RR = 1. 56, 95% CI = 1. 42, 1. 71, P < 0. 001; RR = 2. 34, 95% CI = 2. 02, 2. 70, P < 0. 001) while decrease the risk of ESCC (RR = 0. 71, 95% CI = 0. 60, 0. 84, P < 0.
meta analysis	001; RR = 0. 63, 95% CI = 0. 60, 0. 84, P = 0. 002). Additionally, obesity could increase the risk of EC (RR = 1. 51, 95% CI = 1. 21, 1. 89, P < 0. 001).
meta analysis	Conclusion: These meta-analyses provide a comprehensive and updated epidemiological evidence to confirm the associations between BMI and EC risk.
meta analysis	These findings have public health implications with respect to better control bodyweight and then reduce the occurrence of EC (including ESCC and EADC).
meta analysis	Cumulative evidence for the relationship between body mass index and the risk of esophageal cancer: An updated meta-analysis with evidence from 25 observational studies
meta analysis	Objective: This systematic review aimed to explore the potential association between dietary cholesterol intake and esophageal cancer risk.
meta analysis	Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to March 2019 according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.
meta analysis	Pooled estimates with odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using random effects models. Results: Nine articles of 12 independent studies were included in the final meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Pooled analysis suggested that dietary cholesterol intake may increase the risk of esophageal cancer (summarized OR = 1. 424, 95% CI = 1. 191–1. 704). Consistent results were found in American (summarized OR = 1. 410, 95% CI = 1. 130–1.
meta analysis	758) and European populations (summarized OR = 1. 556, 95% CI = 1. 021–2. 373).
meta analysis	Subgroup analysis by disease type showed that dietary cholesterol intake had a significant association with the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
meta analysis	Conclusion: Our findings indicated that dietary cholesterol intake could significantly increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer in both European and American populations.
meta analysis	Further high-quality studies are necessary to confirm the effects of cholesterol intake.
meta analysis	Effect of dietary cholesterol intake on the risk of esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Alcohol is a risk factor for cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, colorectum, liver, larynx and female breast, whereas its impact on other cancers remains controversial.
meta analysis	Methods: We investigated the effect of alcohol on 23 cancer types through a meta-analytic approach. We used dose-response meta-regression models and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity.
meta analysis	Results: A total of 572 studies, including 486 538 cancer cases, were identified. Relative risks (RRs) for heavy drinkers compared with nondrinkers and occasional drinkers were 5. 13 for oral and pharyngeal cancer, 4.
meta analysis	95 for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 1. 44 for colorectal, 2. 65 for laryngeal and 1. 61 for breast cancer; for those neoplasms there was a clear dose-risk relationship.
meta analysis	Heavy drinkers also had a significantly higher risk of cancer of the stomach (RR 1. 21), liver (2. 07), gallbladder (2. 64), pancreas (1. 19) and lung (1. 15).
meta analysis	There was indication of a positive association between alcohol consumption and risk of melanoma and prostate cancer. Alcohol consumption and risk of Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were inversely associated.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Alcohol increases risk of cancer of oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, colorectum, liver, larynx and female breast.
meta analysis	There is accumulating evidence that alcohol drinking is associated with some other cancers such as pancreas and prostate cancer and melanoma.
meta analysis	Alcohol consumption and site-specific cancer risk: a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis
meta analysis	Cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking are two major risk factors for esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Not all, but several of case-control studies have indicated interaction between the two factors; however, no prospective study has validated this phenomenon to date.
meta analysis	Therefore, the interaction between smoking and alcohol drinking is still open-ended question. To answer this, we conducted a pooled analysis using large-scale population-based cohort studies in Japan.
meta analysis	Male subjects from eight cohort studies were included. Cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were both categorized categorically (never/ever), and in the three consumption levels of pack years and ethanol consumption/day.
meta analysis	Effects of smoking and drinking in each study were estimated by Cox regression models.
meta analysis	The study-specific results were combined through meta-analysis to obtain summary effects of hazard ratios (HRs) and measures of interactions at both additive and multiplicative scales.
meta analysis	Population attributable fractions (PAFs) from smoking and drinking were obtained using distributions of exposures and fully adjusted HRs. In 162 826 male subjects, 954 esophageal cancer incidences were identified.
meta analysis	HRs of ever smoking, ever drinking, and their combination were 2. 92 (1. 59-5. 36), 2. 73 (1. 78-4. 18), and 8. 86 (4. 82-16. 30), respectively.
meta analysis	Interaction between cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking was significantly positive on the additive scale, but not significant on the multiplicative scale.
meta analysis	The joint effect of smoking and drinking in three levels of evaluation showed a similar significant super-additive interaction. PAFs from smoking, drinking, and their combination were 55. 4%, 61. 2%, and 81. 4%, respectively.
meta analysis	Cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking had a significant positive additive interaction for esophageal cancer risk.
meta analysis	Revisit of an unanswered question by pooled analysis of eight cohort studies in Japan: Does cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking have interaction for the risk of esophageal cancer?
meta analysis	Background: Esophageal cancer is a common and aggressive malignant tumor.
meta analysis	This study aimed to investigate the association between human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 16 and 18 and esophageal carcinoma (EC) in the world population by conducting a meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Materials and methods: Computerized bibliographic and manual searches were performed to identify all eligible literatures between 1982 and 2014. PUBMED (http://www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/) and CNKI (http://www. cnki.
meta analysis	net/) were the primary sources of case-control studies, and key words used include human papillomavirus, HPV, esophageal, esophagus, cancer, carcinoma, and tumor.
meta analysis	All searches were performed by reviewing articles and abstracts cited in the published systematic reviews and case-control studies.
meta analysis	Prospective studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs for the association between HPV and EC were included.
meta analysis	Results: Thirty-three randomized studies were identified, and the main features of these trials were included in this systematic review. HPV infection rate in the EC group was 46. 5%, while HPV infection rate in the control group was 26. 2% (OR = 1.
meta analysis	62; 95% CI, 1. 33-1. 98). In China, the merger OR value was 1. 62 (95% CI: 1. 26-2. 07); while in the Asian region, the merger OR value was 1. 63 (95% CI: 1. 29-2. 04).
meta analysis	There were statistical differences in HPV testing due to different detection methods such as PCR, IHC and ISH. In the PCR detection group, the merger OR value was 1. 61 (95% CI: 1. 33-1. 95).
meta analysis	Conclusions: These results indicate that HPV infection and the incidence of EC are closely associated.
meta analysis	A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review on the Association between Human Papillomavirus (Types 16 and 18) Infection and Esophageal Cancer Worldwide
meta analysis	Background: The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of esophageal cancer remains controversial.
meta analysis	Our study aims to test the association between HPV 16 infection and esophageal cancer in China, providing useful information on this unclear association in Chinese population. Methods: Studies on HPV infection and esophageal cancer were identified.
meta analysis	A random-effects model was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing cases with controls.
meta analysis	Results: A total of 1442 esophageal cancer cases and 1602 controls from 10 included studies were evaluated to estimate the association between HPV 16 infection and esophageal cancer risk. The ORs for each case-control studies ranged from 3.
meta analysis	65 (95% CI: 2. 17, 6. 13) to 15. 44 (95% CI: 3. 42, 69. 70). The pooled estimates for OR was 6. 36 (95% CI: 4. 46, 9. 07). In sensitivity analysis, the estimates for OR ranged from 5. 92 (95% CI: 4. 08, 8. 60) to 6. 97 (95% CI: 4. 89, 9. 93).
meta analysis	Conclusions: This study indicates that HPV-16 infection may be a risk factor for esophageal cancer among Chinese population, supporting an etiological role of HPV16 in this malignancy.
meta analysis	Results in this study may have important implications for esophageal cancer prevention and treatment in China.
meta analysis	The association between human papillomavirus 16 and esophageal cancer in Chinese population: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: The aetiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been widely researched for more than three decades, with conflicting findings.
meta analysis	In the absence of a large, adequately powered single case-control study, a meta-analysis of all available case-control studies is the most rigorous way of identifying any potential association between HPV and OSCC.
meta analysis	We present the first global meta-analysis of case-control studies investigating the role of HPV in OSCC. Methods: Case-control studies investigating OSCC tissue for presence of HPV DNA were identified.
meta analysis	21 case-control studies analyzing a total of 1223 cases and 1415 controls, met our inclusion criteria. HPV detection rates were tabulated for each study and all studies were assessed for quality.
meta analysis	The random effects method was used to pool the odds ratios (OR). Results: From all OSCC specimens included in this meta-analysis, 35% (426/1223) were positive for HPV DNA. The pooled OR for an HPV-OSCC association was 3. 04 (95% CI 2. 20 to 4. 20).
meta analysis	Meta-regression analysis did not find a significant association between OR and any of the quality domains. Influence analysis was non-significant for the effect of individual studies on the pooled estimate.
meta analysis	Studies conducted in countries with low to medium OSCC incidence showed a stronger relationship (OR 4. 65, 95% CI 2. 47 to 8. 76) than regions of high OSCC incidence (OR 2. 65, 95% CI 1. 80 to 3. 91).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Uncertainty around the aetiological role of HPV in OSCC is due largely to the small number and scale of appropriately designed studies. Our meta-analysis of these studies suggests that HPV increases the risk of OSCC three-fold.
meta analysis	This study provides the strongest evidence to date of an HPV-OSCC association. The importance of these findings is that prophylactic vaccination could be of public health benefit in prevention of OSCC in countries with high OSCC incidence.
meta analysis	The aetiological role of human papillomavirus in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Maté, a tea-like infusion of Ilex paraguariensis, is suspected to be a risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; however, no meta-analysis on the subject has been performed to date.
meta analysis	A meta-analysis of studies reporting the consumption of maté in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was conducted to provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with maté consumption.
meta analysis	A search was conducted through MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Current Contents Connect to April 5, 2012.
meta analysis	We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model for the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with exposure to maté (ever- vs.
meta analysis	never-drinkers), as well as for the dose-dependent risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with different levels of maté consumption (highest vs. lowest intake).
meta analysis	Nine studies, with 1565 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases, met our inclusion criteria. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was associated with exposure to maté drink, with an OR of 2. 57 and a 95% CI of 1. 66-3. 98.
meta analysis	There was an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with a higher consumption of maté versus low consumption (OR 2. 76, 95% CI 1. 33-5. 73 vs. OR 1. 84, 95% CI 1. 12-3. 00).
meta analysis	Heterogeneity was observed in the ever versus never and the high-consumption analyses but not in the low-consumption analysis. Publication bias was present. Maté consumption was associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
meta analysis	Maté consumption and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Maté tea is a nonalcoholic infusion widely consumed in southern South America, and may increase risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and other cancers due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and/or thermal injury.
meta analysis	Methods: We pooled two case-control studies: a 1988 to 2005 Uruguay study and a 1986 to 1992 multinational study in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, including 1,400 cases and 3,229 controls.
meta analysis	We computed ORs and fitted a linear excess OR (EOR) model for cumulative maté consumption in liters/day-year (LPDY). Results: The adjusted OR for ESCC with 95% confidence interval (CI) by ever compared with never use of maté was 1. 60 (1. 2-2. 2).
meta analysis	ORs increased linearly with LPDY (test of nonlinearity; P = 0. 69). The estimate of slope (EOR/LPDY) was 0. 009 (0. 005-0. 014) and did not vary with daily intake, indicating maté intensity did not influence the strength of association.
meta analysis	EOR/LPDY estimates for consumption at warm, hot, and very hot beverage temperatures were 0. 004 (-0. 002-0. 013), 0. 007 (0. 003-0. 013), and 0. 016 (0. 009-0. 027), respectively, and differed significantly (P < 0. 01).
meta analysis	EOR/LPDY estimates were increased in younger (<65) individuals and never alcohol drinkers, but these evaluations were post hoc, and were homogeneous by sex.
meta analysis	Conclusions: ORs for ESCC increased linearly with cumulative maté consumption and were unrelated to intensity, so greater daily consumption for shorter duration or lesser daily consumption for longer duration resulted in comparable ORs.
meta analysis	The strength of association increased with higher maté temperatures. Impact: Increased understanding of cancer risks with maté consumption enhances the understanding of the public health consequences given its purported health benefits.
meta analysis	Maté drinking and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in South America: pooled results from two large multicenter case-control studies
meta analysis	Background: Previous studies have mostly focused on the effects of specific constituents of beverages and foods on the risk of esophageal cancer (EC).
meta analysis	An increasing number of studies are now emerging examining the health consequences of the high temperature of beverages and foods.
meta analysis	We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence and clarify the association between hot beverages and foods consumption and EC risk.
meta analysis	Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies, published before May 1, 2014, with the aim to estimate the association between hot beverage and food consumption and EC risk.
meta analysis	A random-effect model was used to pool the results from the included studies. Publication bias was assessed by using the Begg test, the Egger test, and funnel plot.
meta analysis	Results: Thirty-nine studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, giving a total of 42,475 non-overlapping participants and 13,811 EC cases. Hot beverage and food consumption was significantly associated with EC risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.
meta analysis	82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 53-2. 17). The risk was higher for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with a pooled OR of 1. 60 (95% CI, 1. 29-2. 00), and was insignificant for esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR: 0. 79; 95% CI: 0. 53-1. 16).
meta analysis	Subgroup analyses suggests that the association between hot beverage and food consumption and EC risk were significant in Asian population (OR: 2. 06; 95% CI: 1. 62-2. 61) and South American population (OR: 1. 52; 95% CI: 1. 25-1.
meta analysis	85), but not significant in European population (OR: 0. 95; 95% CI: 0. 68-1. 34).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Hot beverage and food consumption is associated with a significantly increased risk of EC, especially in Asian and South American populations, indicating the importance in changing people's dietary habits to prevent EC.
meta analysis	Consumption of hot beverages and foods and the risk of esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies
meta analysis	Background and aims: Alcohol intake is a strong and well established risk factor for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but the association with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) or adjacent tumours of the oesophagogastric junction (OGJA), remains unclear.
meta analysis	Therefore, the association of alcohol intake with OSCC, OA, and OGJA was determined in nine case-control studies and two cohort studies of the Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON).
meta analysis	Materials and methods: Information was collected on alcohol intake, age, sex, education, body mass index, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and tobacco smoking from each study.
meta analysis	Along with 10,854 controls, 1821 OA, and 1837 OGJA, seven studies also collected OSCC cases (n=1016).
meta analysis	Study specific ORs and 95% CIs were calculated from multivariate adjusted logistic regression models for alcohol intake in categories compared to non-drinkers. Summary risk estimates were obtained by random effects models.
meta analysis	Results No increase was observed in the risk of OA or OGJA for increasing levels of any of the alcohol intake measures examined. ORs for the highest frequency category (≥ 7 drinks per day) were 0. 97 (95% CI 0. 68 to 1. 36) for OA and 0.
meta analysis	77 (95% CI = 0. 54 to 1. 10) for OGJA. Suggestive findings linked moderate intake (eg, 0. 5 to <1 drink per day) to decreased risk of OA (OR 0. 63, 95% CI 0. 41 to 0. 99) and OGJA (OR 0. 78, 95% CI 0. 62 to 0. 99).
meta analysis	In contrast, alcohol intake was strongly associated with increased risk of OSCC (OR for ≥ 7 drinks per day 9. 62, 95% CI 4. 26 to 21. 71).
meta analysis	Conclusions: In contrast to OSCC, higher alcohol consumption was not associated with increased risk of either OA or OGJA. The apparent inverse association observed with moderate alcohol intake should be evaluated in future prospective studies.
meta analysis	Alcohol intake and risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma: a pooled analysis from the BEACON Consortium
meta analysis	Background: In the 2007 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Second Expert Report, the expert panel judged that there was strong evidence that alcoholic drinks and body fatness increased esophageal cancer risk, whereas fruits and vegetables probably decreased its risk.
meta analysis	The judgments were mainly based on case-control studies. As part of the Continuous Update Project, we updated the scientific evidence accumulated from cohort studies in this topic.
meta analysis	Methods: We updated the Continuous Update Project database up to 10 January 2017 by searching in PubMed and conducted dose-response meta-analyses to estimate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random effects model.
meta analysis	Results: A total of 57 cohort studies were included in 13 meta-analyses. Esophageal adenocarcinoma risk was inversely related to vegetable intake (RR per 100 g/day: 0. 89, 95% CI: 0. 80-0.
meta analysis	99, n = 3) and directly associated with body mass index (RR per 5 kg/m2: 1. 47, 95% CI: 1. 34-1. 61, n = 9). For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, inverse associations were observed with fruit intake (RR for 100 g/day increment: 0. 84, 95% CI: 0.
meta analysis	75-0. 94, n = 3) and body mass index (RR for 5 kg/m2 increment: 0. 64, 95% CI: 0. 56-0. 73, n = 8), and direct associations with intakes of processed meats (RR for 50 g/day increment: 1. 59, 95% CI: 1. 11-2.
meta analysis	28, n = 3), processed and red meats (RR for 100 g/day increment: 1. 37, 95% CI: 1. 04-1. 82, n = 3) and alcohol (RR for 10 g/day increment: 1. 25, 95% CI: 1. 12-1. 41, n = 6).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Evidence from cohort studies suggested a protective role of vegetables and body weight control in esophageal adenocarcinomas development.
meta analysis	For squamous cell carcinomas, higher intakes of red and processed meats and alcohol may increase the risk, whereas fruits intake may play a protective role.
meta analysis	An update of the WCRF/AICR systematic literature review and meta-analysis on dietary and anthropometric factors and esophageal cancer risk
meta analysis	Quantification of the association between the intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is controversial even though several studies have explored this association.
meta analysis	We summarized the evidence from observational studies in categorical, linear and non-linear dose-response meta-analyses.
meta analysis	Eligible studies published up to 31 July 2012 were retrieved via computer searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as manual review of references.
meta analysis	Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks (SRRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 32 studies involving 10,037 cases of ESCC were included in this meta-analysis. The SRRs for the highest vs.
meta analysis	lowest intake were 0. 56 (95% CI: 0. 45-0. 69) for vegetable intake and 0. 53 (95% CI: 0. 44-0. 64) for fruit intake (pheterogeneity <0. 001 for both). Similar results were observed in a linear dose-response analysis.
meta analysis	There was evidence of non-linear associations for intakes of fruit (pnon-linearity <0. 001) and vegetables (pnon-linearity =0. 041). There was no evidence of publication bias.
meta analysis	These data support the hypothesis that intakes of vegetables and fruit may significantly reduce the risk of ESCC. Further investigation with prospective designs, validated questionnaires and good control of important confounders is warranted.
meta analysis	Intake of fruit and vegetables and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis of observational studies
meta analysis	Background: Oxidative stress may cause gastrointestinal cancers. The evidence on whether antioxidant supplements are effective in preventing gastrointestinal cancers is contradictory.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidant supplements in preventing gastrointestinal cancers.
meta analysis	Search strategy: We identified trials through the trials registers of the four Cochrane Review Groups on gastrointestinal diseases, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and The Chinese Biomedical Database from inception to October 2007.
meta analysis	We scanned reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing antioxidant supplements to placebo/no intervention examining occurrence of gastrointestinal cancers.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two authors (GB and DN) independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcome measures were gastrointestinal cancers, overall mortality, and adverse effects.
meta analysis	Outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analysis. Meta-regression assessed the effect of covariates across the trials.
meta analysis	Main results: We identified 20 randomised trials (211,818 participants), assessing beta-carotene (12 trials), vitamin A (4 trials), vitamin C (8 trials), vitamin E (10 trials), and selenium (9 trials). Trials quality was generally high.
meta analysis	Heterogeneity was low to moderate. Antioxidant supplements were without significant effects on gastrointestinal cancers (RR 0. 94, 95% CI 0. 83 to 1. 06). However, there was significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 54. 0%, P = 0. 003).
meta analysis	The heterogeneity may have been explained by bias risk (low-bias risk trials RR 1. 04, 95% CI 0. 96 to 1. 13 compared to high-bias risk trials RR 0. 59, 95% CI 0. 43 to 0. 80; test of interaction P < 0.
meta analysis	0005), and type of antioxidant supplement (beta-carotene potentially increasing and selenium potentially decreasing cancer risk). The antioxidant supplements had no significant effects on mortality in a random-effects model meta-analysis (RR 1.
meta analysis	02, 95% CI 0. 97 to 1. 07, I(2) = 53. 5%), but significantly increased mortality in a fixed-effect model meta-analysis (RR 1. 04, 95% CI 1. 02 to 1. 07). Beta-carotene in combination with vitamin A (RR 1. 16, 95% CI 1. 09 to 1.
meta analysis	23) and vitamin E (RR 1. 06, 95% CI 1. 02 to 1. 11) significantly increased mortality. Increased yellowing of the skin and belching were non-serious adverse effects of beta-carotene.
meta analysis	In five trials (four with high risk of bias), selenium seemed to show significant beneficial effect on gastrointestinal cancer occurrence (RR 0. 59, 95% CI 0. 46 to 0. 75, I(2) = 0%).
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: We could not find convincing evidence that antioxidant supplements prevent gastrointestinal cancers. On the contrary, antioxidant supplements seem to increase overall mortality.
meta analysis	The potential cancer preventive effect of selenium should be tested in adequately conducted randomised trials.
meta analysis	Antioxidant supplements for preventing gastrointestinal cancers
meta analysis	Background: Observational epidemiological studies have shown that higher intakes of vitamins or antioxidants were inversely associated with the risk of esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported no preventive efficacy of vitamin or antioxidant supplements on esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of vitamin and antioxidant supplements in the prevention of esophageal cancer as reported by RCTs. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in May 2013.
meta analysis	Two authors independently reviewed and selected eligible articles based on predetermined selection criteria. Results: Of 171 articles searched from three databases and relevant bibliographies, 10 RCTs were included in the final analyses.
meta analysis	In a fixed-effect meta-analysis of 10 trials, there was no efficacy of vitamin and antioxidant supplements in the prevention of esophageal cancer (relative risk [RR], 1. 04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 86-1. 25; I(2)=0. 0%).
meta analysis	Also, subgroup meta-analyses showed that vitamin and antioxidant supplements had no preventive efficacy on esophageal cancer both in the high risk (RR, 1. 04; 95% CI, 0. 85-1. 28; n=4) and non-high risk (RR, 1. 01; 95% CI, 0. 65-1.
meta analysis	56; n=6) groups for esophageal cancer. Further, subgroup meta-analyses revealed no preventive efficacy on esophageal cancer by type of methodological quality and type of vitamin and antioxidant supplements.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Unlike observational epidemiological studies, this meta-analysis of RCTs suggests that there is no clinical evidence to support the efficacy of vitamin and antioxidant supplements in the prevention of esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Efficacy of Vitamin and Antioxidant Supplements in Prevention of Esophageal Cancer: Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
meta analysis	Background & aims: Esophageal carcinomas have high fatality rates, making chemoprevention agents desirable.
meta analysis	We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the association of aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: We evaluated the MEDLINE, BIOSIS, and Web of Science electronic databases (1980-2001); manually reviewed the literature; and consulted with experts.
meta analysis	Studies were included if they: (1) evaluated exposure to NSAIDs, aspirin, or both; (2) evaluated esophageal cancer; and (3) reported relative risks or odds ratios or provided data for their calculation.
meta analysis	Data were independently abstracted by 2 investigators. The primary and sensitivity analyses used both fixed and random-effects models. Results: Nine studies (2 cohort, 7 case control) containing 1813 cancer cases were identified.
meta analysis	All primary summary estimates were homogeneous. Statistical pooling showed a protective association between any use of aspirin/NSAID and esophageal cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 47-0. 71). Both intermittent (OR = 0.
meta analysis	82; CI, 0. 67-0. 99) and frequent medication use were protective (OR = 0. 54; CI, 0. 43-0. 67), with greater protection with more frequent use. Stratified by medication type, aspirin use was protective (OR = 0. 5; CI, 0. 38-0.
meta analysis	66), and NSAIDs had a borderline protective association (OR = 0. 75; CI, 0. 54-1. 0). Any use was protective against both esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 0. 67; CI, 0. 51-0. 87) and squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 0. 58; CI, 0. 43-0. 78).
meta analysis	Conclusions: Pooled results support a protective association between aspirin and NSAIDs and esophageal cancer (of both histological types) and provide evidence for a dose effect.
meta analysis	These findings support evaluating these agents in clinical trials of high-risk patients.

meta analysis	The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has markedly increased in the last few decades and Barrett's esophagus is regarded as the precursor lesion of this cancer.
meta analysis	The aim of the study was to quantify the adenocarcinoma risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and to determine at which stage chemoprevention with this drug is the most effective in esophageal inflammation - Barrett's esophagus - adenocarcinoma sequence.
meta analysis	A literature search was performed to identify studies published between 1998 and 2009 for relevant risk estimates.
meta analysis	Fixed and random effect meta-analytical techniques were conducted for aspirin, nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Four cohort and 10 case-control studies were included.
meta analysis	Use of aspirin and nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in normal population was associated with a reduced risk of adenocarcinoma (odds ratio [OR]: 0. 73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0. 65-0. 83; OR: 0. 84, 95% CI: 0. 72-0.
meta analysis	98, respectively). The use of all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was associated with a reduced risk of adenocarcinoma (relative risk [RR]: 0. 64, 95% CI: 0. 42-0. 96) in Barrett's esophagus patients.
meta analysis	However, no obvious dose-effect relationships were found. In addition, we discovered a reverse association between drugs use and adenocarcinoma risk in people without a history of upper gastrointestinal tract disorders (OR: 0. 57, 95% CI: 0. 43-0.
meta analysis	77, P= 0. 12). Our meta-analyses suggest a protective effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the risk of adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	Our results also suggest that the drugs might act after the formation of Barrett's epithelium in the esophageal inflammation - Barrett's esophagus - adenocarcinoma sequence.
meta analysis	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and esophageal inflammation - Barrett's esophagus - adenocarcinoma sequence: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) has risen dramatically in recent decades, and its prognosis remains extremely poor. There is emerging evidence that statins may prevent OAC.
meta analysis	Aim: To systematically review both the experimental and epidemiological evidence to determine whether statins reduce the risk of developing OAC.
meta analysis	Methods: Relevant laboratory and epidemiological studies were identified by systematically searching the PUBMED and EMBASE electronic databases for data on statins and oesophageal cancer (OC).
meta analysis	The evidence was assessed according to the nine Bradford Hill criteria (BHC) of causality. Pooled effect sizes (ES) were calculated for the risk of OC with prior statin use.
meta analysis	Results: Many of the BHC were supported including: 'plausible biological mechanisms', 'coherence', 'strong associations', 'consistency', 'biological gradient', 'analogy' and 'temporality'.
meta analysis	Three experimental studies reported that statins inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and may limit metastatic potential in OAC cell lines.
meta analysis	Fixed effects meta-analysis of two prospective studies in Barrett's oesophagus cohorts, involving 1382 participants, showed an ES of 0. 53 (95% CI = 0. 36-0. 78, P = 0. 001, I(2) = 0%) for risk of OAC with prior statin use.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis of three prospective studies in general population cohorts, involving 35 214 participants, showed an ES of 0. 86 (95% CI = 0. 78-0. 94, P = 0. 001, I(2) = 0%) for risk of OC with prior statin use.
meta analysis	The most important criterion, 'experiment', is as yet unfulfilled as to date there are no clinical trials which investigate this hypothesis.
meta analysis	Conclusion: There is some evidence that statins may protect against the development of OAC, although to be conclusive, data from randomised clinical trials are required.
meta analysis	Systematic review: potential preventive effects of statins against oesophageal adenocarcinoma
meta analysis	Purpose: Laboratory studies have suggested that statins may have useful anti-cancer effects against Barrett's epithelial cancer lines. A variety of effects have been reported in clinical studies.
meta analysis	Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between statin use and the development of oesophageal cancer. Multiple databases were searched for studies reporting the association of statin use and oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis on the relationship between statin use and cancer incidence was performed. Results: Twenty publications met eligibility criteria, yielding 22 datasets for meta-analysis. All were observational studies.
meta analysis	Population-level studies included 372,206 cancer cases and 6,086,906 controls. Studies examining adenocarcinoma development in Barrett's oesophagus included 1057 cancers and 17,741 controls.
meta analysis	In patients with Barrett's oesophagus, statin use was associated with a reduced incidence of adenocarcinoma (pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0. 59 (95% confidence intervals 0. 50-0. 68)), with no heterogeneity between 11 studies.
meta analysis	Population-based studies demonstrated more heterogeneity but showed that statin use was associated with a lower incidence of both oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OR 0. 57 (0. 43-0. 76)) and all oesophageal cancers (OR 0. 82 (0. 7-0. 88)).
meta analysis	Information on statin type, dose, and duration was reported too infrequently for statistical analysis but individual studies showed a tendency to a dose- and duration-dependant decrease in cancer incidence.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Statin use is associated with a significantly lower incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This is seen in both Barrett's cohorts and general populations.
meta analysis	Further studies should focus on drug, dose, and duration and the interaction with other risk and preventative factors.
meta analysis	Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Use of Statins Is Associated with a Reduced Incidence of Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma
meta analysis	Purpose: To systematically review the accuracy of fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in the prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Materials and methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. Methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed.
meta analysis	Sensitivities and specificities of (18)F FDG PET in individual studies were calculated and underwent meta-analysis with a random effects model.
meta analysis	A summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) was constructed with the Moses-Shapiro-Littenberg method. A chi(2) test was performed to test for heterogeneity (defined as P <. 10).
meta analysis	Potential sources for heterogeneity were explored by assessing whether certain covariates significantly (P <. 05) influenced the relative diagnostic odds ratio.
meta analysis	Results: Twenty reports, comprising a total of 849 patients with esophageal cancer, were included. Overall, the studies were of moderate methodologic quality.
meta analysis	Sensitivity and specificity of (18)F FDG PET ranged from 33% to 100% and from 30% to 100%, respectively, with pooled estimates of 67% (95% confidence interval: 62%, 72%) and 68% (95% confidence interval: 64%, 73%), respectively.
meta analysis	The area under the sROC curve was 0. 7815. There was significant heterogeneity in both the sensitivity and specificity of the included studies (P <. 0001). Spearman rho between the logit of sensitivity and the logit of 1-specificity was 0. 086 (P =.
meta analysis	719), which suggested that there was no threshold effect. Studies performed outside of the United States and studies of higher methodologic quality yielded significantly higher overall accuracy.
meta analysis	Conclusion: On the basis of current evidence, (18)F FDG PET should not yet be used in routine clinical practice to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions in patients with esophageal cancer. Supplemental material: http://radiology. rsna.

meta analysis	Prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal cancer with use of 18F FDG PET: a systematic review
meta analysis	Neoadjuvant treatment is a relatively new therapeutic approach for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Response assessment is crucial for the treatment of these patients.
meta analysis	Cross sectional imaging has traditionally being used as the elective method of response assessment.
meta analysis	Recently, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has emerged as a new valuable tool defining therapy response assessment in other tumors.
meta analysis	Aim: We systematically reviewed the increasing number of publications appearing in the literature analyzing the utility of FDG-PET in the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy response assessment.
meta analysis	Methods: We performed a bibliographic search according to the COSI protocol and selected only prospective studies to achieve the highest levels of evidence. Quality assessment was defined with the QUADAS questionnaire.
meta analysis	Results: Eight of 237 potentially relevant publications were selected for the analysis. Ranged sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for primary tumor response assessment were 27. 3% to 93. 3%, 41.
meta analysis	7% to 95. 2%, 70. 8% to 93. 3% and 71. 4% to 93. 5%, respectively, and for N restaging, 16. 0% to 67. 5%, 85. 7% to 100%, 33% to 100% and 91. 7% to 93. 3%, respectively. The heterogeneity of the publications ruled out the possibility of meta-analysis.
meta analysis	FDG-PET is more precise compared with computed tomography in the evaluation of induction therapy response assessment. Conclusion: FDG-PET seems to be the best available imaging modality for neoadjuvant therapy response assessment in esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	But more prospective studies with larger populations are needed to confirm the power of this imaging tool in this aim and to determine the best analytical interpretation method and threshold to differentiate responders from nonresponding patients.
meta analysis	18F-fluorodeoxiglucose positron emission tomography for the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy response in esophageal cancer: systematic review of the literature
meta analysis	Objectives: Neoadjuvant therapy for the treatment of oesophageal cancer was introduced in an effort to improve prognosis. Response assessment is crucial for the treatment of patients with oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Currently, ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (¹⁸F-FDG PET) seems to be the best available tool to assess neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of ¹⁸F-FDG PET for the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy responses in patients with oesophageal cancer using a meta-analysis.
meta analysis	A unified procedure and evaluation standard for ¹⁸F-FDG PET in the assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response should be established.
meta analysis	Methods: All published English-language studies pertaining to the assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer using ¹⁸F-FDG PET in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were collected.
meta analysis	The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies quality assessment tool.
meta analysis	Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained using statistical software.
meta analysis	Results: Thirteen studies included in the meta-analysis fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies quality assessment tool.
meta analysis	The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios for F-¹⁸FDG PET in the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer were 70. 3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 64. 4-75. 8], 70. 1% (95% CI: 65. 1-74.
meta analysis	8) and 9. 389 (95% CI: 3. 482-25. 319), respectively. The area under the curve and the Q value for the summary receiver operating characteristic curve were 0. 8244 and 0. 7575, respectively.
meta analysis	Conclusion: ¹⁸F-FDG PET has some value in the assessment of neoadjuvant therapy response in patients with oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	A 50% reduction in standardized uptake value between pretherapy and posttherapy positron emission tomography scans performed in the first 2 weeks after the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy is the optimal condition for predicting a response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Can ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography predict responses to neoadjuvant therapy in oesophageal cancer patients? A meta-analysis
meta analysis	Objective: The objective of this study was to comprehensively review the evidence for use of pre-treatment, post-treatment and changes in tumour glucose uptake that were assessed by 18-fludeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) early, during or immediately after neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation to predict prognosis of localised oesophagogastric junction (AEG) cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: We searched for articles published in English; limited to AEG; (18)F-FDG uptake on PET performed on a dedicated device; dealt with the impact of standard uptake value (SUV) on survival.
meta analysis	We extracted an estimate of the log hazard ratios (HRs) and their variances and performed meta-analysis. Results: 798 patients with AEG were included.
meta analysis	And the scan time for (18)F-FDG-PET was as follows: prior to therapy (PET1, n=646), exactly 2 weeks after initiation of neoadjuvant therapy (PET2, n=245), and pre-operatively (PET3, n=278).
meta analysis	In the two meta-analyses for overall survival, including the studies that dealt with reduction of tumour maximum SUV (SUV(max)) (from PET1 to PET2/PET3 and from PET1 to PET2), the results were similar, with the overall HR for non-responders being 1.
meta analysis	83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1. 41-2. 36] and 2. 62 (95% CI, 1. 61-4. 26), respectively; as for disease-free survival, the combined HR was 2. 92 (95% CI, 2. 08-4. 10) and 2. 39 (95% CI, 1. 57-3. 64), respectively.
meta analysis	The meta-analyses did not attribute significant prognostic values to SUV(max) before and during therapy in localised AEG. Conclusion: Relative changes in FDG-uptake of AEG are better prognosticators.
meta analysis	Early metabolic changes from PET1 to PET2 may provide the same accuracy for prediction of treatment outcome as late changes from PET1 to PET3.
meta analysis	Prognostic significance of SUV on PET/CT in patients with localised oesophagogastric junction cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation:a systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Published data on the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for staging distant and celiac axis lymph node (CLN) metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer (ECA) has varied.
meta analysis	Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of EUS in diagnosing distal and CLN metastasis in ECA patients. Study selection: EUS studies confirmed by surgery were selected. Statistical method: Pooling was conducted by both fixed and random-effects models.
meta analysis	Results: Data were extracted from 25 studies (N = 2029) which met the inclusion criteria. In ECA patients, pooled sensitivity of EUS was 67. 2% (95% CI: 62. 6-71. 6) in diagnosis of distal metastasis and 66. 6% (95% CI: 61. 9-71.
meta analysis	1) in diagnosis of CLN metastasis. EUS had a pooled specificity of 97. 9% (95% CI: 97. 1-98. 6) for distal metastasis and 98. 1% (95% CI: 97. 3-98. 7) for CLN metastasis.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Although EUS has excellent specificity in accurately diagnosing distal and CLN metastasis in patients with ECA, the sensitivity is low.
meta analysis	Accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis of distal and celiac axis lymph node metastasis in esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review
meta analysis	Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the staging of esophageal cancer. Methods: Only EUS studies confirmed by surgery were selected. Articles were searched in Medline and Pubmed.
meta analysis	Two reviewers independently searched and extracted data. Meta-analysis of the accuracy of EUS was analyzed by calculating pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio.
meta analysis	Pooling was conducted by both the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed effects model) and DerSimonian Laird method (random effects model). The heterogeneity of studies was tested using Cochran's Q test based upon inverse variance weights.
meta analysis	Results: Forty-nine studies (n = 2558) which met the inclusion criteria were included in this analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS to diagnose T1 was 81. 6% (95% CI: 77. 8-84. 9) and 99. 4% (95% CI: 99. 0-99. 7), respectively.
meta analysis	To diagnose T4, EUS had a pooled sensitivity of 92. 4% (95% CI: 89. 2-95. 0) and specificity of 97. 4% (95% CI: 96. 6-98. 0). With Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), sensitivity of EUS to diagnose N stage improved from 84. 7% (95% CI: 82. 9-86. 4) to 96.
meta analysis	7% (95% CI: 92. 4-98. 9). The P value for the c2 test of heterogeneity for all pooled estimates was > 0. 10. Conclusion: EUS has excellent sensitivity and specificity in accurately diagnosing the TN stage of esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	EUS performs better with advanced (T4) than early (T1) disease. FNA substantially improves the sensitivity and specificity of EUS in evaluating N stage disease. EUS should be strongly considered for staging esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Staging accuracy of esophageal cancer by endoscopic ultrasound: a meta-analysis and systematic review
meta analysis	Background and aims: Accurate determination of residual cancer status after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for esophageal cancer could assist in selecting the optimal treatment strategy.
meta analysis	The aim of this study was to review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic biopsy and EUS after nCRT for detecting residual cancer at the primary tumor site (ypT+) and regional lymph nodes (ypN+) as opposed to a pathologic complete response (ypT0 and ypN0).
meta analysis	Methods: PubMed/Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched.
meta analysis	The analysis included diagnostic studies reporting on the accuracy of endoscopic biopsy or EUS in detecting residual cancer versus complete response after nCRT for esophageal cancer with histopathology as the reference standard.
meta analysis	Bivariate random-effects models were used to estimate pooled sensitivities and specificities and examine sources of heterogeneity.
meta analysis	Results: Twenty-three studies comprising 12 endoscopic biopsy studies (1281 patients), 11 EUS studies reporting on ypT status (593 patients), and 10 EUS studies reporting on ypN status (602 patients), were included.
meta analysis	Pooled estimates for sensitivity of endoscopic biopsy after nCRT for predicting ypT+ were 34. 5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26. 0%-44. 1%) and for specificity 91. 0% (95% CI, 85. 6%-94. 5%).
meta analysis	Pooled estimates for sensitivity of EUS after nCRT were 96. 4% (95% CI, 91. 7%-98. 5%) and for specificity were 10. 9% (95% CI, 3. 5%-29. 0%) for detecting ypT+, and 62. 0% (95% CI, 46. 0%-75. 7%) and 56. 7% (95% CI, 41. 8%-70.
meta analysis	5%) for detecting ypN+, respectively. Conclusions: Endoscopic biopsy after nCRT is a specific but not sensitive method for detecting residual esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Although EUS after nCRT yields a high sensitivity, only a limited number of patients will have negative findings at EUS with still a substantial false-negative rate.
meta analysis	Furthermore, EUS provides only moderate accuracy for detecting residual lymph node involvement. Based on these findings, these endoscopic modalities cannot be used to withhold surgical treatment in test-negative patients after nCRT.

meta analysis	Endoscopic biopsy and EUS for the detection of pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Introduction: Up to 32% of patients with esophageal cancer show a pathological complete response (ypCR) after neoadjuvant therapy. To prevent overtreatment, the indication to perform esophagectomy in these patients should be reconsidered.
meta analysis	Implementing an organ-preserving strategy for patients with ypCR requires an accurate assessment of residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment.
meta analysis	The aim of this study was to systematically review the effectiveness of imaging techniques used for detection of ypCR after neoadjuvant therapy but before resection in patients with esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: A systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed from January 1, 2000, to December 13, 2017.
meta analysis	Eligible studies were diagnostic studies that compared results of imaging modalities after neoadjuvant therapy to histopathological findings in the resection specimen after esophagectomy.
meta analysis	Methodological quality was assessed by the Cochrane Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, version 2, model.
meta analysis	Primary outcome measures were true positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true negative values of imaging techniques predicting ypCR. A meta-analysis was performed by pooling sensitivities and specificities by using a bivariate model.
meta analysis	Results: A total of 4420 articles were identified. After exclusion of irrelevant titles and abstracts, 360 articles were reviewed in full text.
meta analysis	In total, four imaging modalities (computed tomography [CT], positron emission tomography [PET-CT], endoscopic ultrasound [EUS], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) were used for restaging.
meta analysis	The meta-analysis was conducted with data from 56 studies involving 3625 patients. The pooled sensitivities of CT, PET-CT, EUS, and MRI for detecting ypCR were 0. 35, 0. 62, 0. 01 and 0. 80, respectively, whereas the pooled specificities were 0.
meta analysis	83, 0. 73, 0. 99, and 0. 83, respectively. The positive predictive value in detecting ypCR was 0. 47 for CT, 0. 41 for PET-CT, not applicable for EUS, and 0. 61 for MRI.
meta analysis	Conclusion: Current imaging modalities such as CT, PET-CT, and EUS seem to be insufficiently accurate to identify complete responders. More accurate diagnostic tests are needed to improve restaging accuracy for patients with esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Detecting Pathological Complete Response in Esophageal Cancer after Neoadjuvant Therapy Based on Imaging Techniques: A Diagnostic Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
meta analysis	Objectives: Endoscopic local procedures are increasingly applied in patients with superficial esophageal cancer as an alternative to radical oncologic resection.
meta analysis	The objective of this article is to determine the risk of nodal metastases in submucosal (sm) esophageal cancer, comparing the two predominating histologic tumor types, squamous cell cancer (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC).
meta analysis	Methods: A query of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library (1980-2009) using predetermined search terms revealed 675 abstracts, of which 485 full-text articles were reviewed. A total of 105 articles met the selection criteria.
meta analysis	A review of article references and consultation with experts revealed additional articles for inclusion. Studies that enrolled patients with submucosal esophageal cancer and provided adequate extractable data were included.
meta analysis	Results: The pooled outcomes of 7645 patients with esophageal cancer involving the sm level of infiltration were included in the analysis. Overall, the percentage of lymph node metastasis in submucosal cancer was 37%.
meta analysis	Lymph node (N), lymphatic (L) and vascular (V) invasion in sm1 esophageal cancers was 27, 46 and 22%, respectively. Within sm2 lesions, N, L and V invasion were involved in 38, 63 and 38% of patients, respectively.
meta analysis	Finally, N, L and V involvement in patients with sm3 lesions was 54, 69 and 47%, respectively.
meta analysis	The rates of lymph node metastasis for sm1 and sm2 were higher in SCC compared with ADC, whereas the lymph node metastasis for sm3 was comparable, with >50% involvement in both histologic subtypes.
meta analysis	SCC revealed an overall more aggressive behavior compared with ADC (N+: 45 vs 26%; L+: 57 vs 37%; V+: 40 vs 18%).
meta analysis	Discussion: While endoscopic therapy may be adequate in selected patients with 'low-risk' sm1 ADC, submucosal SCC necessitates esophageal resection and systematic lymphadenectomy because of its aggressive nature and tendency for early metastasis.
meta analysis	Risk of lymph node metastasis in submucosal esophageal cancer: a review of surgically resected patients
meta analysis	Background and study aims: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been developed to overcome the limitations of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two methods.
meta analysis	Methods: Databases, including Pubmed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, were searched to identify studies comparing ESD with EMR for premalignant and malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract.
meta analysis	In a meta-analysis, primary end points were the en bloc resection rate and the curative resection rate; secondary end points were operation time, and rates of bleeding, perforation, and local recurrence.
meta analysis	Results: 15 nonrandomized studies (seven full-text and eight abstracts) were identified. Meta-analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates (odds ratio [OR] 13. 87, 95 %CI 10. 12 - 18. 99; OR 3. 53, 95 %CI 2. 57 - 4.
meta analysis	84) irrespective of lesion size. Subgroup analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates with ESD for esophageal, gastric, and colorectal neoplasms, and for lesions of size < 10 mm, 10 mm < 20 mm, and > 20 mm.
meta analysis	Local recurrence was lower with ESD (OR 0. 09, 95 %CI 0. 04 - 0. 18). But ESD was more time-consuming than EMR (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1. 76; 95 %CI 0. 60 - 2. 92), and showed high procedure-related bleeding and perforation rates (OR 2.
meta analysis	20, 95 %CI 1. 58 - 3. 07; OR 4. 09, 95 %CI 2. 47 - 6. 80).
meta analysis	Conclusions: ESD showed better en bloc and curative resection rates and local recurrence compared with EMR, but was more time-consuming and had higher rates of bleeding and perforation complications.
meta analysis	These results need to be confirmed by high quality trials and further studies in the west.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis of endoscopic submucosal dissection versus endoscopic mucosal resection for tumors of the gastrointestinal tract
meta analysis	Background: Centralisation of healthcare, especially for advanced cancer surgery, has been a matter of debate.
meta analysis	Clear short-term mortality benefits have been described for oesophageal cancer surgery conducted at high-volume hospitals and by high-volume surgeons.
meta analysis	Objective: To clarify the association between hospital volume, surgeon volume and hospital type in relation to long-term survival after oesophagectomy for cancer, by a meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Design: The systematic literature search included PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane library, EMBASE and Science Citation Index, for the period 1990-2013.
meta analysis	Eligible articles were those which reported survival (time to death) as HRs after oesophagectomy for cancer by hospital volume, surgeon volume or hospital type. Fully adjusted HRs for the longest follow-up were the main outcomes.
meta analysis	Results were pooled by a meta-analysis, and reported as HRs and 95% CIs. Results: Sixteen studies from seven countries met the inclusion criteria. These studies reported hospital volume (N=13), surgeon volume (N=4) or hospital type (N=4).
meta analysis	A survival benefit was found for high-volume hospitals (HR=0. 82, 95% CI 0. 75 to 0. 90), and possibly also, for high-volume surgeons (HR=0. 87, 95% CI 0. 74 to 1. 02) compared with their low-volume counterparts.
meta analysis	No association with survival remained for hospital volume after adjustment for surgeon volume (HR=1. 01, 95% CI 0. 97 to 1. 06; N=2), while a survival benefit was found in favour of high-volume surgeons after adjustment for hospital volume (HR=0.
meta analysis	91, 95% CI 0. 85 to 0. 98; N=2). Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrated better long-term survival (even after excluding early deaths) after oesophagectomy with high-volume surgery, and surgeon volume might be more important than hospital volume.
meta analysis	These findings support centralisation with fewer surgeons working at large centres.
meta analysis	Hospital and surgeon volume in relation to long-term survival after oesophagectomy: systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Open esophagectomy (OE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) reduces complications in resectable esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	The aim of this study is to explore the superiority of MIO in reducing complications and in-hospital mortality than OE. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Wanfang, and Wiley Online Library were thoroughly searched.
meta analysis	Odds ratio (OR)/weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of association. Results: Fifty-seven studies containing 15,790 cases of resectable esophageal cancer were included.
meta analysis	MIO had less intraoperative blood loss, short hospital stay, and high operative time (P < 0. 05) than OE. MIO also had reduced incidence of total complications; (OR = 0. 700, 95% CI = 0. 626 ~ 0. 781, P V < 0. 05), pulmonary complications (OR = 0.
meta analysis	527, 95% CI = 0431 ~ 0. 645, P V < 0. 05), cardiovascular complications (OR = 0. 770, 95% CI = 0. 681 ~ 0. 872, P V < 0. 05), and surgical technology related (STR) complications (OR = 0. 639, 95% CI = 0. 522 ~ 0. 781, P V < 0.
meta analysis	05), as well as lower in-hospital mortality (OR = 0. 668, 95% CI = 0. 539 ~ 0. 827, P V < 0. 05).
meta analysis	However, the number of harvested lymph nodes, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, gastrointestinal complications, anastomotic leak (AL), and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) had no significant difference.
meta analysis	Conclusions: MIO is superior to OE in terms of perioperative complications and in-hospital mortality.
meta analysis	Minimally invasive oesophagectomy versus open esophagectomy for resectable esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Surgery has been the treatment of choice for patients with localized esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Several studies have investigated whether preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery leads to improvement in cure rates, but individual reports have provided conflicting results.
meta analysis	An explicit systematic update of the role of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer is, therefore, warranted.
meta analysis	Objectives: The objective of this review is to determine the role of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with resectable thoracic esophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	Search methods: We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 2013), EMBASE (1988 to 2013), and CANCERLIT (1993 to 2013).
meta analysis	We did not confine our search to English language publications. We updated searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE in October 2013.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: All trials of patients with potentially resectable carcinoma of the esophagus (of any histologic type) who were randomly assigned to chemotherapy or no chemotherapy before surgery.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: The primary outcome was survival, which was assessed with the use of hazard ratios. This is an amendment to the original review, which used risk ratios to assess survival at yearly intervals.
meta analysis	Hazard ratios (HRs) have now been introduced to summarize the complete survival experience in a single analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) were used to compare rates of resection, tumor recurrences, and treatment morbidity and mortality.
meta analysis	Main results: We identified a total of 13 randomized trials involving 2362 participants. Ten trials (2122 participants) reported sufficient detail on survival to be included in a meta-analysis for the primary outcome.
meta analysis	Preoperative chemotherapy improves overall survival (HR 0. 88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 80 to 0. 96) and is associated with a significantly higher rate of complete (R0) resection (RR 1. 11, 95% CI 1. 03 to 1. 19).
meta analysis	No evidence suggests that the overall rate of resection (RR 0. 96, 95% CI 0. 92 to 1. 01), tumor recurrence (RR 0. 81, 95% CI 0. 54 to 1. 22) or nonfatal complications (RR 0. 90; 95% CI 0. 76 to 1.
meta analysis	06) was different for preoperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone. Trials reported risks of toxicity with chemotherapy that ranged from 11% to 90%.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: In summary, preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery offers a survival advantage compared with surgery alone for patients with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer, but the evidence is of moderate quality.
meta analysis	Some evidence of toxicity and preoperative mortality have been associated with chemotherapy.
meta analysis	Preoperative chemotherapy for resectable thoracic esophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: In a previous meta-analysis, we identified a survival benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy before surgery in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	We updated this meta-analysis with results from new or updated randomised trials presented in the past 3 years. We also compared the benefits of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
meta analysis	Methods: To identify additional studies and published abstracts from major scientific meetings, we searched Medline, Embase, and Central (Cochrane clinical trials database) for studies published since January, 2006, and also manually searched for abstracts from major conferences from the same period.
meta analysis	Only randomised studies analysed by intention to treat were included, and searches were restricted to those databases citing articles in English. We used published hazard ratios (HRs) if available or estimates from other survival data.
meta analysis	We also investigated treatment effects by tumour histology and relations between risk (survival after surgery alone) and effect size. Findings: We included all 17 trials from the previous meta-analysis and seven further studies.
meta analysis	12 were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1854), nine were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1981), and two compared neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=194) in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma; one factorial trial included two comparisons and was included in analyses of both neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n=78) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=81).
meta analysis	The updated analysis contained 4188 patients whereas the previous publication included 2933 patients. This updated meta-analysis contains about 3500 events compared with about 2230 in the previous meta-analysis (estimated 57% increase).
meta analysis	The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 0. 78 (95% CI 0. 70-0. 88; p<0. 0001); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0. 80 (0. 68-0. 93; p=0. 004) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0. 75 (0. 59-0. 95; p=0. 02).
meta analysis	The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0. 87 (0. 79-0. 96; p=0. 005); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0. 92 (0. 81-1. 04; p=0. 18) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0. 83 (0. 71-0. 95; p=0. 01).
meta analysis	The HR for the overall indirect comparison of all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0. 88 (0. 76-1. 01; p=0. 07).
meta analysis	Interpretation: This updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence for a survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy over surgery alone in patients with oesophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	A clear advantage of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been established. These results should help inform decisions about patient management and design of future trials.
meta analysis	Funding: Cancer Australia and the NSW Cancer Institute.
meta analysis	Survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for resectable oesophageal carcinoma: an updated meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: The standard treatment for resectable oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is surgical resection with adequate lymphadenectomy. Most Western patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
meta analysis	In recent years some patients have received CRT alone (definitive CRT, dCRT). This meta-analysis sought to clarify the benefits of neoadjuvant and definitive treatment for OSCC.
meta analysis	Methods: Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane database, MEDLINE and Embase. Only RCTs with intention-to-treat analysis, and published hazard ratios (HRs) or estimates from survival data, were included.
meta analysis	Results: Nine RCTs involving neoadjuvant CRT versus surgery, eight involving neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery, and three involving neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery or surgery alone versus dCRT were identified.
meta analysis	The HR for overall survival was 0·81 (95 per cent confidence interval 0·70 to 0·95; P = 0·008) after neoadjuvant CRT and 0·93 (0·81 to 1·08; P = 0·368) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
meta analysis	The likelihood of R0 resection was significantly higher after neoadjuvant treatment (CRT: HR 1·15, P = 0·043; chemotherapy: HR 1·16, P = 0·006).
meta analysis	Morbidity rates were not increased after neoadjuvant CRT (HR 0·94, P = 0·363) but 30-day mortality was non-significantly higher with combined treatment.
meta analysis	Morbidity (HR 1·03, P = 0·638) and mortality (HR 1·04, P = 0·810) rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery did not differ from those after surgery alone.
meta analysis	None of the RCTs reporting outcome after dCRT demonstrated a significant survival benefit, but treatment-related mortality rates were lower (HR 7·60, P = 0·007) than with neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery or surgery alone.
meta analysis	Conclusion: For patients with resectable OSCC, a significant survival benefit for neoadjuvant CRT was evident, with no increase in morbidity rate. dCRT did not demonstrate any survival benefit over other curative strategies.

meta analysis	Meta-analysis of neoadjuvant treatment modalities and definitive non-surgical therapy for oesophageal squamous cell cancer
meta analysis	Background: Please see Appendix 4 for a glossary of terms. The outcome of patients with esophageal cancer is generally poor.
meta analysis	Although multimodal therapy is standard, there is conflicting evidence regarding the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy.
meta analysis	Objectives: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with that of chemoradiotherapy alone in people with nonmetastatic esophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	Search methods: We performed a computerized search for relevant studies, up to Feburary 2017, on the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases using MeSH headings and keywords.
meta analysis	We searched five online databases of clinical trials, handsearched conference proceedings, and screened reference lists of retrieved papers.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy with chemoradiotherapy alone for localized esophageal carcinoma.
meta analysis	We excluded RCTs comparing chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone with esophagectomy.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, using standardized Cochrane methodological procedures.
meta analysis	The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), estimated with Hazard Ratio (HR).
meta analysis	Secondary outcomes, estimated with risk ratio (RR), were local and distant progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), treatment-related mortality and morbidity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia.
meta analysis	Data were analyzed using a random effects model in Review Manager 5. 3 software. Main results: From 2667 references, we identified two randomized studies, in six reports, that included 431 participants.
meta analysis	All participants were clinically staged to have at least T3 and/or node positive thoracic esophageal carcinoma, 93% of which was squamous cell histology. The risk of methodological bias of the included studies was low to moderate.
meta analysis	High-quality evidence found the addition of esophagectomy had little or no difference on overall survival (HR 0. 99, 95% CI 0. 79 to 1. 24; P = 0. 92; I² = 0%; two trials).
meta analysis	Neither study reported PFS, therefore, freedom from loco-regional relapse was used as a proxy. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that the addition of esophagectomy probably improved freedom from locoregional relapse (HR 0. 55, 95% CI 0. 39 to 0.
meta analysis	76; P = 0. 0004; I² = 0%; two trials), but low-quality evidence suggested it may increase the risk of treatment-related mortality (RR 5. 11, 95% CI 1. 74 to 15. 02; P = 0. 003; I² = 2%; two trials).
meta analysis	The other pre-specified outcomes (quality of life, treatment-related toxicity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia) were reported by only one study, which found very low-quality evidence that use of esophagectomy was associated with reduced short-term QoL (MD 0.
meta analysis	93, 95% CI 0. 24 to 1. 62), and low-quality evidence that it reduced use of salvage procedures for dysphagia (HR 0. 52, 95% CI 0. 36 to 0. 75). Neither study compared treatment-related morbidity between treatment groups.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: Based on the available evidence, the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, provides little or no difference on overall survival, and may be associated with higher treatment-related mortality.
meta analysis	The addition of esophagectomy probably delays locoregional relapse, however, this end point was not well defined in the included studies.
meta analysis	It is undetermined whether these results can be applied to the treatment of adenocarcinomas, tumors involving the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction, and to people with poor response to chemoradiation.
meta analysis	Chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy plus surgery for esophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: Esophagectomy is a standard treatment for resectable esophageal cancer but relatively few patients are cured. Combining neoadjuvant chemoradiation with surgery may improve survival but treatment morbidity is a concern.
meta analysis	We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery with the use of surgery alone for esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: Medline and manual searches were done to identify all published RCTs that compared neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery with surgery alone for esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	A random-effects model was used and the odds ratio (OR) was the principal measure of effect. Systematic quantitative review was done for outcomes unique to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment group, such as pathological complete response.
meta analysis	Results: Nine RCTs that included 1,116 patients were selected with quality scores ranging from 1 to 3 (5-point Jadad scale).
meta analysis	Odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]; P value), expressed as chemoradiation and surgery versus surgery alone (treatment versus control; values <1 favor chemoradiation-surgery arm), was 0. 79 (0. 59, 1. 06; P = 0. 12) for 1-year survival, 0. 77 (0.
meta analysis	56, 1. 05; P = 0. 10) for 2-year survival, 0. 66 (0. 47, 0. 92; P = 0. 016) for 3-year survival, 2. 50 (1. 05, 5. 96; P = 0. 038) for rate of resection, 0. 53 (0. 33, 0. 84; P = 0. 007) for rate of complete resection, 1. 72 (0. 96, 3. 07; P = 0.
meta analysis	07) for operative mortality, 1. 63 (0. 99, 2. 68; P = 0. 053) for all treatment mortality, 0. 38 (0. 23, 0. 63; P = 0. 0002) for local-regional cancer recurrence, 0. 88 (0. 55, 1. 41; P = 0. 60) for distant cancer recurrence, and 0. 47 (0. 16, 1.
meta analysis	45; P = 0. 19) for all cancer recurrence. A complete pathological response to chemoradiation occurred in 21% of patients. The 3-year survival benefit was most pronounced when chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given concurrently (OR 0. 45, 95% CI 0.
meta analysis	26 to 0. 79, P = 0. 005) instead of sequentially (OR 0. 82, 95% CI 0. 54 to 1. 25, P = 0. 36). Conclusions: Compared with surgery alone, neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery improved 3-year survival and reduced local-regional cancer recurrence.
meta analysis	It was associated with a lower rate of esophageal resection, but a higher rate of complete (R0) resection. There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased treatment mortality with neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
meta analysis	Concurrent administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy was superior to sequential chemoradiation treatment scheduling.
meta analysis	A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery to surgery alone for resectable esophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: The benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in oesophageal cancer has been extensively studied but data on survival are still equivocal.
meta analysis	Objective: To assess the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in the reduction of mortality in patients with resectable oesophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: Computerised bibliographic searches of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT (1970-2002) were supplemented with hand searches of reference lists.
meta analysis	Study selection: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preoperative chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with surgery alone, and if they included patients with resectable histologically proven oesophageal cancer without metastatic disease.
meta analysis	Six eligible RCTs were identified and included in the meta-analysis.
meta analysis	Data extraction: Data on study populations, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from each RCT according to the intention to treat method by three independent observers and combined using the DerSimonian and Laird method.
meta analysis	Results: Chemoradiotherapy plus surgery compared with surgery alone significantly reduced the three year mortality rate (odds ratio (OR) 0. 53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 31-0. 93); p = 0. 03) (number needed to treat = 10).
meta analysis	Pathological examination showed that preoperative chemoradiotherapy downstaged the tumour (that is, less advanced stage at pathological examination at the time of surgery) compared with surgery alone (OR 0. 43 (95% CI 0. 26-0. 72); p = 0. 001).
meta analysis	The risk for postoperative mortality was higher in the chemoradiotherapy plus surgery group (OR 2. 10 (95% CI 1. 18-3. 73); p = 0. 01).
meta analysis	Conclusions: In patients with resectable oesophageal cancer, chemoradiotherapy plus surgery significantly reduces three year mortality compared with surgery alone.
meta analysis	However, postoperative mortality was significantly increased by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Further large scale multicentre RCTs may prove useful to substantiate the benefit on overall survival.
meta analysis	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
randomized controlled trial	Background: The benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for treating cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction remains controversial.
randomized controlled trial	In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of these two management strategies. Methods: The MEDLINE (PubMed), SinoMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible studies.
randomized controlled trial	We searched for the most relevant studies published until the end of September 2017. Data were extracted independently and were analyzed using RevMan statistical software version 5. 3 (Cochrane Collaboration, http://tech. cochrane.
randomized controlled trial	org/revman/download). Weighted mean differences, risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias.
randomized controlled trial	In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we examined the efficiency of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction as reported in qualified clinical trials.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Six qualified articles that included a total of 866 patients were identified.
randomized controlled trial	The meta-analysis showed that for 3-year and 5-year survival rates in primary outcomes, the results favored neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy strategies compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RR = 0. 78, 95% CI = 0. 62-0. 98, P = 0. 03; RR = 0.
randomized controlled trial	69, 95% CI = 0. 50-0. 96, P = 0. 03, respectively). In terms of secondary outcomes, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy significantly increased the rate of R0 resection and pathological complete response as well (RR = 0. 87, 95% CI = 0. 81-0. 92, P < 0.
randomized controlled trial	0001; RR = 0. 16, 95% CI = 0. 09-0. 28, P < 0. 00001, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in postoperative mortality between the two groups (RR = 1. 85, 95% CI = 0. 93-3. 65, P = 0. 08).
randomized controlled trial	For the results of postoperative complications, revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative complications such as pulmonary, anastomotic leak and cardiovascular complications.
randomized controlled trial	The subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma showed that both esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients achieved a high rate of R0 resection (RR = 0. 85, 95% CI = 0. 77-0. 93, P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	0006; RR = 0. 88, 95% CI = 0. 81-0. 96, P = 0. 005, respectively) and pathological complete response benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (RR = 0. 23, 95% CI = 0. 09-0. 57, P = 0. 001; RR = 0. 18, 95% CI = 0. 03-0. 96, P = 0. 05, respectively).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Our findings suggested that compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be recommended with a significant long-term survival benefit in patients with cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction.
randomized controlled trial	In view of the clinical heterogeneity, whether these conclusions are broadly applicable should be further determined.
randomized controlled trial	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction: A meta-analysis based on clinical trials
meta analysis	Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery is a standard treatment for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. However, the roles of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy in treating oesophageal cancer remain controversial.
meta analysis	In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we examine the efficacy of adding radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for treating oesophageal cancer as reported in qualified randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
meta analysis	We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, Google Scholar and the American Society of Clinical Oncology database to identify relevant studies up to 31 March 2016.
meta analysis	Data including the pathological complete response rate, R0 resection rate and 3-year survival rate were extracted and analysed. Five qualified RCTs were included with a total of 709 patients.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis showed that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy significantly increases the rates of pathological complete response and R0 resection in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
meta analysis	However, we found a significantly increased 3-year survival rate only in oesophageal SCC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (56. 8 and 42. 8%, respectively); relative risk (RR): 1.
meta analysis	31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1. 10-1. 58, P = 0. 003]. In oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients, no significant survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was found compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (46. 3 and 41.
meta analysis	0%, respectively; RR: 1. 13, 95% CI 0. 88-1. 45, P = 0. 34). Our meta-analysis adds to the evidence showing that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be the standard preoperative treatment strategy for locally advanced oesophageal SCC.
meta analysis	For oesophageal adenocarcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone may be the best preoperative treatment strategy to avoid the risk of adverse effects of radiotherapy.
meta analysis	Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the options for neoadjuvant therapy for treating oesophageal cancer
meta analysis	Background: Almost half of people with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy and targeted therapies are increasingly used with a palliative intent to control tumor growth, improve quality of life, and prolong survival.
meta analysis	To date, and with the exception of ramucirumab, evidence for the efficacy of palliative treatments for esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer is lacking.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the effects of cytostatic or targeted therapy for treating esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer with palliative intent.
meta analysis	Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, PubMed Publisher, Google Scholar, and trial registries up to 13 May 2015, and we handsearched the reference lists of studies.
meta analysis	We did not restrict the search to publications in English. Additional searches were run in September 2017 prior to publication, and they are listed in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy versus best supportive care or control in people with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of eligible studies according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
meta analysis	We calculated pooled estimates of effect using an inverse variance random-effects model for meta-analysis. Main results: We identified 41 RCTs with 11,853 participants for inclusion in the review as well as 49 ongoing studies.
meta analysis	For the main comparison of adding a cytostatic and/or targeted agent to a control arm, we included 11 studies with 1347 participants.
meta analysis	This analysis demonstrated an increase in overall survival in favor of the arm with an additional cytostatic or targeted therapeutic agent with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 68 to 0. 84, high-quality evidence).
meta analysis	The median increased survival time was one month. Five studies in 750 participants contributed data to the comparison of palliative therapy versus best supportive care.
meta analysis	We found a benefit in overall survival in favor of the group receiving palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy compared to best supportive care (HR 0. 81, 95% CI 0. 71 to 0. 92, high-quality evidence).
meta analysis	Subcomparisons including only people receiving second-line therapies, chemotherapies, targeted therapies, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas all showed a similar benefit.
meta analysis	The only individual agent that more than one study found to improve both overall survival and progression-free survival was ramucirumab.
meta analysis	Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy increased the frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicity. However, treatment-related deaths did not occur more frequently.
meta analysis	Quality of life often improved in the arm with an additional agent. Authors' conclusions: People who receive more chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agents have an increased overall survival compared to people who receive less.
meta analysis	These agents, administered as both first-line or second-line treatments, also led to better overall survival than best supportive care. With the exception of ramucirumab, it remains unclear which other individual agents cause the survival benefit.
meta analysis	Although treatment-associated toxicities of grade 3 or more occurred more frequently in arms with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent, there is no evidence that palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy decrease quality of life.
meta analysis	Based on this meta-analysis, palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy can be considered standard care for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.
meta analysis	Palliative chemotherapy and targeted therapies for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer
meta analysis	Background: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. In "Western" countries, most people are either diagnosed at an advanced stage, or develop a relapse after surgery with curative intent.
meta analysis	In people with advanced disease, significant benefits from targeted therapies are currently limited to HER-2 positive disease treated with trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, in first-line.
meta analysis	In second-line, ramucirumab, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, demonstrated significant survival benefits. Thus, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Uncertainty remains regarding the choice of the regimen.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the efficacy of chemotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC), combination versus single-agent chemotherapy and different chemotherapy combinations in advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase up to June 2016, reference lists of studies, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We considered only RCTs on systemic, intravenous or oral chemotherapy versus BSC, combination versus single-agent chemotherapy and different chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently identified studies and extracted data. A third investigator was consulted in case of disagreements. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.
meta analysis	Main results: We included 64 RCTs, of which 60 RCTs (11,698 participants) provided data for the meta-analysis of overall survival. We found chemotherapy extends overall survival (OS) by approximately 6. 7 months more than BSC (hazard ratio (HR) 0.
meta analysis	3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0. 24 to 0. 55, 184 participants, three studies, moderate-quality evidence). Combination chemotherapy extends OS slightly (by an additional month) versus single-agent chemotherapy (HR 0. 84, 95% CI 0. 79 to 0.
meta analysis	89, 4447 participants, 23 studies, moderate-quality evidence), which is partly counterbalanced by increased toxicity.
meta analysis	The benefit of epirubicin in three-drug combinations, in which cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU is replaced by capecitabine is unknown. Irinotecan extends OS slightly (by an additional 1.
meta analysis	6 months) versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens (HR 0. 87, 95% CI 0. 80 to 0. 95, 2135 participants, 10 studies, high-quality evidence). Docetaxel extends OS slightly (just over one month) compared to non-docetaxel-containing regimens (HR 0.
meta analysis	86, 95% CI 0. 78 to 0. 95, 2001 participants, eight studies, high-quality evidence).
meta analysis	However, due to subgroup analyses, we are uncertain whether docetaxel-containing combinations (docetaxel added to a single-agent or two-drug combination) extends OS due to moderate-quality evidence (HR 0. 80, 95% CI 0. 71 to 0.
meta analysis	91, 1466 participants, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). When another chemotherapy was replaced by docetaxel, there is probably little or no difference in OS (HR 1. 05; 0. 87 to 1.
meta analysis	27, 479 participants, three studies, moderate-quality evidence). We found there is probably little or no difference in OS when comparing capecitabine versus 5-FU-containing regimens (HR 0. 94, 95% CI 0. 79 to 1.
meta analysis	11, 732 participants, five studies, moderate-quality evidence). Oxaliplatin may extend (by less than one month) OS versus cisplatin-containing regimens (HR 0. 81, 95% CI 0. 67 to 0. 98, 1105 participants, five studies, low-quality evidence).
meta analysis	We are uncertain whether taxane-platinum combinations with (versus without) fluoropyrimidines extend OS due to very low-quality evidence (HR 0. 86, 95% CI 0. 71 to 1. 06, 482 participants, three studies, very low-quality evidence).
meta analysis	S-1 regimens improve OS slightly (by less than an additional month) versus 5-FU-containing regimens (HR 0. 91, 95% CI 0. 83 to 1.
meta analysis	00, 1793 participants, four studies, high-quality evidence), however since S-1 is used in different doses and schedules between Asian and non-Asian population, the applicability of this finding to individual populations is uncertain.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: Chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional 6. 7 months) in comparison to BSC, and combination chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional month) compared to single-agent 5-FU.
meta analysis	Testing all patients for HER-2 status may help to identify patients with HER-2-positive tumours, for whom, in the absence of contraindications, trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine or 5-FU in combination with cisplatin has been shown to be beneficial.
meta analysis	For HER-2 negative people, all different two-and three-drug combinations including irinotecan, docetaxel, oxaliplatin or oral 5-FU prodrugs are valid treatment options for advanced gastric cancer, and consideration of the side effects of each regimen is essential in the treatment decision.
meta analysis	Irinotecan-containing combinations and docetaxel-containing combinations (in which docetaxel was added to a single-agent or two-drug (platinum/5-FUcombination) show significant survival benefits in the comparisons studied above.
meta analysis	Furthermore, docetaxel-containing three-drug regimens have increased response rates, but the advantages of the docetaxel-containing three-drug combinations (DCF, FLO-T) are counterbalanced by increased toxicity.
meta analysis	Additionally, oxaliplatin-containing regimens demonstrated a benefit in OS as compared to the same regimen containing cisplatin, and there is a modest survival improvement of S-1 compared to 5-FU-containing regimens.
meta analysis	Whether the survival benefit for three-drug combinations including cisplatin, 5-FU, and epirubicin as compared to the same regimen without epirubicin is still valid when second-line therapy is routinely administered and when cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU by capecitabine is questionable.
meta analysis	Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed survival benefits for the three-drug regimens is not large enough to be clinically meaningful as defined recently by the American Society for Clinical Oncology (Ellis 2014).
meta analysis	In contrast to the comparisons in which a survival benefit was observed by adding a third drug to a two-drug regimen at the cost of increased toxicity, the comparison of regimens in which another chemotherapy was replaced by irinotecan was associated with a survival benefit (of borderline statistical significance), but without increased toxicity.
meta analysis	For this reason irinotecan/5-FU-containing combinations are an attractive option for first-line treatment.
meta analysis	Although they need to be interpreted with caution, subgroup analyses of one study suggest that elderly people have a greater benefit form oxaliplatin, as compared to cisplatin-based regimens, and that people with locally advanced disease or younger than 65 years might benefit more from a three-drug regimen including 5-FU, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin as compared to a two-drug combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatin, a hypothesis that needs further confirmation.
meta analysis	For people with good performance status, the benefit of second-line chemotherapy has been established in several RCTs.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer
meta analysis	Background: Cisplatin has been largely used in the treatment of advanced, unresectable gastric cancer, mainly in combinations with fluoropyrimidines and anthracyclines.
meta analysis	Oxaliplatin has been shown to be at least as effective as cisplatin for this disease, but with less toxicity and a better tolerability profile, especially for older patients.
meta analysis	We performed a systematic review of the literature to address and quantify differences in the efficacy and the safety between oxaliplatin and cisplatin for the treatment of this disease.
meta analysis	Methods: The literature was searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oxaliplatin to cisplatin. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze dichotomous variables.
meta analysis	Hazard ratios (HRs) for progression and death were combined with an inverse variance method based on logarithmic conversion. A fixed effect model and Mantel-Haenszel's (M-H) method were used.
meta analysis	Heterogeneity was tested with the Q test and the I (2) value. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Three RCTs were identified, involving a total of 1294 patients. Oxaliplatin significantly improved progression-free survival (HR = 0.
meta analysis	88, p = 0. 02) and overall survival (HR = 0. 88, p = 0. 04). Moreover, it was associated with less neutropenia (OR = 0. 53, p < 0. 01) and fewer thromboembolic events (OR = 0. 42, p < 0.
meta analysis	01), but it was also associated with increased neurotoxicity (OR = 6. 91, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Our results support the existence of a small but significant survival benefit of oxaliplatin over cisplatin.
meta analysis	Oxaliplatin is associated with less toxicity and better tolerability, especially in older patients and when used in two-drug, bi-weekly regimens.
meta analysis	Effectiveness and safety of oxaliplatin compared to cisplatin for advanced, unresectable gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: There is a lack of large-scale randomised data evaluating the impact of sex and age in patients undergoing chemotherapy followed by potentially curative surgery for oesophagogastric cancer.
meta analysis	Patients and methods: Individual patient data from four prospective randomised controlled trials were pooled using a two-stage meta-analysis.
meta analysis	For survival analysis, hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for patients aged <70 and ≥ 70 years, as well as between males and females.
meta analysis	Mandard tumour regression grade (TRG) and, ≥grade III toxicities were compared using logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios. All analyses were adjusted for the type of chemotherapy received.
meta analysis	Results: 3265 patients were included for survival analysis (2668 [82%] male, 597 [18%] female; 2627 (80%) <70 years, 638 (20%) ≥70 years). A significant improvement in overall survival (OS) (HR: 0. 78; p < 0.
meta analysis	001) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR: 0. 78; p < 0. 001) was observed in females compared with males. No significant differences in OS (HR: 1. 11; p = 0. 045) or DSS (HR: 1. 01; p = 0.
meta analysis	821) were observed in older patients compared with younger patients. For patients who underwent resection, older patients (15% vs 10%; p = 0. 03) and female patients (14% vs 10%, p = 0. 10) were more likely to achieve favourable Mandard TRG scores.
meta analysis	Females experienced significantly more ≥grade III nausea (10% vs 5%; p≤0. 001), vomiting (10% vs 4%; p≤0. 001) and diarrhoea (9% vs 4%; p≤0. 001) than males.
meta analysis	Conclusions: In this large pooled analysis using prospective randomised trial data, females had significantly improved survival while experiencing more gastrointestinal toxicities.
meta analysis	Older patients achieved comparable survival to younger patients and thus, dependent on fitness, should be offered the same treatment paradigm.
meta analysis	Impact of sex and age on chemotherapy efficacy, toxicity and survival in localised oesophagogastric cancer: A pooled analysis of 3265 individual patient data from four large randomised trials (OE02, OE05, MAGIC and ST03)
meta analysis	Objective: Evaluate the existing literature comparing long-term survival after minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) and open esophagectomy (OE), and conduct a meta-analysis based on relevant studies.
meta analysis	Background: It is unknown whether the choice between MIE and OE influences the long-term survival in esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: A systematic electronic search for articles was performed in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for studies comparing long-term survival after MIE and OE. Additionally, an extensive hand-search was conducted.
meta analysis	The I test and χ test were used to test for statistical heterogeneity. Publication bias and small-study effects were assessed using Egger test.
meta analysis	A random-effects meta-analysis was performed for all-cause 5-year (main outcome) and 3-year mortality, and disease-specific 5-year and 3-year mortality.
meta analysis	Meta-regression was performed for the 5-year mortality outcomes with adjustment for the covariates age, physical status, tumor stage, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
meta analysis	The results were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The review identified 55 relevant studies. Among all 14,592 patients, 7358 (50. 4%) underwent MIE and 7234 (49. 6%) underwent OE.
meta analysis	The statistical heterogeneity was limited [I = 12%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0%-41%, and χ = 0. 26] and the funnel plot was symmetrical both according to visual and statistical testing (Egger test = 0. 32).
meta analysis	Pooled analysis revealed 18% lower 5-year all-cause mortality after MIE compared with OE (HR 0. 82, 95% CI 0. 76-0. 88). The meta-regression indicated no confounding.
meta analysis	Conclusions: The long-term survival after MIE compares well with OE and may even be better. Thus, MIE can be recommended as a standard surgical approach for esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Long-term Survival in Esophageal Cancer After Minimally Invasive Compared to Open Esophagectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
meta analysis	Objective: The aim of this study is to identify preoperative patient-related prognostic factors for anastomotic leakage, mortality, and major complications in patients undergoing oncological esophagectomy.
meta analysis	Background: Esophagectomy is a high-risk procedure with an incidence of major complications around 25% and short-term mortality around 4%.
meta analysis	Methods: We systematically searched the Medline and Embase databases for studies investigating the associations between patient-related prognostic factors and anastomotic leakage, major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIa), and/or 30-day/in-hospital mortality after esophagectomy for cancer.
meta analysis	Results: Thirty-nine eligible studies identifying 37 prognostic factors were included. Cardiac comorbidity was associated with anastomotic leakage, major complications, and mortality.
meta analysis	Male sex and diabetes were prognostic factors for anastomotic leakage and major complications. Additionally, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score > III and renal disease were associated with anastomotic leakage and mortality.
meta analysis	Pulmonary comorbidity, vascular comorbidity, hypertension, and adenocarcinoma tumor histology were identified as prognostic factors for anastomotic leakage. Age > 70 years, habitual alcohol usage, and body mass index (BMI) 18.
meta analysis	5-25 kg/m2 were associated with increased risk for mortality.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Various patient-related prognostic factors are associated with anastomotic leakage, major postoperative complications, and postoperative mortality following oncological esophagectomy.
meta analysis	This knowledge may define case-mix adjustment models used in benchmarking or auditing and may assist in selection of patients eligible for surgery or tailored perioperative care.
meta analysis	Patient-Related Prognostic Factors for Anastomotic Leakage, Major Complications, and Short-Term Mortality Following Esophagectomy for Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses
meta analysis	Background: Numerous ongoing trials are testing anti-PD-1-based or anti-PD-L1-based cancer treatment combinations. Understanding the toxicity profiles of treatment-related adverse events is essential.
meta analysis	The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the incidences and profiles of treatment-related adverse events across different combination therapies.
meta analysis	Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing different chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy combinations with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.
meta analysis	We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2000, and May 21, 2020, investigating globally approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies.
meta analysis	Only prospective trials reporting overall incidence or tabulated data of treatment-related adverse events were included.
meta analysis	Trials investigating sequential therapies, comprising three or more classes of therapies, and enrolling less than ten patients were excluded.
meta analysis	The primary outcomes were overall incidences and profiles for all-grade and grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events by random-effect models. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with I2 statistics.
meta analysis	The summary measures for main outcomes are incidences (95% CI). The 95% CI were calculated together with the incidence through a random-effects model with a logit transformation. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020189617).
meta analysis	Findings: We identified 2540 records, of which 161 studies (17 197 patients) met the inclusion criteria.
meta analysis	The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events in the chemotherapy combination was 97·7% (95% CI 96·4-98·5; I2=75%) for all-grade adverse events and 68·3% (60·7-75·0; I2=93%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; in the targeted therapy combination was 94·5% (90·7-96·8; I2=86%) for all-grade adverse events and 47·3% (37·3-57·5; I2=93%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; in the immunotherapy combination was 86·8% (80·9-91·1; I2=94%) for all-grade adverse events and 35·9% (29·5-42·9; I2=92%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events; and in the radiotherapy combination was 89·4% (69·0-96·9; I2=74%) for all-grade adverse events and 12·4% (4·4-30·6; I2=73%) for grade 3 or higher adverse events.
meta analysis	For these four combination therapies, the most common all-grade adverse events were anaemia (45.
meta analysis	4% [95% CI 32·4-59·1]), fatigue (34·3% [27·5-41·9]), fatigue (26·4% [19·2-35·2]), and dysphagia (30·0% [18·7-44·5]), respectively, and the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (19·6% [13·5-27·7]), hypertension (9·3% [5·7-14·9]), lipase increased (7·2% [5·2-9·9]), and lymphopenia (10·3% [4·5-21·8]).
meta analysis	All included randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias. Interpretation: Our study provides comprehensive data on treatment-related adverse events of different PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies.
meta analysis	Our results provide an essential reference of toxicity profiles of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies for clinicians in routine practice of cancer care.

meta analysis	Treatment-related adverse events of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor-based combination therapies in clinical trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis
meta analysis	Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in treating superficial esophageal cancer (SEC).
meta analysis	Methods: Studies investigating the safety and efficacy of ESD and EMR for SEC were searched from the databases of Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library.
meta analysis	Primary end points included the en bloc resection rate and the curative resection rate. Secondary end points included operative time, rates of perforation, postoperative esophageal stricture, bleeding and local recurrence.
meta analysis	The random-effect model and the fixed-effect model were used for statistical analysis. Results: Eight studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis.
meta analysis	As shown by the pooled analysis, ESD had significantly higher en bloc and curative resection rates than EMR. Local recurrence rate in the ESD group was remarkably lower than that in the EMR group.
meta analysis	However, operative time and perforation rate for ESD were significantly higher than those for EMR. As for the rate of postoperative esophageal stricture and procedure-related bleeding, no significant difference was found between the two techniques.
meta analysis	Conclusion: ESD seems superior to EMR in the treatment of SEC as evidenced by significantly higher en bloc and curative resection rates and by obviously lower local recurrence rate.

review	Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common type of cancer worldwide and constitutes the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths.
review	It is characterized by its high mortality rate, poor prognosis at time of diagnosis and variability based on geographic location. Present day, the prevalence of esophageal cancer is in transition.
review	Although esophageal squamous cell carcinoma continues to be the most prevalent type worldwide, esophageal adenocarcinoma is quickly becoming the most prevalent type in developed countries.
review	Risk factors for the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma include low socioeconomic status, consumption of tobacco, alcohol, hot beverages, and nitrosamines.
review	Additionally, micronutrient deficiencies have also been linked to the development of esophageal squamous cell cancer. These include vitamin C, vitamin E, and folate.
review	With respect to esophageal adenocarcinoma, risk factors include Barrett's esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, and tobacco consumption.
review	Screening for esophageal cancer will likely play an essential role in prevention, and consequently, mortality in the future. Present day, there are no established guidelines for esophageal squamous cell cancer screening.
review	Guidelines for esophageal adenocarcinoma are more well established but lack concrete evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials.
review	This review will discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, and current prevention strategies for esophageal cancer in depth. It is our aim to raise awareness on the aforementioned topics to increase public health efforts in eradicating this disease.
review	Epidemiology of esophageal cancer: update in global trends, etiology and risk factors
review	Idiopathic achalasia and Barrett's esophagus (BE) are preneoplastic conditions of the esophagus. BE increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), while achalasia is associated with both EAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
review	However, while the molecular mechanisms underlying the transformation of esophageal epithelial cells in BE are relatively well characterized, less is known regarding these processes in achalasia.
review	Nevertheless, both conditions are associated with chronic inflammation and BE can occur in achalasia patients, and it is likely that similar processes underlie cancer risk in both diseases.
review	The present review will discuss possible lessons that we can learn from the molecular analysis of BE for the study of achalasia-associated cancer and contrast findings in BE with those in achalasia.
review	First, we will describe cellular fate during development of BE, EAC, and ESCC, and consider the inflammatory status of the epithelial barrier in BE and achalasia in terms of its contribution to carcinogenesis.
review	Next, we will summarize current data on genetic alterations and molecular pathways involved in these processes.
review	Lastly, the plausible role of the microbiota in achalasia-associated carcinogenesis and its contribution to abnormal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) functioning, the maintenance of chronic inflammatory status and influence on the esophageal mucosa through carcinogenic by-products, will be discussed.
review	Achalasia and associated esophageal cancer risk: What lessons can we learn from the molecular analysis of Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma?
review	This article reviews the environmental risk factors and predisposing conditions for the two main histologic types of esophageal cancer.
review	Tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, drinking maté, low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, achalasia, and low socioeconomic status increase the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
review	Results of investigations on other potential risk factors, including opium consumption, intake of hot drinks, eating pickled vegetables, poor oral health, and exposure to human papillomavirus, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, N-nitroso compounds, acetaldehyde, and fumonisins are discussed.
review	Gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, tobacco smoking, hiatal hernia, achalasia, and, probably, absence of H pylori in the stomach increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Results of studies investigating other factors are also discussed.
review	Environmental causes of esophageal cancer
review	Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is the premalignant condition associated with the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC).
review	Diagnostically, p53 immunohistochemistry remains the only biomarker recommended clinically to aid histopathological diagnosis.
review	The emerging mutational profile of BE is one of highly heterogeneous lesions at the genomic level with many mutations already occurring in non-dysplastic tissue.
review	As well as point mutations, larger scale copy-number changes appear to have a key role in the progression to OAC and clinically applicable assays for the reliable detection of aneuploidy will be important to incorporate into future clinical management of patients.
review	For some patients, the transition to malignancy may occur rapidly through a genome-doubling event or chromosomal catastrophe, termed chromothripsis, and detecting these patients may prove especially difficult.
review	Given the heterogeneous nature of this disease, sampling methods to overcome inherent bias from endoscopic biopsies coupled with the development of more objective biomarkers than the current reliance on histopathology will be required for risk stratification.
review	The aim of this approach will be to spare low-risk patients unnecessary procedures, as well as to provide endoscopic therapy to the patients at highest risk, thereby avoiding the burden of incurable metastatic disease.
review	Genetic progression of Barrett's oesophagus to oesophageal adenocarcinoma
review	Excessive alcohol consumption and heavy smoking are the main risk factors for upper digestive tract cancers. Cancer risk is dose-dependent and alcohol and smoking have synergistic effects. Alcohol is not carcinogenic.
review	However, its first metabolite-acetaldehyde-has recently been shown to be a local carcinogen in humans. Microbes representing normal human gut flora are able to produce acetaldehyde from ethanol.
review	This results in high local acetaldehyde concentrations in the saliva and contents of the large intestine.
review	Asian heavy drinkers with a genetic deficiency for detoxifying acetaldehyde form an exceptional human 'knockout' model for long-term acetaldehyde exposure. The risk of alcohol-related digestive tract cancers is particularly high among this population.
review	All mechanisms that have an effect on salivary or intracolonic acetaldehyde concentration are of importance.
review	The message for prevention is that one should take care to have good oral hygiene and to avoid smoking, heavy drinking and drinking to intoxication.
review	Alcohol consumption and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract
review	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a major cause of cancer-related death, particularly in Western populations, and is rapidly rising in Asian populations at this time.
review	Virtually all EACs develop from the precursor lesion Barrett's esophagus (BE), which is the most significant risk factor for EAC. However, the rates of progression from BE to EAC are low and patients with BE are asymptomatic.
review	Thus, any strategy for EAC prevention must carry a low risk of harm in order to be clinically useful.
review	Since current EAC-screening and BE-surveillance methods carry some procedural risk and are burdensome, there is an opportunity for chemoprevention, i. e. medications or dietary factors that may prevent BE from progressing to EAC.
review	A variety of candidate chemoprevention therapies have been assessed to date.
review	Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the best studied and have modest EAC-chemoprevention efficacy in BE patients, with a recent randomized trial showing that high-dose PPI may be more effective than low-dose PPI.
review	Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have moderate quality observational and randomized-trial evidence for preventing progression of BE to EAC, but their risks for harm have precluded their routine clinical use.
review	Other therapies (statins, metformin, female sex hormones) generally do not have strong evidence to support their use in EAC chemoprevention.
review	Although progress has been made in this field, there is still a need for more effective and safe chemoprevention therapies for EAC.

review	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to discuss the role of imaging in the management of esophageal cancer. CONCLUSION.
review	A multimodality-based approach to imaging is essential in clinical practice to achieve the best possible outcome for patients with esophageal cancer.
review	Radiologists must be aware of the strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities in various clinical settings.
review	The role of a radiologist is to combine information from anatomic and functional imaging, assess metastatic disease and changes in the primary tumor during treatment, and identify anatomic complications after treatment.
review	Role of Imaging in Esophageal Cancer Management in 2020: Update for Radiologists
review	Aims: To provide evidence-based practice guideline recommendations on the use of fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for diagnosis, staging, assessing treatment response, liver metastasis and restaging or recurrence of oesophageal cancer.
review	Materials and methods: A systematic review by Facey et al. (Health Technology Assessment 2007;11(44):iii-iv, xi-267) was used as the evidence base for recommendation development.
review	As the review was limited to August 2005, the evidence base was updated to May 2010 using the same search strategies for MEDLINE and EMBASE used in the original review.
review	The authors of the current systematic review drafted recommendations, which were reviewed, adapted and accepted by consensus by the Ontario provincial Gastrointestinal Disease Site Group and a special meeting of clinical experts.
review	Results: The results from the Facey et al. review for oesophageal cancer included four other systematic reviews and six primary studies. The 2005 to 2010 updated search included two additional systematic reviews and 29 primary studies.
review	Recommendations were developed based on this evidence and accepted by consensus.
review	Conclusions: PET is recommended to improve the accuracy of M staging for the staging work-up of patients with oesophageal cancer who are potential candidates for curative therapy.
review	Due to insufficient evidence, no recommendation was made for or against the use of PET for the assessment of treatment response and the evaluation of suspected recurrence.
review	Evidence-based guideline recommendations on the use of positron emission tomography imaging in oesophageal cancer
review	Since its advent in the 1980s endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has played an important role in the diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic management of various gastrointestinal malignancies.
review	EUS has emerged as a vital tool in the evaluation of esophageal cancer as it provides a detailed view of the layers of the esophageal wall and surrounding tissues. This permits determination of tumor invasion depth and local lymph node metastases.
review	It is the most sensitive and specific method available for locoregional staging of esophageal cancer. The information obtained via EUS is vital in determining the appropriate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options.
review	Thus, this article aims to present a review of the accuracy and utilization of EUS in the staging of esophageal cancer.
review	Accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound in esophageal cancer staging
review	Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world today and the sixth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Accurate preoperative staging of esophageal cancer is imperative to the selection of appropriate treatments.
review	Patients with esophageal carcinomas typically undergo a multimodality staging process including noninvasive imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), as well as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which is slightly more invasive.
review	Minimally invasive surgical staging, with laparoscopy, occasionally in combination with video-assisted thoracoscopy, is used in the staging process at select institutions and has been shown to be more accurate than noninvasive staging modalities.
review	Two major advantages of minimally invasive surgical staging over conventional techniques are the improved assessment of locoregional disease and enhanced identification of distant metastases.
review	These advantages decrease the likelihood that the patient will undergo a nontherapeutic laparotomy.
review	Currently, no clear consensus exists regarding which patients with esophageal cancer would benefit most from the addition of minimally invasive surgical staging.
review	We have, however, found that minimally invasive surgical staging with laparoscopy is particularly valuable in detection of occult distant metastases.
review	In this article, we summarize the staging modalities for esophageal cancer including minimally invasive surgical staging.
review	Minimally invasive staging of esophageal cancer
review	Confocal laser endomicroscopy is an advanced endoscopic imaging modality that can be used for the diagnosis of early mucosal dysplasia in various gastrointestinal conditions. It provides histology-like images at 1000-fold magnification.
review	The technology offers potential advantages in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus and early esophageal cancer due to the low yield of the current practice of surveillance endoscopy with biopsies.
review	Confocal laser endomicroscopy has the potential to eliminate the need for biopsy, establish diagnosis and facilitate application of endoscopic therapy during the time of actual endoscopy.
review	There are several studies that have demonstrated reasonable diagnostic accuracy in patients undergoing surveillance for Barrett's esophagus from tertiary academic medical centers.
review	However, the application of confocal laser endomicroscopy in routine clinical endoscopy is still in the process of refinement.
review	Its role in the diagnosis and treatment of Barrett's-associated dysplasia will continue to evolve with improvement in technology, criteria for diagnosis and experience among endoscopists in interpreting confocal imaging.
review	Application of confocal laser endomicroscopy in the diagnosis and management of Barrett's esophagus
review	Esophageal cancer (EC) generally consists of squamous cell carcinoma (which arise from squamous epithelium) and adenocarcinoma (which arise from columnar epithelium).
review	Due to the increased recognition of risk factors associated with EC and the development of screening programs, there has been an increase in the diagnosis of early EC.
review	Early EC is amenable to curative therapy by endoscopy, which can be performed by either endoscopic resection or endoscopic ablation.
review	Endoscopic resection consists of either endoscopic mucosal resection (preferred in cases of adenocarcinoma) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (preferred in cases of squamous cell carcinoma).
review	Endoscopic ablation can be performed by either radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, argon plasma coagulation or photodynamic therapy, amongst others.
review	Endoscopy can also assist in the management of complications post-esophageal surgery, such as anastomotic leaks and perforations. Finally, there is a growing role for endoscopy to manage end-of-life palliative symptoms, especially dysphagia.
review	The growing use of esophageal stents, debulking therapy and dilation can assist in improving a patient's quality of life. In this review, we examine the multiple roles of endoscopy in the management of patients with EC.
review	Endoscopic management of esophageal cancer
review	Because the esophagus is easily accessible with endoscopy, early diagnosis and curative treatment of esophageal cancer is possible. However, diagnosis is often delayed because symptoms are not specific during early stages of tumor development.
review	The onset of dysphagia is associated with advanced disease, which has a survival at 5 years lower than 15%.
review	Population screening by endoscopy is not cost-effective, but a number of alternative imaging and cell analysis technologies are under investigation. The ideal screening test should be inexpensive, well tolerated, and applicable to primary care.
review	Over the past 10 years, significant progress has been made in endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of dysplasia (squamous and Barrett's), and early esophageal cancer using resection and ablation technologies supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials.
review	We review the state-of-the-art technologies for early diagnosis and minimally invasive treatment, which together could reduce the burden of disease.
review	Endoscopic Management of Early Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus: Screening, Diagnosis, and Therapy
review	Background: Oesophagectomy is one of the most challenging surgeries. Potential for morbidity and mortality is high. Minimally invasive techniques have been introduced in an attempt to reduce postoperative complications and recovery times.
review	Debate continues over whether these techniques are beneficial to morbidity and whether oncological resection is compromised.
review	This review article will analyse the different techniques employed in minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) and critically evaluate commonly reported outcome measures from the available literature.
review	Methods: Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and PubMed databases were used to search English language articles published on MIO. Thirty-one articles underwent thorough analysis and the data were tabulated where appropriate.
review	To date, only level III evidence exists. Where appropriate, comparisons are made with a meta-analysis on open oesophagectomy.
review	Results: Positive aspects of MIO include at least comparable postoperative recovery data and oncological resection measures to open surgery. Intensive care unit requirements are lower, as is duration of inpatient stay. Respiratory morbidity varies.
review	Negative aspects include increased technical skill of the surgeon and increased equipment requirements, increased operative time and limitation with respect to local advancement of cancer.
review	With increasing individual experience, improvements in outcome measures and the amenability of this approach to increasing neoplastic advancement has been shown.
review	Conclusion: MIO has outcome measures at least as comparable to open oesophagectomy in the setting of benign and nonlocally advanced cancer.
review	Transthoracic oesophagectomy provides superior exposure to the thoracic oesophagus compared to the transhiatal approach and is currently preferred. No multicentre randomised controlled trials exist or are likely to come into fruition.
review	As with all surgery, careful patient selection is required for optimal results from MIO.
review	Minimally invasive oesophagectomy: current status and future direction
review	Laparoscopic and thoracoscopic or robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy offers benefits in decreased postoperative complications and faster recovery. The choice of operation depends on patient and surgeon factors.
review	McKeown or 3-field esophagectomy requires dissection in the abdomen, chest, and neck, with a cervical anastomosis. Ivor Lewis esophagectomy is performed with abdominal and right chest dissection and intrathoracic anastomosis.
review	Transhiatal or transmediastinal esophagectomy is performed with abdominal and cervical dissections and a cervical anastomosis and is preferential in patients with significant pulmonary risk factors.
review	Preparation and operative conduct for laparoscopic and robotic approaches for these operations, and the expected postoperative recovery are detailed.
review	Minimally Invasive Esophageal Cancer Surgery
review	There are now a variety of treatment options available to palliate dysphagia in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma.
review	The decision as to which therapy to recommend for a patient should be based on a though understanding of the therapies and must be individualized for each patient and on the experience of the endoscopist or surgeon.
review	In addition, consideration should be given as to resource availability at a particular institution. External beam radiation currently has little role as primary treatment for dysphagia.
review	Brachytherapy is labor intensive; requires 2 to 3 weekly treatments, highly specialized radiation equipment, and an experienced radiation oncologist; and is therefore limited to tertiary care centers.
review	Endoluminal YAG-laser tumor ablation is feasible at many institutions and provides immediate dysphagia relief but has limited durability (weeks) if not followed by adjuvant therapy, and requires an endoscopist with significant laser experience.
review	PDT is relatively easy to perform and has a lower perforation rate and longer durability than YAG laser therapy but it is relatively costly and less patient friendly due to the morbidity of its attendant 6 weeks of photosensitivity.
review	Advances in stent technology have rendered this a safe, readily available treatment for the palliation of dysphagia.
review	Palliation of dysphagia is an important but difficult goal that may require creative use of a variety of endoscopic interventions, either in combination or serially.
review	Ideally, physicians who palliate dysphagia secondary to esophageal cancer should be facile in both endoscopic ablative and stenting techniques and have a close working relationship with both radiation and medical oncologists.
review	Endoluminal palliation for dysphagia secondary to esophageal carcinoma
review	The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased dramatically in the Western population in the last two decades. Many of these patients tend to present late in the disease course with symptoms of dysphagia and malnutrition.
review	Thus a majority of patients at presentation may require palliation of their symptoms. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related mortality in the United States.
review	Similar to esophageal cancer, many patients present in advanced stages where surgical resection for cure may not be an option. Endobronchial obstruction from both primary and metastatic neoplasm causes significant morbidity.
review	The modalities, which are currently available for palliation of symptoms include surgery, photodynamic therapy, dilation, external beam radiation, stents, Nd:YAG laser therapy, and brachytherapy.
review	Each of these modalities has their specific advantages and drawbacks. In this article, we discuss the role of photodynamic therapy in the palliation of esophageal and lung cancer.
review	Role of photodynamic therapy in unresectable esophageal and lung cancer
review	Background: Most patients with oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage and require palliative intervention.
review	Although there are many kinds of interventions, the optimal one for the palliation of dysphagia remains unclear. This review updates the previous version published in 2009.
review	Objectives: The aim of this review was to systematically analyse and summarise the efficacy of different interventions used in the palliation of dysphagia in primary oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal carcinoma.
review	Search methods: To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).
review	Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment.
review	Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head-to-head or in combination, were included.
review	The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30-day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life.
review	Data collection and analysis: Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Main results: We included 3684 patients from 53 studies.
review	SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re-interventions and for adverse effects.
review	Anti-reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti-reflux stents might have reduced gastro-oesophageal reflux and complications.
review	Newly-designed double-layered nitinol (Niti-S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti-S stents.
review	Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy.
review	Authors' conclusions: Self-expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities.
review	However, high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life.
review	Some anti-reflux stents and newly-designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents.
review	Combinations of brachytherapy with self-expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re-interventions.
review	Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia.
review	Interventions for dysphagia in oesophageal cancer
review	Background and aim: Several health economic evaluations have explored the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance for patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, with conflicting results.
review	By comparing results across studies and highlighting key methodological and data limitations a platform for future, more rigorous analyses, can be developed.
review	Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken of studies evaluating cost-effectiveness of surveillance for non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus.
review	Articles were included if they assessed both cost and health outcomes for surveillance versus no surveillance.
review	A descriptive review was undertaken and the quality of the studies appraised against best-practice recommendations for economic evaluations and modeling studies. Results: Seven publications met the inclusion criteria.
review	All used decision-analytic Markov models. Half of the evaluations found surveillance was not cost-effective.
review	At best, surveillance produced improved outcomes at a cost of US$16 640 per quality-adjusted life-year, and at worst it did more harm than good and at a greater cost.
review	The quality of the evaluations and generalizability to the Asia-Pacific region was diminished as a result of inadequate or inconsistent evidence supporting parameter estimates, such as quality of life, endoscopic sensitivity and specificity and cancer recurrence rates.
review	Conclusions: Unless newly emerging technologies improve the quality-adjusted survival benefit conferred by endoscopic surveillance, this strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective.
review	Obsolete assumptions and incomplete analyses reduce the quality of published evaluations.
review	For these reasons new evaluations are required that encompass the growing evidence base for new technologies, such as new endoscopic therapies for high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer.
review	Is endoscopic surveillance for non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus cost-effective? Review of economic evaluations
review	Gastric interposition is usually considered the reconstruction of choice following esophageal resection.
review	However, a number of reports show that esophagectomy followed by a gastric transplant is associated with poor quality of life and significant reflux esophagitis in the esophageal remnant.
review	The aim of this work is to review the factors affecting the mucosa of the esophageal remnant when using the stomach. A Medline was conducted. Additional references and search pathways were sourced from the references of reviewed articles.
review	Reflux disease is considered an unavoidable consequence of esophageal resection followed by gastric interposition. Mucosal damage from acid and bile exposure in the esophageal remnant affects approximatively 50% of these patients.
review	There is usually no correlation between symptoms and the presence of mucosal damage in the remaining esophagus. Endoscopy and endoscopic biopsies are the only reliable methods to document the status of the mucosa.
review	When present, reflux esophagitis shows a progression from inflammation to erosions and to the development of columnar lined metaplasia.
review	Esophageal and gastric function, gastric drainage operation, level of the anastomosis, route of reconstruction, and patients' position after the operation have all been shown to influence the severity and extent of damage in the esophageal remnant.
review	Prevention and treatment of esophagitis in the remaining esophagus are discussed. When the stomach is used as a substitute to reconstruct the esophagus whether for malignant or benign conditions, an in vivo model of reflux diseases is created.
review	Studies using this model may help clarify molecular and cellular events that lead to irreversible insult on the esophageal mucosa. Improvement to the reconstruction itself must be sought to favor better results with the gastric transplant.
review	The esophageal remnant after gastric interposition
Case series	Objective: To assess the outcome of surgical therapy based on a topographic/anatomical classification of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.
Case series	Summary background data: Because of its borderline location between the stomach and esophagus, the choice of surgical strategy for patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction is controversial.
Case series	Methods: In a large single-center series of 1,002 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, the choice of surgical approach was based on the location of the tumor center or tumor mass.
Case series	Treatment of choice was esophagectomy for type I tumors (adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus) and extended gastrectomy for type II tumors (true carcinoma of the cardia) and type III tumors (subcardial gastric cancer infiltrating the distal esophagus).
Case series	Demographic data, morphologic and histopathologic tumor characteristics, and long-term survival rates were compared among the three tumor types, focusing on the pattern of lymphatic spread, the outcome of surgery, and prognostic factors in patients with type II tumors.
Case series	Results: There were marked differences in sex distribution, associated intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus, tumor grading, tumor growth pattern, and stage distribution between the three tumor types.
Case series	The postoperative death rate was higher after esophagectomy than extended total gastrectomy.
Case series	On multivariate analysis, a complete tumor resection (R0 resection) and the lymph node status (pN0) were the dominating independent prognostic factors for the entire patient population and in the three tumor types, irrespective of the surgical approach.
Case series	In patients with type II tumors, the pattern of lymphatic spread was primarily directed toward the paracardial, lesser curvature, and left gastric artery nodes; esophagectomy offered no survival benefit over extended gastrectomy in these patients.
Case series	Conclusion: The classification of adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction into type I, II, and III tumors shows marked differences between the tumor types and provides a useful tool for selecting the surgical approach.
Case series	For patients with type II tumors, esophagectomy offers no advantage over extended gastrectomy if a complete tumor resection can be achieved.
Case series	Adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction: results of surgical therapy based on anatomical/topographic classification in 1,002 consecutive patients
Case series	Introduction: The Siewert classification has been used to plan treatment for tumours of the gastro-oesophageal junction since its proposal in the 1980s.
Case series	The purpose of this study was to assess its continued relevance by evaluating whether there were differences in the biology and clinical characteristics of adenocarcinomas by Siewert type, in a contemporary cohort of patients, in whom the majority had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Case series	Methods: A prospective database was reviewed for all patients who underwent resection from 2005 to 2011 and analysed with regard to Siewert classification determined from the pathological specimen, treatment and clinicopathological outcomes.
Case series	Results: Two hundred and sixteen patients underwent oesophagogastric resection: 133 for type I, 51 for type II and 33 for type III tumours. 135 Patients (62. 5%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with no difference between groups.
Case series	There were no significant differences in age, sex, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage, ASA, or inpatient complications between patients with adenocarcinoma based on their Siewert classification.
Case series	There was a significant increase in maximum tumour diameter (P = 0. 023), perineural invasion (P = 0. 021) and vascular invasion (P = 0. 020), associated with more distal tumours (Type III > Type II > Type I).
Case series	Median overall survival was significantly shorter for more distal tumours (Type I: 4. 96 years vs. Type II: 3. 3 years vs. Type III: 2. 64 years; P = 0. 04). The surgical approach did not influence survival.
Case series	Conclusion: In the era of multi-modal treatment pathological Siewert tumour type is of prognostic value, as patients with Type III disease are likely to have larger and more aggressive tumours that lead to worse outcomes.
Case series	The relevance of the Siewert classification in the era of multimodal therapy for adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction
Case series	The computed tomographic (CT) findings in 52 patients with histologically proved esophageal carcinoma were reviewed. In 30 of these patients, the CT findings were correlated with findings at surgery or autopsy.
Case series	CT was found to be highly accurate in predicting tumor size and assessing invasion of the tracheobronchial tree and spread to the liver, adrenals, and celiac and left gastric nodes.
Case series	By quantifying the contact between the tumor and aorta, it was found that the CT appearance correctly predicted the presence or absence of aortic invasion in 24 of 25 cases (five cases were indeterminate).
Case series	CT was insensitive in detecting metastatic spread to local periesophageal nodes; in these cases the tumor tended to involve the nodes without enlarging them. CT is an accurate method for assessing the spread of esophageal carcinoma.
Case series	Its use can prevent unnecessary surgery in patients with inoperable tumors.
Case series	Computed tomography in the staging of esophageal carcinoma
Case series	Background: Postchemoradiation percentage decrease in standardized uptake value (SUV) of positron emission tomography (PET) from baseline correlates with overall survival (OS) and pathologic response.
Case series	Analyses of dichotomized data are commonly reported. The authors analyzed percentage SUV decrease as both dichotomized and continuous variables.
Case series	Methods: The authors assessed 151 consecutive patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma who had chemoradiation and surgery. Baseline and postchemoradiation PET/computed tomography imaging was performed.
Case series	The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models were used to associate percentage SUV changes and OS, and logistic regression models were used to detect the association between percentage SUV changes and pathologic response.
Case series	Results: A >52% SUV decrease (dichotomized analysis) was associated with a longer OS (log-rank test, P =. 023).
Case series	The univariate Cox proportional hazards model indicated that greater percentage SUV decrease (as a continuous variable) was associated with a lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 99; P =. 01).
Case series	Pathologic response (< or =50% residual cancer) was associated with longer OS (P =. 003).
Case series	Patients with chemoradiation resistance (>50% residual cancer) tended to have a higher risk of death than those with chemoradiation sensitivity (0-50% residual cancer; HR, 2. 12; P =. 099).
Case series	In the multivariate model, the percentage SUV decrease (as a continuous variable) was the only prognosticator of OS (P =. 01).
Case series	The percentage SUV decrease was nonsignificantly associated with pathologic complete response (univariate odds ratio [OR], 1. 01; P =. 06 and multivariate OR, 1. 03; P =. 07).
Case series	Conclusions: The greater the decline in SUV after chemoradiation, the longer is the OS of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma patients.
Case series	The percentage SUV decrease as a continuous variable is a better prognosticator of OS than its dichotomized assessments.
Case series	The higher the decrease in the standardized uptake value of positron emission tomography after chemoradiation, the better the survival of patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma
Case series	Background: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are potential tools for the detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for esophageal cancer.
Case series	This study investigated yield of EUS and FNA for detection of malignant lymph nodes (LNs) after nCRT. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of the preSANO trial. EUS was performed 10 - 12 weeks after nCRT.
Case series	18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography - computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) was used to guide targeting of suspicious LNs. Consecutive FNA sampling was performed for suspicious LNs identified on EUS and/or PET-CT.
Case series	EUS nodal staging was compared with histopathological examination of the resection specimen. The primary outcome was the proportion of correctly identified patients with malignant LNs by radial EUS.
Case series	Results: 101 consecutive patients were included: 79 patients had no malignant LNs, of whom 62 were classified correctly by EUS (specificity 78 %); 22 patients had malignant LNs, of whom 11 were identified (sensitivity 50 %).
Case series	Six of these patients had ≥ 1 suspicious LN not fulfilling EUS criteria (round, hypoechogenic, > 5 mm). Malignant LNs in falsely negative patients were predominantly located at distal LN stations.
Case series	Specificity and sensitivity of conclusive FNA outcomes were 100 % (7/7) and 75 % (3/4), respectively. FNA outcome was uncertain in eight patients, half of whom appeared to have malignant LNs.
Case series	Conclusions: EUS only detected 50 % of patients with malignant LNs 10 - 12 weeks after nCRT. To optimize sensitivity and minimize the risk of missing residual disease, FNA of LNs should be performed even in cases of low endosonographic suspicion.

Case series	Introduction: Both cervical (McKeown) and intrathoracic (Ivor Lewis) anastomosis of transthoracic esophagectomy are surgical procedures that can be performed for distal esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.
Case series	The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) after McKeown and Ivor Lewis esophagectomy in a tertiary referral center.
Case series	Methods: Disease-free patients >1 year following a McKeown or an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with a two-field lymphadenectomy for a distal or GEJ carcinoma visiting the outpatient clinic between 2014 and 2018 were asked to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-OG25 questionnaires.
Case series	HR-QoL was investigated in both groups. Results: A total of 89 patients were included after McKeown and 115 after Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. Median follow-up was 2. 4 years (IQR 1. 7-3. 6).
Case series	Patients after McKeown esophagectomy reported more problems with 'eating with others' compared to patients after Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (mean scores: 49. 9 vs. 38. 8).
Case series	This difference was both clinically relevant and significant after correction for multiple testing (β = 11. 1, 95% CI 3. 105-19. 127, P = 0. 042).
Case series	Patients in both groups reported a poorer HR-QoL (≥10 points) than the general population with respect to nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, appetite loss, financial difficulties, problems with eating, reflux, eating with others, choked when swallowing, trouble with coughing, and weight loss.
Case series	Conclusion: Long-term HR-QoL of disease-free patients following a McKeown or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for a distal or GEJ carcinoma is largely comparable. Irrespective of the surgical technique, patients' HR-QoL following esophagectomy is compromised.
Case series	When given the choice, patients should be informed that after a McKeown esophagectomy more problems while eating with others can occur.

Case series	Background: Surgery for early esophageal carcinoma has been challenged by less invasive endoscopic approaches. Selecting patients in need for surgical intervention according to their risk of lymphatic spread is mandatory.
Case series	Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for lymphatic metastasis formation in T1b esophageal carcinomas.
Case series	Methods: Histopathological specimens following surgical resection for T1b esophageal carcinomas were reevaluated for overall submucosal layer thickness, depth of submucosal tumor infiltration, tumor length as well as lymphatic and vascular infiltration.
Case series	Depth of tumor infiltration to overall submucosal thickness was divided in thirds (SM1, SM2, and SM3) and factors influencing lymphatic metastasis formation were assessed.
Case series	Results: A total of 67 patients with pT1b tumors were analyzed, including 36 adenocarcinomas (53. 7 %) and 31 squamous cell carcinomas (46. 3 %). Lymph node involvement was seen in 22.
Case series	4 % (15/67) patients without significant differences between SM1 3/11 (27. 3 %), SM2, 4/18 (22. 2 %), and SM3 (8/38) (21. 8 %) (p = 0. 909) carcinomas.
Case series	On binomial log-regression models, only lymphangioinvasion and tumor length >2 cm was significantly associated with lymph node involvement.
Case series	Conclusion: As depth of submucosal tumor infiltration did not correlate with the formation of lymph node metastases and in regard of the risk of lymphatic spread in these cases, surgical resection is warranted in pT1b carcinomas.

Case series	Aims: The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of computed tomography (CT)-guided125 I brachytherapy for pain palliation in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases.
Case series	Materials and methods: A total of 23 patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and those who had moderate-to-severe pain from January 2014 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study.
Case series	The primary tumors included pancreatic (n = 12), gastric (n = 4), hepatocellular (n = 4), colorectal (n = 2), and esophageal carcinomas (n= 1). Patients were treated with CT-guided percutaneous125 I brachytherapy during the study.
Case series	The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was used to record and compare pain intensity and interference by pain.
Case series	Treatment-related complications were also evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria.
Case series	Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22. 0. Results: The primary success rate of125 I seed implantation was 95. 7% (22 of the 23 patients).
Case series	As pain evolved, the patients achieved obvious pain palliation ratings for "worst pain" and "average pain" at 72 h and 4 weeks after brachytherapy, respectively, whereas "pain right now" at 12 weeks was significantly relieved after brachytherapy.
Case series	No serious complications developed during the perioperative period.
Case series	Conclusions: In the treatment of intractable carcinomatous pain in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, CT-guided125 I brachytherapy is a feasible and effective modality for pain palliation.

Case series	Purpose: To analyze factors influencing the efficacy of 125I seed implantation in the treatment of in-field cervical lymph node recurrence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after external beam radiation therapy.
Case series	Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 36 patients with in-field cervical metastatic lymph nodes recurrence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (CML-ESCC) after external beam radiation therapy treatment, who underwent 125I seed implantation in our department from 2013 to 2019.
Case series	Previous cumulative external irradiation dose ranged from 20 to 66 Gy (median, 60 Gy). The post-implant efficacy was evaluated by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.
Case series	1, and an adverse event was evaluated by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Score (EORTC).
Case series	COX proportional hazards model was used to analyze risk factors affecting effectiveness. Results: Among 36 patients, 31 patients (86. 1%) received fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) after 125I seed implantation.
Case series	Local control rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation were 51%, 30%, 30%, and 18%, respectively, with a median of 9 months (95% CI: 6. 106-11.
Case series	894); survival rates after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 55%, 41%, 22%, and 22%, respectively, with a median of 8 months (95% CI: 5. 753-10. 247).
Case series	Multivariate analysis showed that D90 and short-term efficacy were independent factors related to local control and survival rate (p = 0. 005, < 0. 001, 0. 010, < 0. 001). There were 2 cases (5. 6%) with grade 1 skin toxicity, 1 case (2.
Case series	8%) with grade 4 skin toxicity, 3 cases (8. 3%) with grade 1 mucosal ulcer, and 3 cases (8. 3%) with grade 1 xerostomia.

Cross-sectional study	Background: Incidence rates for esophageal adenocarcinoma previously were reported to be increasing rapidly, especially among white males. Rates for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma also were observed to be rising, although less rapidly.
Cross-sectional study	In this article, the authors update the incidence trends through 1994 and further consider the trends by age group.
Cross-sectional study	Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data were used to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates for esophageal carcinoma by histologic type and gastric adenocarcinoma by anatomic subsite.
Cross-sectional study	Results: Among white males, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus rose > 350% since the mid-1970s, surpassing squamous cell carcinoma around 1990. Rates also rose among black males, but remained at much lower levels.
Cross-sectional study	To a lesser extent, there were continuing increases in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma among white and black males, which nearly equaled the rates for noncardia tumors of the stomach in white men.
Cross-sectional study	The upward trend for both tumors was much greater among older than younger men. Although the incidence also rose among females, rates remained much lower than among males.
Cross-sectional study	Conclusions: Previously reported increases of esophageal adenocarcinoma are continuing, most notably among white males.
Cross-sectional study	Cigarette smoking may contribute to the trend through an early stage carcinogenic effect, along with obesity, which may increase intraabdominal pressure and predispose to gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Cross-sectional study	Further research into esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is needed to clarify the risk factors and mechanisms responsible for the upward trends as well as the racial and gender disparities in incidence.

Case series	Objectives: To substantiate reports of increasing proportions of gastric adenocarcinoma of diffuse histologic type and in the proximal portion of the stomach, to better understand the prognostic features that govern survival, and to determine whether alterations of operative strategy might improve the surgical results.
Case series	Design: Retrospective analysis of 289 consecutive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma operated on by general surgeons over a 26-year period.
Case series	Records were reviewed for location, histologic type, resection, operative mortality, lymph node status, and outcome. Setting: The Section of Surgical Oncology, the New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, Mass.
Case series	Main outcome measures: Survival rate, length of life of the patients who died, and operative mortality. Results: A marked and significant shift of gastric adenocarcinoma to a proximal location (54% between 1985 and 1990) occurred over 26 years (P =.
Case series	0075) with a significant stage improvement at presentation (P =. 0235). Percentages of cancers that were of the diffuse, poorly differentiated histologic type increased to 48%.
Case series	More curative operations were performed in the last period (61%), and this upward trend from 37% was significant.
Case series	Proximal gastric cancers had a poorer prognosis with more operative deaths, more lymph node metastases, and worse survival rates than distal cancers.
Case series	Poor survival rates occurred even when comparing patients with negative lymph nodes or favorable histologic features with patients with similar distal cancers.
Case series	Conclusions: Despite significant increases in the proportion of proximal cancers, survival rates have improved only slightly.
Case series	Nodal status plays a less prognostic role than does location or histologic type but does provide prognostic information for individual locations.
Case series	Survival rates for diffuse histologic cancer were consistently worse than those for intestinal histologic cancer, which emphasizes the underlying disease biology controlling outcome.
Case series	Radical lymphadenectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma would not improve surgical outcome in the United States.
Case series	Shifting proportions of gastric adenocarcinomas
Case series	Background: Adenocarcinomas of the distal third of the oesophagus and the gastric cardia have similar characteristics but different staging criteria are being used.
Case series	In the present study the question is addressed whether these tumours should be regarded and staged as one clinical entity.
Case series	Methods: From January 1987 to January 1997, 252 patients with an adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (n = 111) or gastric cardia (n = 141) underwent transhiatal resection.
Case series	Pathology, pathological tumour node metastasis (pTNM) stage and survival were analysed retrospectively, and a comparison was made between tumours of the oesophagus and gastric cardia.
Case series	Results: Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 54 per cent of oesophageal adenocarcinomas compared with 13 per cent of adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia (P < 0. 001).
Case series	Oesophageal carcinomas had a more favourable pT stage, fewer positive locoregional lymph nodes (pN1-2 56 versus 62 per cent; P = 0.
Case series	3), but more distant metastases accounted for by positive lymph nodes around the coeliac axis (pM1 19 versus 4 per cent; P < 0. 001). Five-year overall survival (26 versus 27 per cent; P = 0.
Case series	9) and survival according to tumour stage were no different between the groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the location of the primary tumour was not an independent prognostic factor.
Case series	Conclusion: Adenocarcinomas of the distal oesophagus and gastric cardia should be regarded as one clinical entity. Uniform staging criteria for both malignancies are recommended.
Case series	Adenocarcinomas of the distal oesophagus and gastric cardia are one clinical entity. Rotterdam Oesophageal Tumour Study Group
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We report the results of a prospectively randomized study that compared the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin, and protracted venous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) (ECF regimen) with the standard combination of 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) in previously untreated patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Two hundred seventy-four patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized and analyzed for survival, tumor response, toxicity, and quality of life (QL).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The overall response rate was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36% to 54%) with ECF and 21% (95% CI, 13% to 29%) with FAMTX (P =. 0002). Toxicity was tolerable and there were only three toxic deaths.
randomized controlled trial	The FAMTX regimen caused more hematologic toxicity and serious infections, but ECF caused more emesis and alopecia. The median survival duration was 8. 9 months with ECF and 5. 7 months with FAMTX (P =.
randomized controlled trial	0009); at 1 year, 36% (95% CI, 27% to 45%) of ECF and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%) of FAMTX patients were alive. The median failure-free survival duration was 7. 4 months with ECF and 3. 4 months with FAMTX (P =. 00006).
randomized controlled trial	The global QL scores were better for ECF at 24 weeks, but the remaining QL data showed no differences between either arm of the study.
randomized controlled trial	Hospital-based cost analysis on a subset of patients was similar for each arm and translated into an increment cost of $975 per life-year gained.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The ECF regimen results in a survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity, better QL and cost-effectiveness compared with FAMTX chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	This regimen should now be considered the standard treatment for advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized trial comparing epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil versus fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and methotrexate in advanced esophagogastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We report the results of a prospectively randomized study that compared the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin, and protracted venous-infusion fluorouracil (PVI 5-FU) (ECF) with the combination of mitomycin, cisplatin, and PVI 5-FU (MCF) in previously untreated patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Five hundred eighty patients with adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized to receive either ECF (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks and PVI 5-FU 200 mg/m(2)/d) or MCF (mitomycin 7 mg/m(2) every 6 weeks, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, and PVI 5-FU 300 mg/m(2)/d) and analyzed for survival, response, toxicity, and quality of life (QOL).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The overall response rate was 42. 4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37% to 48%) with ECF and 44. 1% (95% CI, 38% to 50%) with MCF (P =. 692). Toxicity was tolerable, and there were only two toxic deaths.
randomized controlled trial	ECF resulted in more grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 2 alopecia, but MCF caused more thrombocytopenia and plantar-palmar erythema. Median survival was 9. 4 months with ECF and 8. 7 months with MCF (P =. 315); at 1 year, 40.
randomized controlled trial	2% (95% CI, 34% to 46%) of ECF and 32. 7% (95% CI, 27% to 38%) of MCF patients were alive. Median failure-free survival was 7 months with both regimens. Global QOL scores were better with ECF at 3 and 6 months.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: This study confirms response, survival, and QOL benefits of ECF observed in a previous randomized study. The equivalent efficacy of MCF was demonstrated, but QOL was superior with ECF.
randomized controlled trial	ECF remains one of the reference treatments for advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Prospective randomized trial comparing mitomycin, cisplatin, and protracted venous-infusion fluorouracil (PVI 5-FU) With epirubicin, cisplatin, and PVI 5-FU in advanced esophagogastric cancer
meta analysis	Background: It is unclear if differential chemotherapy effects exist on overall survival (OS), response rate (RR) and toxicity depending on primary tumour origin [oesophageal versus oesophago-gastric junction (OGJ) versus gastric adenocarcinoma].
meta analysis	Patients and methods: A total of 2110 patients were enrolled in four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing fluoropyrimidine +/- platinum-based chemotherapy.
meta analysis	This analysis used individual patient data and restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma who received one or more dose of chemotherapy. Gastric origin was the control in comparisons of tumour origin.
meta analysis	Results: Of the 2110 patients randomised, 1775 (84%) patients had adenocarcinoma with oesophageal (n = 485), OGJ (n = 457) and gastric (n = 833) origins. The median OS was 9. 5 months in oesophageal, 9. 3 months in OGJ and 8.
meta analysis	7 months in gastric cancer (P = 0. 68). RR was 44. 1% in oesophageal, 41. 1% in OGJ and 35. 6% in gastric cancers (P = 0. 11 and 0. 27, respectively, compared with gastric cancer on multivariate analysis).
meta analysis	Toxicity composite end point occurred in 46%, 47% and 45% in oesophageal, OGJ and gastric cancers, respectively (P = 0. 85 and 0. 62 compared with gastric).
meta analysis	Conclusions: In our large multicentre RCT dataset, no significant differences were demonstrated on multivariate analyses in OS, RR and toxic effects among patients with advanced oesophageal, OGJ and gastric adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	Future RCTs should not exclude oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
meta analysis	The impact of primary tumour origins in patients with advanced oesophageal, oesophago-gastric junction and gastric adenocarcinoma--individual patient data from 1775 patients in four randomised controlled trials
meta analysis	Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) account for >95% of esophageal malignancies and represent a major global health burden.
meta analysis	ESCC is the dominant histology globally but represents a minority of U. S. cases, with EAC accounting for the majority of U. S. Cases: The patient outcomes for advanced ESCC and EAC are poor, and new therapeutic options are needed.
meta analysis	Using a sensitive sequencing assay, we compared the genomic profiles of ESCC and EAC with attention to identification of therapeutically relevant genomic alterations.
meta analysis	Methods: Next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a median coverage depth of >650× for all coding exons of 315 cancer-related genes plus selected introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.
meta analysis	Results from a single sample were evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GAs) including point mutations, short insertions and deletions, gene amplifications, homozygous deletions, and fusions/rearrangements.
meta analysis	Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGAs) were defined as alterations linked to approved drugs and those under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials.
meta analysis	Results: There were no significant differences by sex for either tumor type, and the median age for all patients was 63 years. All ESCCs and EACs were at an advanced stage at the time of sequencing.
meta analysis	All 71 ESCCs and 231 EACs featured GAs on profiling, with 522 GAs in ESCC (7. 4 per sample) and 1,303 GAs in EAC (5. 6 per sample). The frequency of clinically relevant GAs in ESCC was 94% (2. 6 per sample) and 93% in EAC (2. 7 per sample).
meta analysis	CRGAs occurring more frequently in EAC included KRAS (23% EAC vs. 6% ESCC) and ERBB2 (23% EAC vs. 3% ESCC). ESCC samples were enriched for CRGA in PIK3CA (24% ESCC vs. 10% EAC), PTEN (11% ESCC vs. 4% EAC), and NOTCH1 (17% ESCC vs. 3% EAC).
meta analysis	Other GAs that differed significantly between histologic tumor types included SMAD4 (14% EAC vs. 1% ESCC), RB1 (14% ESCC vs. 2% EAC), SOX2 (18% ESCC vs. 1% EAC), and NFE2L2 (24% ESCC vs. 1% EAC).
meta analysis	Conclusion: ESCC and EAC share similarly high frequencies of overall and clinically relevant genomic alterations; however, the profiles of genomic alterations in the two diseases differ widely, with KRAS and ERBB2 far more frequently altered in EAC compared with ESCC and with mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway genes (PIK3CA and PTEN) and NOTCH1 more frequently altered in ESCC compared with EAC.
meta analysis	Comprehensive genomic profiling highlights the promise of identifying clinically relevant genomic alterations in both ESCC and EAC and suggests new avenues for molecularly directed therapies in esophageal cancer.
meta analysis	Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Esophageal Adenocarcinomas Reveals Similarities and Differences
randomized controlled trial	A phase III randomised study, comparing treatment with fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and methotrexate (FEMTX) with the best supportive care, was conducted in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	During the period from July 1986 to June 1992, 41 patients were randomised to receive FEMTX or best supportive care. MTX was given in a dose of 1500 mg m-2 intravenously (i. v. ) followed after 1 h by 5-FU 1500 mg m-2 i. v.
randomized controlled trial	on day 1; leucovorin rescue was started after 24 h (30 mg orally every 6 h for 48 h) and epidoxorubicin 60 mg m-2 i. v. was administered on day 15. In addition both groups received tablets containing vitamins A and E.
randomized controlled trial	Response rates for FEMTX were as follows: complete response (CR), 19% (4/21); partial response (PR), 10% (2/21); no change (NC), 33% (7/21); and progressive disease (PD), 24% (5/21).
randomized controlled trial	Response rates in the control group were: NC, 20% (4/20); and PD, 80% (16/20). Increased pain was observed in one patient in the treated group and in 11 patients in the control group within the first 2 months.
randomized controlled trial	WHO grade III/IV toxicity in the chemotherapy group was as follows: nausea/vomiting 40%, diarrhoea 10%, stomatitis 15%, leucopenia 50% and thrombocytopenia 10%. One possible treatment-related death was due to sepsis.
randomized controlled trial	The median time to progression in the FEMTX group was 5. 4 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3. 1-11. 7 months], but only 1. 7 months in the control group (95% CI 1. 2-2. 7 months) (P = 0. 0013).
randomized controlled trial	Similarly, the FEMTX group displayed significantly (P = 0. 0006) prolonged survival compared with the control group, i. e. median survival 12. 3 months (95% CI 7. 1-15. 6 months) vs 3. 1 months (95% CI 1. 6-4. 6 months).
randomized controlled trial	In conclusion, FEMTX combined with vitamin A and E is a fairly well-tolerated treatment, giving a response rate of 29% in patients with advanced gastric cancer, and also prolonging patients' survival.
randomized controlled trial	It can be used as a reference treatment in testing new investigational combinations.
randomized controlled trial	Randomised comparison of fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and methotrexate (FEMTX) plus supportive care with supportive care alone in patients with non-resectable gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: The extent to which chemotherapy may relieve tumour-related symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival in patients with gastric cancer is not known in spite of the extensive use of this treatment modality.
randomized controlled trial	The aim of this study was to estimate any gain in the quantity and quality of life produced by chemotherapy in these patients.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Between January 1991 and February 1995, 61 patients with gastric cancer were randomized to either chemotherapy in addition to best supportive care or to best supportive care.
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy was allowed in the latter group if the supportive measures did not lead to palliation.
randomized controlled trial	Chemotherapy was the ELF-regimen consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and etoposide, or, in elderly patients with poor performance, a 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen (FLv). Quality of life was evaluated with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 instrument.
randomized controlled trial	Results: More patients in the chemotherapy group (45%, 14/31) had an improved or prolonged high quality of life for a minimum period of 4 months compared to those in the best supportive care group (20%, 6/30, P < 0. 05).
randomized controlled trial	A similar difference was seen in the treating physician's evaluation of whether the patient was subjectively improved or continued to do well for at least 4 months (17/31, 55% versus 6/30, 20%, P < 0. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was longer in the chemotherapy group (median 8 vs. 5 months) although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 12).
randomized controlled trial	After corrections for imbalances in pretreatment characteristics, chemotherapy treatment was, however, associated with a survival benefit (P = 0. 003).
randomized controlled trial	Also, the quality-adjusted survival time and time to disease progression were longer for patients randomized to chemotherapy (median 5 vs. 2 months, P = 0. 03).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: The results show that chemotherapy can add to both quantity and quality of life in advanced gastric cancer. The number of patients who benefit from treatment is, however, still rather limited.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized comparison between chemotherapy plus best supportive care with best supportive care in advanced gastric cancer
meta analysis	Purpose: This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Methods: Randomized phase II and III clinical trials on first-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer were identified by electronic searches of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Cancerlit; hand searches of relevant abstract books and reference lists; and contact to experts.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis was performed using the fixed-effect model. Overall survival, reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI, was the primary outcome measure. Results: Analysis of chemotherapy versus best supportive care (HR = 0. 39; 95% CI, 0. 28 to 0.
meta analysis	52) and combination versus single agent, mainly fluorouracil (FU) -based chemotherapy (HR = 0. 83; 95% CI = 0. 74 to 0. 93) showed significant overall survival benefits in favor of chemotherapy and combination chemotherapy, respectively.
meta analysis	In addition, comparisons of FU/cisplatin-containing regimens with versus without anthracyclines (HR = 0. 77; 95% CI, 0. 62 to 0. 95) and FU/anthracycline-containing combinations with versus without cisplatin (HR = 0. 83; 95% CI, 0. 76 to 0.
meta analysis	91) both demonstrated a significant survival benefit for the three-drug combination.
meta analysis	Comparing irinotecan-containing versus nonirinotecan-containing combinations (mainly FU/cisplatin) resulted in a nonsignificant survival benefit in favor of the irinotecan-containing regimens (HR = 0. 88; 95% CI, 0. 73 to 1.
meta analysis	06), but they have never been compared against a three-drug combination. Conclusion: Best survival results are achieved with three-drug regimens containing FU, an anthracycline, and cisplatin.
meta analysis	Among these, regimens including FU as bolus exhibit a higher rate of toxic deaths than regimens using a continuous infusion of FU, such as epirubicin, cisplatin, and continuous-infusion FU.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis based on aggregate data
randomized controlled trial	Background: A globally accepted standard first-line chemotherapy regimen in advanced esophagogastric cancer (AEGC) is not clearly established.
randomized controlled trial	We conducted a systematic review to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line chemotherapy using Network meta-analysis (NMA).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and conferences were searched until June 2015 for randomized controlled trials that compared regimens containing: fluoropyrimidine (F), platinum (cisplatin [C] and oxaliplatin [Ox]), taxane (T), anthracycline (A), irinotecan (I), or methotrexate (M).
randomized controlled trial	Direct and indirect evidence for overall survival (OS) and progression-free-survival (PFS) were combined using random-effects NMA on the hazard ratio (HR) scale and calculated as combined hazard ratios and 95% credible intervals (CrIs).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The NMA incorporated 17 chemotherapy regimens with 37 direct comparisons between regimens for OS (50 studies, n = 10 249) and 29 direct comparisons for PFS (34 studies, n = 7795).
randomized controlled trial	Combining direct and indirect effects showed increased efficacy for fluoropyrimidine noncisplatin doublets (F-doublets) over cisplatin doublets (C-doublets): FI vs CF (combined HR = 0. 85, 95% CrI = 0. 71 to 0. 99), FOx vs CF (combined HR = 0.
randomized controlled trial	83, 95% CrI = 0. 71 to 0. 98) in OS and FOx vs CF (combined HR = 0. 82, 95% CrI = 0. 66 to 0. 99) in PFS. Anthracycline-containing triplets (A-triplets: ACF, AFOx, AFM) and TCF triplet showed no benefit over F-doublets in OS and PFS.
randomized controlled trial	The triplet FOxT showed increased PFS vs F-doublets FT (combined HR = 0. 61, 95% CrI = 0. 38 to 0. 99), FI (combined HR = 0. 62, 95% CrI = 0. 38 to 0. 99), and FOx (combined HR = 0. 67, 95% CrI = 0. 44 to 0. 99).
randomized controlled trial	Increased grade 3 to 4 toxicity was found for CF vs F-doublets, for ACF vs FI for TCF vs CF, and for FOxT vs FOx.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Based on efficacy and toxicity, F-doublets FOx, FI, and FT are preferred as first-line treatment for AEGC compared with C-doublets, A-triplets, and TCF. FOxT is the most promising triplet.
randomized controlled trial	The Efficacy and Safety of First-line Chemotherapy in Advanced Esophagogastric Cancer: A Network Meta-analysis
meta analysis	Background: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. In "Western" countries, most people are either diagnosed at an advanced stage, or develop a relapse after surgery with curative intent.
meta analysis	In people with advanced disease, significant benefits from targeted therapies are currently limited to HER-2 positive disease treated with trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, in first-line.
meta analysis	In second-line, ramucirumab, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, demonstrated significant survival benefits. Thus, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Uncertainty remains regarding the choice of the regimen.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the efficacy of chemotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC), combination versus single-agent chemotherapy and different chemotherapy combinations in advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase up to June 2016, reference lists of studies, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We considered only RCTs on systemic, intravenous or oral chemotherapy versus BSC, combination versus single-agent chemotherapy and different chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently identified studies and extracted data. A third investigator was consulted in case of disagreements. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.
meta analysis	Main results: We included 64 RCTs, of which 60 RCTs (11,698 participants) provided data for the meta-analysis of overall survival. We found chemotherapy extends overall survival (OS) by approximately 6. 7 months more than BSC (hazard ratio (HR) 0.
meta analysis	3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0. 24 to 0. 55, 184 participants, three studies, moderate-quality evidence). Combination chemotherapy extends OS slightly (by an additional month) versus single-agent chemotherapy (HR 0. 84, 95% CI 0. 79 to 0.
meta analysis	89, 4447 participants, 23 studies, moderate-quality evidence), which is partly counterbalanced by increased toxicity.
meta analysis	The benefit of epirubicin in three-drug combinations, in which cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU is replaced by capecitabine is unknown. Irinotecan extends OS slightly (by an additional 1.
meta analysis	6 months) versus non-irinotecan-containing regimens (HR 0. 87, 95% CI 0. 80 to 0. 95, 2135 participants, 10 studies, high-quality evidence). Docetaxel extends OS slightly (just over one month) compared to non-docetaxel-containing regimens (HR 0.
meta analysis	86, 95% CI 0. 78 to 0. 95, 2001 participants, eight studies, high-quality evidence).
meta analysis	However, due to subgroup analyses, we are uncertain whether docetaxel-containing combinations (docetaxel added to a single-agent or two-drug combination) extends OS due to moderate-quality evidence (HR 0. 80, 95% CI 0. 71 to 0.
meta analysis	91, 1466 participants, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). When another chemotherapy was replaced by docetaxel, there is probably little or no difference in OS (HR 1. 05; 0. 87 to 1.
meta analysis	27, 479 participants, three studies, moderate-quality evidence). We found there is probably little or no difference in OS when comparing capecitabine versus 5-FU-containing regimens (HR 0. 94, 95% CI 0. 79 to 1.
meta analysis	11, 732 participants, five studies, moderate-quality evidence). Oxaliplatin may extend (by less than one month) OS versus cisplatin-containing regimens (HR 0. 81, 95% CI 0. 67 to 0. 98, 1105 participants, five studies, low-quality evidence).
meta analysis	We are uncertain whether taxane-platinum combinations with (versus without) fluoropyrimidines extend OS due to very low-quality evidence (HR 0. 86, 95% CI 0. 71 to 1. 06, 482 participants, three studies, very low-quality evidence).
meta analysis	S-1 regimens improve OS slightly (by less than an additional month) versus 5-FU-containing regimens (HR 0. 91, 95% CI 0. 83 to 1.
meta analysis	00, 1793 participants, four studies, high-quality evidence), however since S-1 is used in different doses and schedules between Asian and non-Asian population, the applicability of this finding to individual populations is uncertain.
meta analysis	Authors' conclusions: Chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional 6. 7 months) in comparison to BSC, and combination chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional month) compared to single-agent 5-FU.
meta analysis	Testing all patients for HER-2 status may help to identify patients with HER-2-positive tumours, for whom, in the absence of contraindications, trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine or 5-FU in combination with cisplatin has been shown to be beneficial.
meta analysis	For HER-2 negative people, all different two-and three-drug combinations including irinotecan, docetaxel, oxaliplatin or oral 5-FU prodrugs are valid treatment options for advanced gastric cancer, and consideration of the side effects of each regimen is essential in the treatment decision.
meta analysis	Irinotecan-containing combinations and docetaxel-containing combinations (in which docetaxel was added to a single-agent or two-drug (platinum/5-FUcombination) show significant survival benefits in the comparisons studied above.
meta analysis	Furthermore, docetaxel-containing three-drug regimens have increased response rates, but the advantages of the docetaxel-containing three-drug combinations (DCF, FLO-T) are counterbalanced by increased toxicity.
meta analysis	Additionally, oxaliplatin-containing regimens demonstrated a benefit in OS as compared to the same regimen containing cisplatin, and there is a modest survival improvement of S-1 compared to 5-FU-containing regimens.
meta analysis	Whether the survival benefit for three-drug combinations including cisplatin, 5-FU, and epirubicin as compared to the same regimen without epirubicin is still valid when second-line therapy is routinely administered and when cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5-FU by capecitabine is questionable.
meta analysis	Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed survival benefits for the three-drug regimens is not large enough to be clinically meaningful as defined recently by the American Society for Clinical Oncology (Ellis 2014).
meta analysis	In contrast to the comparisons in which a survival benefit was observed by adding a third drug to a two-drug regimen at the cost of increased toxicity, the comparison of regimens in which another chemotherapy was replaced by irinotecan was associated with a survival benefit (of borderline statistical significance), but without increased toxicity.
meta analysis	For this reason irinotecan/5-FU-containing combinations are an attractive option for first-line treatment.
meta analysis	Although they need to be interpreted with caution, subgroup analyses of one study suggest that elderly people have a greater benefit form oxaliplatin, as compared to cisplatin-based regimens, and that people with locally advanced disease or younger than 65 years might benefit more from a three-drug regimen including 5-FU, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin as compared to a two-drug combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatin, a hypothesis that needs further confirmation.
meta analysis	For people with good performance status, the benefit of second-line chemotherapy has been established in several RCTs.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer
meta analysis	Background: Almost half of people with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy and targeted therapies are increasingly used with a palliative intent to control tumor growth, improve quality of life, and prolong survival.
meta analysis	To date, and with the exception of ramucirumab, evidence for the efficacy of palliative treatments for esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer is lacking.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the effects of cytostatic or targeted therapy for treating esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer with palliative intent.
meta analysis	Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, PubMed Publisher, Google Scholar, and trial registries up to 13 May 2015, and we handsearched the reference lists of studies.
meta analysis	We did not restrict the search to publications in English. Additional searches were run in September 2017 prior to publication, and they are listed in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy versus best supportive care or control in people with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of eligible studies according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
meta analysis	We calculated pooled estimates of effect using an inverse variance random-effects model for meta-analysis. Main results: We identified 41 RCTs with 11,853 participants for inclusion in the review as well as 49 ongoing studies.
meta analysis	For the main comparison of adding a cytostatic and/or targeted agent to a control arm, we included 11 studies with 1347 participants.
meta analysis	This analysis demonstrated an increase in overall survival in favor of the arm with an additional cytostatic or targeted therapeutic agent with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 68 to 0. 84, high-quality evidence).
meta analysis	The median increased survival time was one month. Five studies in 750 participants contributed data to the comparison of palliative therapy versus best supportive care.
meta analysis	We found a benefit in overall survival in favor of the group receiving palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy compared to best supportive care (HR 0. 81, 95% CI 0. 71 to 0. 92, high-quality evidence).
meta analysis	Subcomparisons including only people receiving second-line therapies, chemotherapies, targeted therapies, adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas all showed a similar benefit.
meta analysis	The only individual agent that more than one study found to improve both overall survival and progression-free survival was ramucirumab.
meta analysis	Palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy increased the frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicity. However, treatment-related deaths did not occur more frequently.
meta analysis	Quality of life often improved in the arm with an additional agent. Authors' conclusions: People who receive more chemotherapeutic or targeted therapeutic agents have an increased overall survival compared to people who receive less.
meta analysis	These agents, administered as both first-line or second-line treatments, also led to better overall survival than best supportive care. With the exception of ramucirumab, it remains unclear which other individual agents cause the survival benefit.
meta analysis	Although treatment-associated toxicities of grade 3 or more occurred more frequently in arms with an additional chemotherapy or targeted therapy agent, there is no evidence that palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy decrease quality of life.
meta analysis	Based on this meta-analysis, palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy can be considered standard care for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.
meta analysis	Palliative chemotherapy and targeted therapies for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer
meta analysis	Background: Palliative systemic therapy can prolong life and reduce tumor-related symptoms for patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer. However, side effects of treatment could negatively affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
meta analysis	Our aim was to review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis to examine the effect of palliative systemic therapy on HRQoL.
meta analysis	Methods: EMBASE, Medline, and Central were searched for phase II/III randomized controlled trials until April 2018 investigating palliative systemic therapy and HRQoL.
meta analysis	Meta-analysis was performed on baseline and follow-up summary values of global health status (GHS) and other European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer scales.
meta analysis	A clinically relevant change and difference of 10 points (scale 0-100) was set to assess the course of HRQoL over time within treatment arms as well as between arms. Results: We included 43 randomized controlled trials (N = 13 727 patients).
meta analysis	In the first-line and beyond first-line treatment setting, pooled baseline GHS mean estimates were 54. 6 (95% confidence interval = 51. 9 to 57. 3) and 57. 9 (95% confidence interval = 55. 7 to 60. 1), respectively. Thirty-nine (81.
meta analysis	3%) treatment arms showed a stable GHS over the course of time. Anthracycline-based triplets, fluoropyrimidine-based doublets without cisplatin, and the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy were found to have favorable HRQoL outcomes.
meta analysis	HRQoL benefit was observed for taxane monotherapy and several targeted agents over best supportive care beyond first line. Conclusions: Patients reported impaired GHS at baseline and generally remained stable over time.
meta analysis	Anthracycline-based triplets and fluoropyrimidine-based doublets without cisplatin may be preferable first-line treatment options regarding HRQoL for HER2-negative disease.
meta analysis	Taxanes and targeted agents could provide HRQoL benefit beyond first line compared with best supportive care.
meta analysis	Quality of Life During Palliative Systemic Therapy for Esophagogastric Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
randomized controlled trial	Although malnutrition is known to be frequent in cancer patients, it has not been described in a selected population of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies under chemotherapy only.
randomized controlled trial	Physician judgment about malnutrition and risk factors for malnutrition were also evaluated.
randomized controlled trial	All consecutive in- and outpatients of 11 centers were prospectively enrolled in a cross-sectional 14-day period study and classified according to the French health recommendations [Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)].
randomized controlled trial	Among 313 patients enrolled in 11 centers (mean age = 63 yr; range = 21-93; 67% male) mainly with colorectal (58%), pancreatic (15%), gastric (11%), and hepatobiliary (10%) primary tumors, the prevalence of malnutrition was 52%.
randomized controlled trial	Moderate and severe malnutrition was present in 27% and 25% of cases, respectively. Physicians considered it in 36% and 6% of cases, respectively, thereby misclassifying 134 patients (43%).
randomized controlled trial	The agreement between the HAS definition and the physicians' judgment was very low (κ = 0. 30). Most of the patients who were identified as severely malnourished received no nutritional support.
randomized controlled trial	Performance status and pancreatic and gastric cancers were independently associated with malnutrition. Malnutrition levels are high, around 50%, unequally distributed according to the primitive tumor. It is still underestimated by physicians.
randomized controlled trial	Weight loss remains a clinically relevant, simple, and reliable marker of malnutrition.
randomized controlled trial	Malnutrition is high and underestimated during chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer: an AGEO prospective cross-sectional multicenter study
review	Oesophageal cancer is a debilitating disease with a poor prognosis, and weight loss owing to malnutrition prevails in the majority of patients.
review	Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the loss of fat and skeletal muscle mass and systemic inflammation arising from complex host-tumour interactions is a major contributor to malnutrition, which is a determinant of tolerance to treatment and survival.
review	In patients with oesophageal cancer, cachexia is further compounded by eating difficulties owing to the stage and location of the tumour, and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy.
review	Treatment with curative intent involves exceptionally extensive and invasive surgery, and the subsequent anatomical changes often lead to eating difficulties and severe postoperative malnutrition.
review	Thus, screening for cachexia by means of percentage weight loss and BMI during the cancer trajectory and survivorship periods is imperative.
review	Additionally, markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), dysphagia and appetite loss should be assessed at diagnosis.
review	Routine assessments of body composition are also necessary in patients with oesophageal cancer to enable assessment of skeletal muscle loss, which might be masked by sarcopenic obesity in these patients.
review	A need exists for clinical trials examining the effectiveness of therapeutic and physical-activity-based interventions in mitigating muscle loss and counteracting cachexia in these patients.
review	Cachexia in patients with oesophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of psychological distress in gastric cancer patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: The study population included 229 gastric cancer patients visiting Yonsei Cancer Center between November 2009 and March 2011.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The distress was measured by available tools including the Modified Distress Thermometer (MDT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with psychological distress were defined as those who scored above the cut-off values in both the MDT and either one of the HADS or CES-D. Results: The median age of patients was 56 (range, 20 to 86) and 97 (42.
Non-randomized controlled trial	4%) patients were with stage IV disease status at enrollment. The overall prevalence of psychological distress was 33. 6% (95% CI: 27. 5-39. 8%) in 229 gastric cancer patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In multiple logistic regression analysis, lower education level (odds ratio [OR] 2. 39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1. 11-5. 17, P = 0. 026) and higher disease stage (OR 2. 72; 95% CI 1. 47-5. 03, P = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	001) were associated with psychological distress. In stage I-III disease, patients with psychological distress had worse disease-free survival (DFS) (5-year DFS rate: 60% vs 76%, P = 0. 49) compared with those without psychological distress.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In stage IV disease (n = 97), patients with psychological distress showed poorer overall survival than those without psychological distress (median OS (Overall Survival): 12. 2 vs. 13. 8 months, P = 0. 019).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Psychological distress is common in patients with all stages of gastric cancer and is associated with worse outcomes.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Prevalence and prognostic implications of psychological distress in patients with gastric cancer
review	Patients with advanced cancer are at high risk of losing vital body resources resulting in malnutrition, immunodeficiency, impaired quality of life and worse clinical outcome.
review	Prominent among the diverse factors contributing to this complex condition are metabolic derangements characterized by systemic inflammation, catabolism and accumulating changes in body composition.
review	Because cure in advanced cancer still remains elusive, optimal supportive and integrated palliative care are required to allow patients to tolerate aggressive or long-term anticancer treatments, to maintain an adequate quality of life or to stay the course of advancing disease.
review	Support needs to address and focus on all physical, psychological and social problems interfering with food intake, digestion and anabolism to maintaining adequate body resources and functions.
review	Reliable screening for malnutrition, adequate assessment of the nutritional and metabolic status, and individualized multimodal care require the establishment of dedicated operating procedures involving experts and standardized pathways for communication among all participants involved in clinical cancer care.
review	Therapeutic options include counseling, enriching foods, oral nutritional supplements, enteral and parenteral nutrition, metabolic modulation, exercise training, supportive care to enable and improve the intake of adequate amounts of food, as well as psycho-oncology and social support.
review	Finally, to enable this new level of nutritional and metabolic patient care it appears necessary to establish common definitions and grading systems allowing not only for efficient treatment but allocating adequate medical resources to reach this goal.
review	Struggling with nutrition in patients with advanced cancer: nutrition and nourishment-focusing on metabolism and supportive care
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Effective interventions to improve prognosis in metastatic esophagogastric cancer (EGC) are urgently needed.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed the effect of the early integration of interdisciplinary supportive care for patients with metastatic EGC on overall survival (OS).
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: An open-label, phase III, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Patients with previously untreated metastatic EGC were enrolled.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either early interdisciplinary supportive care (ESC) integrated into standard oncologic care or standard care (SC).
randomized controlled trial	ESC was provided by a team of GI medical oncologists, oncology nurse specialists, dietitians, and psychologists; patients in the SC group received standard oncologic care alone. The primary end point was OS in the intention-to-treat population.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Between April 16, 2015, and December 29, 2017, 328 patients were enrolled: 214 in the ESC group and 114 in the SC group. At the data cutoff date of January 26, 2019, 15 (5%) patients were lost to follow-up.
randomized controlled trial	The median number of cycles of first-line chemotherapy was five (interquartile range [IQR], 4-7) in the ESC group and four (IQR, 2-6) in the SC group. The median OS was 14. 8 months (95% CI, 13. 3 to 16. 3) in the ESC group and 11.
randomized controlled trial	9 months (95% CI, 9. 6 to 13. 6) in the SC group (hazard ratio, 0. 68; 95% CI, 0. 51 to 0. 9; P =. 021).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The early integration of interdisciplinary supportive care is an effective intervention with survival benefits for patients with metastatic EGC. Further optimization and standardization are warranted.
randomized controlled trial	Early Interdisciplinary Supportive Care in Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer: A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: First-line chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has a median overall survival (OS) of less than 1 year.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to evaluate first-line programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor-based therapies in gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. We report the first results for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (CheckMate 649), we enrolled adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated, unresectable, non-HER2-positive gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 29 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1 while all three groups were open) via interactive web response technology (block sizes of six) to nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks or 240 mg every 2 weeks) plus chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks or leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin every 2 weeks), nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or chemotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Primary endpoints for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were OS or progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review, in patients whose tumours had a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of five or more.
randomized controlled trial	Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT02872116.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: From March 27, 2017, to April 24, 2019, of 2687 patients assessed for eligibility, we concurrently randomly assigned 1581 patients to treatment (nivolumab plus chemotherapy [n=789, 50%] or chemotherapy alone [n=792, 50%]).
randomized controlled trial	The median follow-up for OS was 13·1 months (IQR 6·7-19·1) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 11·1 months (5·8-16·1) for chemotherapy alone.
randomized controlled trial	Nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [98·4% CI 0·59-0·86]; p<0·0001) and PFS (HR 0·68 [98 % CI 0·56-0·81]; p<0·0001) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of five or more (minimum follow-up 12·1 months).
randomized controlled trial	Additional results showed significant improvement in OS, along with PFS benefit, in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of one or more and all randomly assigned patients.
randomized controlled trial	Among all treated patients, 462 (59%) of 782 patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 341 (44%) of 767 patients in the chemotherapy alone group had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events.
randomized controlled trial	The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (≥25%) were nausea, diarrhoea, and peripheral neuropathy across both groups.
randomized controlled trial	16 (2%) deaths in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and four (1%) deaths in the chemotherapy alone group were considered to be treatment-related. No new safety signals were identified.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Nivolumab is the first PD-1 inhibitor to show superior OS, along with PFS benefit and an acceptable safety profile, in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

randomized controlled trial	First-line nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (CheckMate 649): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Objectives: We compared continuous versus stop-and-go chemotherapy after disease stabilisation with induction chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer (MGC).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: MGC patients who achieved disease control after 6 cycles of S-1/oxaliplatin (SOX) were randomised to receive either continuous SOX until progression (continuous arm) or to have a chemotherapy-free interval followed by SOX reintroduction at progression (stop-and-go arm).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). Results: Of the 250 patients enrolled, 247 participated in the induction phase. Of these, 121 patients were randomised to the continuous arm (n = 59) or the stop-and-go arm (n = 62).
randomized controlled trial	Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the continuous arm than in the stop-and-go arm (10. 5 versus 7. 2 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0. 55, 95% CI, 0. 37-0. 81; P = 0. 002).
randomized controlled trial	Duration of disease control (DDC) and OS, however, were comparable between the two arms: median DDC, 10. 5 versus 11. 3 months, HR 0. 92 (95% CI, 0. 62-1. 36; P = 0. 674); median OS, 22. 6 versus 22. 7 months, HR 0. 78 (95% CI, 0. 50-1. 23; P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	284). Adverse events including grade ≥3 fatigue (28. 8% versus 8. 1%; P = 0. 003) and sensory neuropathy (25. 4% versus 9. 7%; P = 0. 022) occurred more frequently in the continuous arm than in the stop-and-go arm.
randomized controlled trial	Quality of life (QOL) including global health status, physical/role functioning and other symptom scores significantly favoured the stop-and-go arm.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Compared with the stop-and-go strategy, maintenance chemotherapy improved PFS but not DDC and OS and had a negative impact on QOL, suggesting the stop-and-go strategy may be an appropriate option in MGC patients following induction chemotherapy.

randomized controlled trial	Context.
randomized controlled trial	—: Regulatory approval of pembrolizumab for treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma required a reproducible scoring method for use of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein expression as a companion diagnostic to identify likely responders to therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Objective. —: To develop an immunohistochemical scoring algorithm that includes PD-L1 expression for tumor and immune cells, that is, the combined positive score. Design.
randomized controlled trial	—: Four previously treated tumor types in the KEYNOTE-012 and KEYNOTE-028 studies were analyzed descriptively with a version of the PD-L1 immunohistochemical 22C3 pharmDx assay labeled for investigational use only to determine the relative importance of PD-L1 expression in tumor versus immune cells as a biomarker for pembrolizumab response.
randomized controlled trial	A combined positive score was developed as a novel scoring method and was compared with the tumor proportion score in cohort 1 from the KEYNOTE-059 study (G/GEJ cancer). External reproducibility was assessed. Results.
randomized controlled trial	—: Per combined positive score cutoff of 1 or more, the prevalence of PD-L1 expression in patients with G/GEJ cancer was 57. 6% (148 of 257 patients), with reasonable enrichment of responses (odds ratio, 2. 8).
randomized controlled trial	Per tumor proportion score cutoff of 1% or more, prevalence was 12. 5% (32 of 257 patients), with minimal enrichment (odds ratio, 1. 4). External reproducibility assessments demonstrated interpathologist overall agreement of 96.
randomized controlled trial	6% (591 of 612; 95% CI, 94. 0%-98. 7%) and intrapathologist overall agreement of 97. 2% (595 of 612; 95% CI, 95. 3%-98. 9%). Conclusions.
randomized controlled trial	—: Combined positive score is a robust, reproducible PD-L1 scoring method that predicts response to pembrolizumab in patients with G/GEJ cancer.
randomized controlled trial	This novel scoring method supported US Food and Drug Administration approval of pembrolizumab as third-line therapy for G/GEJ cancer and has facilitated investigation in other indications.
randomized controlled trial	Clinical Utility of the Combined Positive Score for Programmed Death Ligand-1 Expression and the Approval of Pembrolizumab for Treatment of Gastric Cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Nivolumab was associated with higher rates of objective response than chemotherapy in a phase 3 study involving patients with ipilimumab-refractory metastatic melanoma.
randomized controlled trial	The use of nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma has not been tested in a phase 3 controlled study.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We randomly assigned 418 previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a BRAF mutation to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks and dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks) or dacarbazine (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks and nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was overall survival. Results: At 1 year, the overall rate of survival was 72. 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65. 5 to 78. 9) in the nivolumab group, as compared with 42. 1% (95% CI, 33. 0 to 50.
randomized controlled trial	9) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0. 42; 99. 79% CI, 0. 25 to 0. 73; P<0. 001). The median progression-free survival was 5. 1 months in the nivolumab group versus 2.
randomized controlled trial	2 months in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0. 43; 95% CI, 0. 34 to 0. 56; P<0. 001). The objective response rate was 40. 0% (95% CI, 33. 3 to 47. 0) in the nivolumab group versus 13. 9% (95% CI, 9. 5 to 19.
randomized controlled trial	4) in the dacarbazine group (odds ratio, 4. 06; P<0. 001). The survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was observed across prespecified subgroups, including subgroups defined by status regarding the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).
randomized controlled trial	Common adverse events associated with nivolumab included fatigue, pruritus, and nausea. Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 11. 7% of the patients treated with nivolumab and 17. 6% of those treated with dacarbazine.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Nivolumab was associated with significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a BRAF mutation.
randomized controlled trial	(Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb; CheckMate 066 ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT01721772. ).
randomized controlled trial	Nivolumab in previously untreated melanoma without BRAF mutation
randomized controlled trial	Background: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.
randomized controlled trial	Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.
randomized controlled trial	We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab. We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.
randomized controlled trial	Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival. Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.
randomized controlled trial	The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01721746.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.
randomized controlled trial	Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31·7%, 95% CI 23·5-40·8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10·6%, 3·5-23·1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).
randomized controlled trial	We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.
randomized controlled trial	Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need. Funding: Bristol-Myers Squibb.
randomized controlled trial	Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Nivolumab (a programmed death 1 [PD-1] checkpoint inhibitor) and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4] checkpoint inhibitor) have been shown to have complementary activity in metastatic melanoma.
randomized controlled trial	In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab was compared with ipilimumab alone in patients with metastatic melanoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 945 previously untreated patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma to nivolumab alone, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or ipilimumab alone.
randomized controlled trial	Progression-free survival and overall survival were coprimary end points. Results regarding progression-free survival are presented here. Results: The median progression-free survival was 11. 5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8. 9 to 16.
randomized controlled trial	7) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with 2. 9 months (95% CI, 2. 8 to 3. 4) with ipilimumab (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0. 42; 99. 5% CI, 0. 31 to 0. 57; P<0. 001), and 6. 9 months (95% CI, 4. 3 to 9.
randomized controlled trial	5) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for the comparison with ipilimumab, 0. 57; 99. 5% CI, 0. 43 to 0. 76; P<0. 001). In patients with tumors positive for the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), the median progression-free survival was 14.
randomized controlled trial	0 months in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, but in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, progression-free survival was longer with the combination therapy than with nivolumab alone (11. 2 months [95% CI, 8.
randomized controlled trial	0 to not reached] vs. 5. 3 months [95% CI, 2. 8 to 7. 1]). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 16. 3% of the patients in the nivolumab group, 55. 0% of those in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 27.
randomized controlled trial	3% of those in the ipilimumab group. Conclusions: Among previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma, nivolumab alone or combined with ipilimumab resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than ipilimumab alone.
randomized controlled trial	In patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade was more effective than either agent alone. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb; CheckMate 067 ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT01844505. ).
randomized controlled trial	Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab or Monotherapy in Untreated Melanoma
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Nivolumab, a human immunoglobulin G4-blocking antibody against the T-cell programmed death-1 checkpoint protein, has activity against metastatic melanoma.
randomized controlled trial	Its safety, clinical efficacy, and correlative biomarkers were assessed with or without a peptide vaccine in ipilimumab-refractory and -naive melanoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In this phase I study, 90 patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma who were ipilimumab naive and had experienced progression after at least one prior therapy (cohorts 1 to 3, 34 patients) or experienced progression after prior ipilimumab (cohorts 4 to 6, 56 patients) received nivolumab at 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years, with or without a multipeptide vaccine.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Nivolumab with vaccine was well tolerated and safe at all doses. The RECIST 1. 1 response rate for both ipilimumab-refractory and -naive patients was 25%. Median duration of response was not reached at a median of 8. 1 months of follow-up.
randomized controlled trial	High pretreatment NY-ESO-1 and MART-1-specific CD8(+) T cells were associated with progression of disease. At week 12, increased peripheral-blood T regulatory cells and decreased antigen-specific T cells were associated with progression.
randomized controlled trial	PD-L1 tumor staining was associated with responses to nivolumab, but negative staining did not rule out a response. Patients who experienced progression after nivolumab could respond to ipilimumab.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: In patients with ipilimumab-refractory or -naive melanoma, nivolumab at 3 mg/kg with or without peptide vaccine was well tolerated and induced responses lasting up to 140 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Responses to nivolumab in ipilimumab-refractory patients or to ipilimumab in nivolumab-refractory patients support combination or sequencing of nivolumab and ipilimumab.

meta analysis	Recent clinical trials have shown the promising therapeutic effects of pembrolizumab and nivolumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Currently, the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) 22C3 pharmDx assay is the only companion diagnostic assay for assessing the safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab.
meta analysis	The purpose of this study was to compare 22C3 pharmDx and 28-8 pharmDx, a complementary diagnostic assay for nivolumab, in gastric cancer.
meta analysis	In this study, 22C3 and 28-8 pharmDx assays were performed on the same formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of gastric adenocarcinoma clinical samples (n = 55).
meta analysis	The concordance rate was evaluated using combined positive score (CPS) cutoffs of 1, 10, and 50. PD-L1 positivity with CPS ≥ 1 was 45. 5% using the 22C3 pharmDx assay and 49. 1% using the 28-8 pharmDx assay.
meta analysis	At a CPS cutoff of 1, the overall percentage agreement was 96. 4%. The positive and negative percentage agreements were 93. 3% and 100%, respectively.
meta analysis	All cases positive for PD-L1 using the 22C3 pharmDx assay were also positive using the 28-8 pharmDx assay. At a CPS cutoff of 10, the overall percentage agreement was 96. 4%. At a CPS cutoff of 50, the two assays exhibited 100% concordance.
meta analysis	Nonspecific cytoplasmic staining in the background tissues and tumor cells was often observed in the 28-8 pharmDx assay.
meta analysis	When the results of the two assays were matched for response to immunotherapy, the overall response rate was higher in patients with a PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 than in PD-L1-negative patients (22C3 pharmDx, P = 0. 001; 28-8 pharmDx, P = 0. 002).
meta analysis	In conclusion, PD-L1 22C3 and 28-8 pharmDx assays were highly comparable at CPS cutoffs of 1, 10, and 50 in gastric cancer. These results provide evidence for the potential interchangeability of the two PD-L1 assays in gastric cancer.
meta analysis	PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer: interchangeability of 22C3 and 28-8 pharmDx assays for responses to immunotherapy
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Intrapatient heterogeneity of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) could influence their roles as predictive biomarkers for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).
Non-randomized controlled trial	In this retrospective analysis, we evaluated the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and prognostic relevance of PD-L1 expression and TMB in GEA.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Experimental design: A cohort of 211 patients with stage II-IV GEA was retrospectively reviewed for a total of 407 tumor samples with PD-L1 expression data and 319 tumor samples with TMB data.
Non-randomized controlled trial	PD-L1 status was defined as positive if combined positive score (CPS) ≥1 using the 22C3 pharmDx assay.
Non-randomized controlled trial	TMB levels were categorized as low, intermediate, or high (≤5, 5-15, or >15 mutations/Mb), or using a single threshold (<10 or ≥10 mutation/Mb), determined by next-generation sequencing using a targeted gene panel.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 407 tumors, 56% were PD-L1 negative and 44% PD-L1 positive. Of 319 tumors, 50% were TMB-low, 45% TMB-intermediate, and 5% TMB-high; 86% had <10 and 14% ≥10 mutations/Mb. TMB level was significantly associated with MSI-status.
Non-randomized controlled trial	PD-L1 expression and TMB exhibited marked spatial heterogeneity between baseline primary and metastatic tumors (61% and 69% concordance), and temporal heterogeneity between tumors before and after chemotherapy (57%-63% and 73%-75% concordance).
Non-randomized controlled trial	PD-L1 expression and TMB were not significantly associated with overall survival. Conclusions: PD-L1 expression and TMB exhibit marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity in GEA.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This heterogeneity should be considered when obtaining tumor samples for molecular testing and when deciding whether ICI therapy is appropriate. See related commentary by Klempner et al. , p. 6401.

randomized controlled trial	Importance: Safe and effective therapies for untreated, advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer remain an unmet need.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone in patients with untreated, advanced G/GEJ cancer with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or greater.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: The phase 3 KEYNOTE-062 randomized, controlled, partially blinded interventional trial enrolled 763 patients with untreated, locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic G/GEJ cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or greater from 200 centers in 29 countries between September 18, 2015, and May 26, 2017.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m2/d on day 1 plus fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5 or capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily), or chemotherapy plus placebo, every 3 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or greater or 10 or greater.
randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 763 patients were randomized to pembrolizumab (n = 256), pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n = 257), or chemotherapy (n = 250). The median (range) age of all patients in the study cohort was 62 (20-87) years; 554 of 763 (72.
randomized controlled trial	6%) were men. At final analysis, after a median (range) follow-up of 29. 4 (22. 0-41. 3) months, pembrolizumab was noninferior to chemotherapy for OS in patients with CPS of 1 or greater (median, 10. 6 vs 11. 1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 91; 99.
randomized controlled trial	2% CI, 0. 69-1. 18). Pembrolizumab monotherapy was not superior to chemotherapy in patients with CPS of 1 or greater. Pembrolizumab prolonged OS vs chemotherapy in patients with CPS of 10 or greater (median, 17. 4 vs 10. 8 months; HR, 0.
randomized controlled trial	69; 95% CI, 0. 49-0. 97), but this difference was not statistically tested. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was not superior to chemotherapy for OS in patients with CPS of 1 or greater (12. 5 vs 11. 1 months; HR, 0. 85; 95% CI, 0. 70-1. 03; P =.
randomized controlled trial	05) or CPS of 10 or greater (12. 3 vs 10. 8 months; HR, 0. 85; 95% CI, 0. 62-1. 17; P =. 16) or for PFS in patients with CPS of 1 or greater (6. 9 vs 6. 4 months; HR, 0. 84; 95% CI, 0. 70-1. 02; P =. 04).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse event rates for pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and chemotherapy were 17%, 73%, and 69%, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions and relevance: This phase 3 randomized clinical trial found that among patients with untreated, advanced G/GEJ cancer, pembrolizumab was noninferior to chemotherapy, with fewer adverse events observed.
randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was not superior to chemotherapy for the OS and PFS end points tested. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02494583.
randomized controlled trial	Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab or Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy Alone for Patients With First-line, Advanced Gastric Cancer: The KEYNOTE-062 Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: First-line therapy for advanced oesophageal cancer is currently limited to fluoropyrimidine plus platinum-based chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to evaluate the antitumour activity of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced oesophageal cancer and Siewert type 1 gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study across 168 medical centres in 26 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer or Siewert type 1 gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (regardless of PD-L1 status), measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.
randomized controlled trial	1, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, plus 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (chemotherapy), once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, histology, and performance status. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to group assignment and PD-L1 biomarker status.
randomized controlled trial	Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more, and overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and in all randomised patients.
randomized controlled trial	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT03189719, and is closed to recruitment.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between July 25, 2017, and June 3, 2019, 1020 patients were screened and 749 were enrolled and randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=373 [50%]) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=376 [50%]).
randomized controlled trial	At the first interim analysis (median follow-up of 22·6 months), pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was superior to placebo plus chemotherapy for overall survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (median 13·9 months vs 8·8 months; hazard ratio 0·57 [95% CI 0·43-0·75]; p<0·0001), oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (12·6 months vs 9·8 months; 0·72 [0·60-0·88]; p=0·0006), PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (13·5 months vs 9·4 months; 0·62 [0·49-0·78]; p<0·0001), and in all randomised patients (12·4 months vs 9·8 months; 0·73 [0·62-0·86]; p<0·0001).
randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was superior to placebo plus chemotherapy for progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (6·3 months vs 5·8 months; 0·65 [0·54-0·78]; p<0·0001), PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (7·5 months vs 5·5 months; 0·51 [0·41-0·65]; p<0·0001), and in all randomised patients (6·3 months vs 5·8 months; 0·65 [0·55-0·76]; p<0·0001).
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 266 (72%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 250 (68%) in the placebo plus chemotherapy group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy improved overall survival in patients with previously untreated, advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and in all randomised patients regardless of histology, and had a manageable safety profile in the total as-treated population.

randomized controlled trial	Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for first-line treatment of advanced oesophageal cancer (KEYNOTE-590): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The US Food and Drug Administration has granted regulatory approval for the use of nivolumab-an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma (GEAC), regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
randomized controlled trial	However, the efficacy of ICIs in low PD-L1-expressing tumors remains unclear.
randomized controlled trial	Materials and methods: This study aims to reconstruct unreported Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots of PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) subgroups of randomized phase III trials comparing the addition of ICIs with conventional chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of GEAC.
randomized controlled trial	A graphical reconstructive algorithm was adopted to estimate time-to-event outcomes from reported overall survival and progression-free survival (OS and PFS) KM plots describing overall or subgroup cohorts.
randomized controlled trial	Using reconstructed time-to-event outcomes, KMSubtraction conducts bipartite matching of patients from the reported subgroup among the overall cohort.
randomized controlled trial	By excluding matched patients, KM plots and survival analyses of the unreported subgroups were retrieved. Results: CheckMate-649, KEYNOTE-062, and KEYNOTE-590 were included.
randomized controlled trial	Two PD-L1 subgroups were identified with data unreported in the primary manuscripts: PD-L1 CPS 1-4 from CheckMate-649 and PD-L1 CPS 1-9 from KEYNOTE-062.
randomized controlled trial	No significant differences in OS and PFS were demonstrated in ICI-chemotherapy combinations when compared with chemotherapy among CheckMate-649 PD-L1 CPS 1-4 (OS: hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 950, 95% CI, 0. 747 to 1. 209, P =. 678; PFS: HR = 0.
randomized controlled trial	958, 95% CI, 0. 743 to 1. 236, P =. 743) and KEYNOTE-062 PD-L1 CPS 1-9 subgroups. In the KEYNOTE-062 PD-L1 CPS 1-9 subgroup, patients treated with pembrolizumab had an increased hazard of tumor progression (HR = 2. 092, 95% CI, 1. 661 to 2. 635, P <.
randomized controlled trial	001). Conclusion: Using KMSubtraction, data of PD-L1 subgroups previously unreported by primary manuscripts of pivotal clinical trials were retrieved.
randomized controlled trial	These data suggest the lack of benefit in the addition of ICI to chemotherapy in low PD-L1-expressing GEAC tumors.
randomized controlled trial	Low Programmed Death-Ligand 1-Expressing Subgroup Outcomes of First-Line Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Gastric or Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: The tumor proportion score (TPS) and combined positive score (CPS) have been developed to assess programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in gastric cancer (GC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	This study aimed to elucidate the role of TPS and CPS as prognostic biomarkers. Methods: A total of 191 patients with GC who received curative gastrectomy were retrospectively enrolled.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Double immunohistochemistry of PD-L1 and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 was performed to clearly distinguish PD-L1 expression between tumor cells and macrophages. Survival analysis for PD-L1 expression by TPS and CPS was performed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: PD-L1 positivity was detected in 39 patients (20. 4%) by TPS and in 137 patients (71. 7%) by CPS. Patients with PD-L1 positivity by CPS experienced significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P < 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	01) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0. 01) than the other patients. In contrast, patients with either PD-L1 status by the TPS showed similar OS and RFS times.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Multivariate Cox regression analysis for OS and RFS demonstrated that PD-L1 positivity by CPS was a significant independent factor for poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1. 27-4. 37, P < 0. 01) and RFS (HR 1. 81, 95% CI 1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	07-3. 22, P = 0. 03). Conclusions: CPS was shown to be a more useful assessment method of determining PD-L1 expression than TPS as a prognostic biomarker.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This suggests that the total number of PD-L1-expressing cells, including tumor and immune cells, is a more sensitive prognostic biomarker than the number of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells in GC.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Prognostic impacts of the combined positive score and the tumor proportion score for programmed death ligand-1 expression by double immunohistochemical staining in patients with advanced gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Importance: Standard first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma is chemotherapy, but the prognosis remains poor.
randomized controlled trial	Camrelizumab (an anti-programmed death receptor 1 [PD-1] antibody) showed antitumor activity in previously treated advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial (ESCORT-1st study) enrolled patients from 60 hospitals in China between December 3, 2018, and May 12, 2020 (final follow-up, October 30, 2020).
randomized controlled trial	A total of 751 patients were screened and 596 eligible patients with untreated advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were randomized.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg (n = 298) or placebo (n = 298), combined with up to 6 cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2). All treatments were given intravenously every 3 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: Coprimary end points were overall survival (significance threshold, 1-sided P <. 02) and progression-free survival (significance threshold, 1-sided P <. 005).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 596 patients randomized (median age, 62 years [interquartile range, 56-67 years]; 523 men [87. 8%]), 1 patient in the placebo-chemotherapy group did not receive planned treatment. A total of 490 patients (82.
randomized controlled trial	2%) had discontinued the study treatment. The median follow-up was 10. 8 months. The overall survival for the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group was a median of 15. 3 months (95% CI, 12. 8-17. 3; 135 deaths) vs a median of 12. 0 months (95% CI, 11. 0-13.
randomized controlled trial	3; 174 deaths) for the placebo-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0. 70 [95% CI, 0. 56-0. 88]; 1-sided P =. 001). Progression-free survival for camrelizumab plus chemotherapy was a median of 6. 9 months (95% CI, 5. 8-7.
randomized controlled trial	4; 199 progression or deaths) vs 5. 6 months (95% CI, 5. 5-5. 7; 229 progression or deaths) for the placebo-chemotherapy group (HR for progression or death, 0. 56 [95% CI, 0. 46-0. 68]; 1-sided P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 189 patients (63. 4%) in the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group and 201 (67. 7%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including treatment-related deaths among 9 patients (3.
randomized controlled trial	0%) and 11 patients (3. 7%), respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the addition of camrelizumab to chemotherapy, compared with placebo and chemotherapy, significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival.

randomized controlled trial	Effect of Camrelizumab vs Placebo Added to Chemotherapy on Survival and Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The ESCORT-1st Randomized Clinical Trial
randomized controlled trial	Importance: Immunotherapy has been associated with improved outcomes among patients who have received previous treatment for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab therapy vs chemotherapy among patients with MSI-H advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer regardless of the line of therapy in which it was received.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: This post hoc analysis of the phase 2 KEYNOTE-059 (third-line treatment or higher) single-arm trial and the phase 3 KEYNOTE-061 (second-line treatment) and KEYNOTE-062 (first-line treatment) randomized trials included patients with advanced G/GEJ cancer from 52 sites in 16 countries enrolled in KEYNOTE-059, 148 sites in 30 countries enrolled in KEYNOTE-061, and 200 sites in 29 countries enrolled in KEYNOTE-062.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were enrolled from March 2, 2015, to March 26, 2016, in KEYNOTE-059; from June 4, 2015, to July 26, 2016, in KEYNOTE-061; and from September 18, 2015, to May 26, 2017, in KEYNOTE-062, with data cutoff dates of August 8, 2018; October 26, 2017; and March 26, 2019; respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Interventions: Pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-059, pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy (paclitaxel) in KEYNOTE-061, and pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine), or chemotherapy alone in KEYNOTE-062.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: Response was assessed centrally using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1. 1; MSI-H status was determined centrally by polymerase chain reaction testing.
randomized controlled trial	Results: At data cutoff, 7 of 174 patients (4. 0%) in KEYNOTE-059, 27 of 514 patients (5. 3%) in KEYNOTE-061, and 50 of 682 patients (7. 3%) in KEYNOTE-062 had MSI-H tumors.
randomized controlled trial	Among those with MSI-H tumors, the median overall survival was not reached (NR) for pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-061, and KEYNOTE-062 or for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-062.
randomized controlled trial	The median progression-free survival (PFS) for pembrolizumab was NR (95% CI, 1. 1 months to NR) in KEYNOTE-059 and 17. 8 months (95% CI, 2. 7 months to NR) in KEYNOTE-061 (vs 3. 5 months [95% CI, 2. 0-9. 8 months] for chemotherapy).
randomized controlled trial	In KEYNOTE-062, the median PFS was 11. 2 months (95% CI, 1. 5 months to NR) for pembrolizumab, NR (95% CI, 3. 6 months to NR) for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and 6. 6 months (95% CI, 4. 4-8. 3 months) for chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	The objective response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab was 57. 1% in KEYNOTE-059 and 46. 7% (vs 16. 7% for chemotherapy) in KEYNOTE-061. In KEYNOTE-062, the ORR was 57. 1% for pembrolizumab , 64. 7% for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and 36.
randomized controlled trial	8% for chemotherapy. Conclusions and relevance: Findings from this study indicate that MSI-H status may be a biomarker for pembrolizumab therapy among patients with advanced G/GEJ cancer regardless of the line of therapy in which it was received.

randomized controlled trial	Assessment of Pembrolizumab Therapy for the Treatment of Microsatellite Instability-High Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer Among Patients in the KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-061, and KEYNOTE-062 Clinical Trials
Non-randomized controlled trial	It has been reported that HER2 expression is different in gastric and breast cancers, and a gastric cancer scoring system (GCSS) has recently been suggested.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We investigated HER2 protein expression using GCSS and a breast cancer scoring system (BCSS) and correlated it with HER2 gene amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 status was evaluated in 1091 cases by analyzing tissue microarrays constructed using 2 different cores from each case.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Polyclonal (HercepTest) and monoclonal (Pathway) antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC), and results were scored by BCSS and GCSS.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Gene amplification was evaluated by automated dual-color silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) in all cases and correlated with the results from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 590 cases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The concordance between the IHC results using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies was high (κ = 0. 785). The results of dual-color SISH and FISH showed very high concordance as well (κ = 0. 918).
Non-randomized controlled trial	GCSS was significantly more sensitive for detecting SISH positivity than was BCSS in both antibodies (polyclonal, P =. 003; monoclonal, P <. 001), but specificity was higher in BCSS than GCSS (polyclonal, P =. 004; monoclonal, P <. 001).
Non-randomized controlled trial	It has been recently shown that HER2-overexpressing patients with unresectable gastric cancer benefited from trastuzumab therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Because IHC is recommended before gene amplification studies in HER2 testing, GCSS should be used for evaluating HER2 expression in gastric cancers.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Comprehensive analysis of HER2 expression and gene amplification in gastric cancers using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization: which scoring system should we use?
Non-randomized controlled trial	The clinical significance of ERBB2 amplification/overexpression in gastric cancer remains unclear.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In this study, we evaluated the ERBB2 status in 463 gastric carcinomas using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), and compared the findings with histopathological characteristics and with disease-specific survival.
Non-randomized controlled trial	ERBB2 overexpression (2+ and 3+) and amplification (ratio ERBB2/CEP17 >or= 2) were found in 43 (9. 3%) and 38 (8. 2%) gastric carcinomas, respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Perfect IHC/FISH correlation was found for the 19 cases scored as 0 (all negative by FISH), and also for the 25 cases scored as 3+ (all positive by FISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	One out of six carcinomas scored as 1+ and 12 out of 18 carcinomas scored as 2+ were positive by FISH. ERBB2 amplification was associated with gastric carcinomas of intestinal type (P=0. 007) and with an expansive growth pattern (P=0. 021).
Non-randomized controlled trial	ERBB2 amplification was detected in both histological components of two mixed carcinomas, indicating a common clonal origin.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A statistically significant association was found between ERBB2 amplification and worse survival in patients with expansive gastric carcinomas (P=0. 011).
Non-randomized controlled trial	We conclude that ERBB2 status may have clinical significance in subsets of gastric cancer patients, and that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether patients whose gastric carcinomas present ERBB2 amplification/overexpression may benefit from therapy targeting this surface receptor.

Non-randomized controlled trial	c-erb-2 amplification and overexpression are currently attracting a great deal of attention because a new adjuvant therapy using an antibody against the c-erbB-2 gene product, trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, Inc.
Non-randomized controlled trial	, South San Francisco, CA), has proved effective in treating breast cancer with amplification and/or overexpression of c-erbB-2. Aberrations of c-erbB-2 have also been detected in ovarian, endometrial and gastric carcinomas at varied frequencies.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Amplification of the c-erbB-2 locus (17q12-q21.
Non-randomized controlled trial	32), overexpression of c-erbB-2 protein (p185) and serum levels of soluble c-erbB-2 protein fragments (p105) were examined in gastric cancer patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Overexpression of c-erbB-2 protein was found in 29 (8. 2%) of the 352 gastric carcinomas analyzed. In FISH analysis, all tumors with 3+ immunostaining and 1 of 5 tumors with 2+ staining showed high-level amplification of c-erbB-2.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Pre-operative serum p105 was quantified in serum specimens from 129 patients with gastric cancer and 28 patients with benign diseases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	There were no significant differences in the serum p105 levels among 11 patients with c-erbB-2-overexpressing carcinomas, 118 patients with c-erbB-2 non-overexpressing carcinomas and 28 controls, although a single case of gastric carcinoma overexpressing c-erbB-2 with extensive liver metastasis had a higher level than the cut-off value.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The mechanisms of overexpression of p185 and high-level amplification of c-erbB-2 in gastric adenocarcinomas seem similar to those well-established in breast cancers.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients having gastric adenocarcinoma with c-erbB-2 amplification are potential candidates for a new adjuvant therapy using humanized monoclonal antibody.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: The EGFR and HER2 genes are located on chromosomes 7 and 17, respectively. They are therapeutic targets in some tumors.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The TOP2A gene, which is located near HER2 on chromosome 17, is the target of many chemotherapeutic agents, and co-amplification of HER2 and TOP2A has been described in several tumor types.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Herein, we investigated the gene status of EGFR, HER2, and TOP2A in Chinese gastric carcinoma patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We determined the rate of polysomy for chromosomes 7 and 17, and we attempted to clarify the relationship between EGFR, HER2, and TOP2A gene copy number and increased expression of their encoded proteins.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Furthermore, we tried to address the relationship between alterations in EGFR, HER2, and TOP2A and chromosome polysomy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: One hundred cases of formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tumor tissues from Chinese gastric carcinoma patients were investigated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Forty-two percent of the cases showed EGFR overexpression; 16% showed EGFR FISH positive; 6% showed HER2 overexpression; and 11% showed HER2 gene amplification, including all six HER2 overexpression cases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	TOP2A nuclear staining (nuclear index, NI) was determined in all 100 tumors: NI values ranged from 0. 5-90%. Three percent of the tumors showed TOP2A gene amplification, which were all accompanied by HER2 gene amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Nineteen percent of the tumors showed chromosome 7 polysomy, and 16% showed chromosome 17 polysomy. Chromosome 7 polysomy correlated significantly with EGFR FISH-positivity, but was not associated with EGFR overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 overexpression associated significantly with HER2 gene amplification. TOP2A gene amplification was significantly associated with HER2 gene amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	No relationship was found between alterations in the EGFR, HER2, and TOP2A genes and clinicopathologic variables of gastric carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The data from our study suggest that chromosome 7 polysomy may be responsible for increased EGFR gene copy number in gastric carcinomas, and that HER2 gene amplification may be the major reason for HER2 protein overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A combined investigation of the gene status of EGFR, HER2, and TOP2A should facilitate the identification of a target therapeutic regimen for gastric carcinoma patients.

randomized controlled trial	Methods: ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation.
randomized controlled trial	Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab.
randomized controlled trial	Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01041404.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.
randomized controlled trial	6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17. 1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13. 8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.
randomized controlled trial	1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0. 74; 95% CI 0. 60-0. 91; p=0. 0046).
randomized controlled trial	The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]).
randomized controlled trial	Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. Funding: F Hoffmann-La Roche.
randomized controlled trial	Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Recent advances in molecular targeted therapy have identified HER2 as an important target for anti-cancer therapy in gastric cancer (GC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although the clinical relevance and prognostic significance of HER2 in breast cancer has been well acknowledged, it remains controversial in GC. Methods: HER2 expression was investigated in two independent series of GC by immunohistochemical staining.
Non-randomized controlled trial	One series corresponded to 1,414 cases of whole-tissue sections and the other corresponded to 595 cases of tissue microarrays (TMAs). Results were compared and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Results: HER2-positivity was detected in 12.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3% of whole-tissue sections and 17% of TMAs. Among samples scored 3+, 90. 1% stained ≥50% of the tumor area, but only 40. 9% in score 2+ cases stained ≥50% of the tumor area. In whole-tissue sections, HER2-positivity was correlated with age (P = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	002), histological type (differentiated or intestinal, P < 0. 001), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0. 005), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0. 009). In TMAs, HER2-positivity was correlated only with age (P = 0. 003) and histological type (P < 0. 001).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Multivariate analyses of the differentiated GC subgroup revealed that HER2-positivity was an independent poor prognostic factor (P = 0. 042). The cases with HER2-positive in ≥50% of the tumor area showed worse prognosis than those of <50% (P = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	021).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Despite discrepancies in the results from whole-tissue sections and TMAs, HER2 overexpression was positively correlated with aggressive biological behavior and was an independent poor prognostic factor for recurrence in differentiated GCs.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Therefore, HER2-positive GCs should be considered for adjuvant trastuzumab therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Evaluation of HER2 protein expression in gastric carcinomas: comparative analysis of 1,414 cases of whole-tissue sections and 595 cases of tissue microarrays
Cohort study	Purpose: Primary tumor classification of gastric or esophageal cancer has changed significantly with recent alterations of the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system.
Cohort study	Considering these alterations, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity rates were determined and compared in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Cohort study	Additionally, HER2 positivity in relation to other clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated.
Cohort study	Methods: A total of 321 patients with histologically confirmed invasive gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma were examined for HER2 by immunohistochemy (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH).
Cohort study	IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/CISH-positive tumors were considered HER2 positive. Clinicopathological characteristics were retrospectively retrieved from the patient records. Results: HER2 positivity was found in 50 of 321 patients (15. 6 %).
Cohort study	In univariate and multivariate logistic models, HER2 positivity rates were significantly higher in esophageal primary tumors (esophageal 25. 0 % vs. gastric 7. 4 %) and in intestinal histological tumor type (intestinal 22. 6 % vs. diffuse/mixed 5.
Cohort study	7 %). No significant differences in HER2 positivity were found between males and females, age below and above 65 years, biopsies and surgical specimens or advanced and early-stage disease. Using the 7th TNM edition, many tumors (30.
Cohort study	5 % of all included tumors and 64. 5 % of all esophageal primary tumors) previously classified as gastric cancer are now classified as esophageal cancer. Conclusions: HER2 positivity occurs in 15.
Cohort study	6 % of invasive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma in Western patients, of which the majority is esophageal primary tumors and of the intestinal tumor type.
Cohort study	With the introduction of the 7th TNM edition, a large number of tumors previously classified as gastric are now classified as esophageal tumors instead, with relatively high HER2 positivity rates in these esophageal primary tumors.
Cohort study	HER2 positivity in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma: clinicopathological analysis and comparison
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: HER-2/neu gene amplification has predictive value in breast cancer patients responding to trastuzumab. We wanted to investigate the frequency and clinical significance of HER-2/neu amplification in gastric carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: The frequency of HER-2/neu and Topoisomerase IIalpha gene amplification was studied in adenocarcinomas of the stomach (n=131) and the gastroesophageal junction (n=100) by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Sensitivity of a gastric cancer cell line N87 with HER-2/neu amplification to trastuzumab was studied by a cell viability assay and compared with that of a HER-2 amplified breast cancer cell line SKBR-3.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Growth inhibition of N87 cells was also verified in vivo in N87 xenograft tumors. Results: HER-2/neu amplification was present in 16 (12. 2%) of the 131 gastric and in 24 (24. 0%) of the 100 gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Co-amplification of Topoisomerase IIalpha was present in the majority of gastric (63%) and esophagogastric junction cancers (68%) with HER-2/neu amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2/neu amplification was more common in the intestinal histologic type of gastric cancer (21. 5%) than in the diffuse (2%) or the mixed/anaplastic type (5%, P=0. 0051), but it was not associated with gender, age at diagnosis or clinical stage.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Presence of HER-2/neu amplification was associated with poor carcinoma-specific survival (P=0. 0089).
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2/neu targeting antibody trastuzumab inhibited the growth of a p185(HER-2/neu) overexpressing gastric and breast carcinoma cell lines (N87 and SKBR-3) with equal efficacy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: HER-2/neu amplification is common in the intestinal type of gastric carcinoma, and it is associated with a poor outcome. HER-2 might be a useful target in this disease, and this hypothesis deserves to be investigated in clinical trials.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Amplification of HER-2 in gastric carcinoma: association with Topoisomerase IIalpha gene amplification, intestinal type, poor prognosis and sensitivity to trastuzumab
review	Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the world and its management, especially in advanced stages, has evolved relatively little.
review	In particular, no targeted modality has so far been incorporated to its treatment armamentarium. HER2 overexpression is increasingly recognized as a frequent molecular abnormality, driven as in breast cancer by gene amplification.
review	There is mounting evidence of the role of HER2 overexpression in patients with gastric cancer, and it has been solidly correlated to poor outcomes and a more aggressive disease.
review	Additionally, preclinical data are showing significant antitumor efficacy of anti-HER2 therapies (particularly monoclonal antibodies directed towards the protein) in in vitro and in vivo models of gastric cancer.
review	As a result, several clinical trials are exploring in different settings and with diverse designs the potential of anti-HER2 therapies in gastric cancer patients.
review	This review summarizes the rationale, preclinical evidence, retrospective clinical analyses, and the interim clinical data pertaining HER2 therapies in gastric cancer.
review	HER2 in gastric cancer: a new prognostic factor and a novel therapeutic target
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: HER2 is the only validated predictive biomarker in gastro-oesophageal carcinoma (GOC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, several factors, such as heterogeneity in protein expression, shortage of evaluable tumour tissue and need for quick target assessment, underline the usefulness of a pre-screening tool in order to anticipate HER2 status.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Data from 723 consecutive GOC analysed for HER2 at four Italian Institutions were collected. HER2 positivity was defined as 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ with gene amplification by in situ hybridisation (ISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	A multivariate logistic regression model was built using data from 413 cases, whereas 310 patients served as validation cohort.
Non-randomized controlled trial	C-index, visual inspection of the calibration plot, Brier score and Spiegelhalter z-test were used to assess the performance of the nomogram. Results: HER2 positive rate was 17. 4%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Four variables were retained after adjustment in the final model: grading, Lauren's histotype, pathologic material analysed (surgical specimen/biopsy) and site of tissue collection (primary tumour/metastases).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Visual inspection of the calibration plot revealed a very good overlap between predicted and observed probabilities, with a Brier score of 0. 101 and a non-significant Spiegelhalter z-test (P = 0. 319). C-index resulted in 0. 827 (95%CI 0. 741-0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	913). Conclusion: A simple nomogram based on always-available pathologic information accurately predicts the probability of HER2 positivity in GOC.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Validated clinico-pathologic nomogram in the prediction of HER2 status in gastro-oesophageal cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: We examined the frequency, tumor characteristics, and prognostic impact of HER2 protein expression and gene amplification in patients with curatively resected esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Experimental design: HER2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgical EAC specimens (n = 713). Gene amplification was examined by FISH in a large subset (n = 344).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Most tumors were T3-4 (66%) or node positive (72%); 95% were located in the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. No patient received neoadjuvant therapy. Cox models were used. Results: Overall, 17% of EACs were HER2 positive (i. e.
Non-randomized controlled trial	, IHC3(+) or IHC2(+) with amplification), with strong agreement between HER2 amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2) and expression (κ = 0. 83).
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 positivity was significantly associated with lower tumor grade, less invasiveness, fewer malignant nodes, and the presence of adjacent Barrett's esophagus (BE).
Non-randomized controlled trial	EACs with BE had higher odds of HER2 positivity than EACs without BE, independent of pathologic features [OR = 1. 8 (95% CI: 1. 1-2. 8), P = 0. 014].
Non-randomized controlled trial	Among all cases, HER2 positivity was significantly associated with disease-specific survival (DSS) in a manner that differed by the presence or absence of BE (P(interaction) = 0. 0047).
Non-randomized controlled trial	In EACs with BE, HER2 positivity was significantly associated with improved DSS [HR = 0. 54 (95% CI: 0. 35-0. 84), P = 0. 0065] and overall survival (P = 0. 0022) independent of pathologic features, but was not prognostic among EACs without BE.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: HER2 positivity was shown in 17% of resected EACs and associated with reduced tumor aggressiveness.
Non-randomized controlled trial	EACs with BE had nearly twice the odds of being HER2 positive and, within this subgroup, HER2 positivity was independently associated with improved survival.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Association of HER2/ErbB2 expression and gene amplification with pathologic features and prognosis in esophageal adenocarcinomas
Non-randomized controlled trial	The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 gene (HER-2) encodes for a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase (Her-2), which is overexpressed in various human cancers.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Her-2-targeted therapy has recently been shown to be beneficial for patients with advanced gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Her-2 protein expression was investigated in 341 esophageal carcinomas [152 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 189 adenocarcinomas (AC)], 39 cases of Barrett mucosa, and 11 cases of squamous cell dysplasia.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by colorimetric in-situ hybridization. Positive Her-2 status was found in 15. 3% of ACs and 3. 9% of SCCs. Positive Her-2-status was more common in dysplastic Barrett mucosas compared with nondysplastic ones (P=0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	04). In 26% of the patients with ACs who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=39), the Her-2 status of pretherapeutic biopsies was different compared with subsequent surgical specimens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	There was no statistically significant correlation between Her-2 status and patients' survival. Although Her-2 overexpression is rare in SCCs, it is found in 15.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3% of ACs, where amplification of HER-2 gene and overexpression of Her-2 protein seem to be early events in carcinogenesis.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The evaluation of Her-2 status in tumor biopsies and in particular in the context with possible alterations after neoadjuvant treatment can potentially lead to false Her-2-staging.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although Her-2-overexpression in esophageal cancer seems to have no influence on patients' survival, these subtypes of esophageal ACs have to be considered as targets for an anti-Her-2 therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Expression of Her-2 in carcinomas of the esophagus
Non-randomized controlled trial	The HER2 oncogene was recently reported to be amplified and overexpressed in esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the relationship of HER2 amplification in esophageal adenocarcinoma with prognosis has not been well defined.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The scoring systems for clinically evaluating HER2 in esophageal adenocarcinoma are not established.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The aims of the study were to establish a HER2 scoring system and comprehensively investigate HER2 amplification and overexpression in esophageal adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesion.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Using a tissue microarray, containing 116 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma, 34 cases of Barrett's esophagus, 18 cases of low-grade dysplasia and 15 cases of high-grade dysplasia, HER2 amplification and overexpression were analyzed by HercepTest and chromogenic in situ hybridization methods.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The amplification frequency in an independent series of 116 esophageal adenocarcinoma samples was also analyzed using Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 microarrays.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In our studies, we have found that HER2 amplification does not associate with poor prognosis in total 232 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients by chromogenic in situ hybridization and high-density microarrays.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We further confirm the similar frequency of HER2 amplification by chromogenic in situ hybridization (18%; 21 out of 116) and SNP 6. 0 microarrays (16%, 19 out of 116) in esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 protein overexpression was observed in 12% (14 out of 116) of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 7% (1 out of 15) of high-grade dysplasia. No HER2 amplification or overexpression was identified in Barrett's esophagus or low-grade dysplasia.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All HER2 protein overexpression cases showed HER2 gene amplification. Gene amplification was found to be more frequent by chromogenic in situ hybridization than protein overexpression in esophageal adenocarcinoma (18 vs 12%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	A modified two-step model for esophageal adenocarcinoma HER2 testing is recommended for clinical esophageal adenocarcinoma HER2 trial.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 amplification, overexpression and score criteria in esophageal adenocarcinoma
Non-randomized controlled trial	Molecular therapies targeting HER2 are part of the established drug armamentarium in breast carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Now the ToGA trial, an international multicenter phase III clinical study, involving 24 countries globally, has shown that the anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab is effective in prolonging survival in HER2-positive carcinoma of the stomach and the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Similarly to breast carcinoma, >20% of gastric cancers show HER2 overexpression and/or amplification, and this percentage increases to 33% in GEJ tumors.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Thus, as in breast carcinoma, pathologists are now asked to evaluate HER2 status in gastric carcinoma samples.
Non-randomized controlled trial	As validated in the ToGA trial, the HER2 testing criteria that must be used in evaluating both gastric carcinoma biopsies and surgical specimens significantly differ from those routinely applied in breast carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The main variations with regard to the pattern of reactivity in HER2-expressing cells are as follows: the completeness of membrane staining is not a "conditio sine qua non" and the number of stained cells necessary to consider a case as positive is different.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We must also take note of the much more frequent heterogeneity of HER2 positivity in gastric cancer compared with breast carcinoma and the less stringent correlation between HER2 amplification and protein overexpression that is observed in gastric carcinoma, where more than 20% of cases may carry HER2 amplification, although of low level, without HER2 expression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In these patients, in the ToGA trial, there was no apparent benefit from adding Trastuzumab to chemotherapy: for this reason the European Medicines Agency, while approving usage of Trastuzumab for metastatic adenocarcinoma treatment, indicated HER2 testing by immunohistochemistry as first evaluation assay, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 2+ equivocal cases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 testing in gastric carcinoma is a new field, opening several opportunities: for patients with gastric cancer, this is a new promising therapeutic option; for pathologists, strengthening our role in therapy selection and emphasizing our duty of providing accurate and reproducible HER2 testing results; for all interested in understanding the biology of gastric and GEJ cancer and in discovering new possible molecular therapy targets.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 testing in gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: In the Trastuzumab for GAstric cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival by 2.
randomized controlled trial	7 months in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive] gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.
randomized controlled trial	74). Post hoc exploratory analyses in patients expressing higher HER2 levels (IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive or IHC 3+) demonstrated a 4. 2-month improvement in median overall survival with trastuzumab (hazard ratio 0. 65).
randomized controlled trial	The ToGA study provides the largest screening dataset available on HER2 overexpression/amplification in this indication. We further analyzed correlation(s) of HER2 overexpression/amplification with clinical and epidemiological factors.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: HER2-positivity was analyzed by histological subtype, tumor location, geographic region, and specimen type. Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed. Results: The HER2-positivity rate was 22. 1 % across analyzed tumor samples.
randomized controlled trial	Rates were similar between European and Asian patients (23. 6 % vs. 23. 9 %), but higher in intestinal- vs. diffuse-type (31. 8 % vs. 6. 1 %), and gastroesophageal junction cancer versus gastric tumors (32. 2 % vs. 21. 4 %).
randomized controlled trial	Across all IHC scores, variability in HER2 staining (≤30 % stained cells) was observed in almost 50 % of cases, with increasing rates in lower IHC categories, and did not affect treatment outcome. The polysomy rate was 4 %.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: HER2 expression varies by tumor location and type. All patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should be tested for HER2 status, preferably using IHC initially.
randomized controlled trial	Due to the unique characteristics of gastric cancer, specific testing/scoring guidelines should be adhered to.
randomized controlled trial	HER2 screening data from ToGA: targeting HER2 in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	According to the ToGA trial, HER2 has been shown to be predictive for the success of treatment with trastuzumab in advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	A number of studies have analyzed HER-2/neu overexpression in gastric carcinoma and identified the rate of HER2 positivity to be markedly varied. To date, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression in Sicilian people with AGC is unknown.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Therefore, in the present study, a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of HER2 was performed in a cohort of 304 AGC samples that were obtained from the archives of 10 Sicilian anatomopathological diagnostic units in order to verify the positive rate of HER2-positive cases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Furthermore, the characteristics of histotype, grade, stage and Ki-67 expression were also analyzed. HER2 overexpression was encountered in 17.
Non-randomized controlled trial	43% of all the gastric adenocarcinomas, which was consistent with the results that have been reported elsewhere in the literature.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A progressive increase in HER2 overexpression was observed, from the poorly cohesive histotype to the tubular adenocarcinomas and gastric hepatoid adenocarcinomas.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 overexpression was significantly associated with a high grade, advanced stage and high Ki-67 labeling index.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Further investigations performed jointly by pathologists and oncologists within the geographical area of the present study should confirm that the association of trastuzumab with chemotherapy results in an improvement of survival in patients with AGC.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 status in advanced gastric carcinoma: A retrospective multicentric analysis from Sicily
Non-randomized controlled trial	Aims: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression/amplification is implicated in the development of various solid tumour types.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Validated methods and scoring systems for evaluating HER2 status exist in breast cancer, but not in gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The aim was to establish a HER2 scoring system for gastric cancer to identify suitable patients for enrollment in a trial of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in advanced metastatic gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods and results: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples were tested for HER2 status using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) pharmDxt kit (Dako Denmark A/S).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the HercepTest (Dako). Concordance between FISH and IHC was 93. 5% in 168 evaluable samples. Eleven samples were scored as FISH+ but IHC- or equivocal.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: IHC/FISH discrepancies were attributed to basolateral membranous immunoreactivity of glandular cells resulting in incomplete membranous reactivity and/or a higher rate of tumour heterogeneity in gastric cancer compared with breast cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	With modifications to the IHC scoring system, the HercepTest is considered valid for the identification of HER2+ gastric tumours for this clinical trial.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Correlation of HER2 scores with clinical outcomes will be needed to determine which patients might benefit from trastuzumab therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Assessment of a HER2 scoring system for gastric cancer: results from a validation study
Non-randomized controlled trial	Trastuzumab-based therapy has been shown to confer overall survival benefit in HER2-positive patients with advanced gastric cancer in a large multicentric trial (ToGA study).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Subgroup analysis identified adenocarcinomas of the stomach and gastroesophageal (GE) junction with overexpression of HER2 according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) as potential responders.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Due to recent approval of trastuzumab for HER2 positive metastatic gastric and GE-junction cancer in Europe (EMEA) HER2 diagnostics is now mandatory with IHC being the primary test followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in IHC2+ cases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, in order to not miss patients potentially responding to targeted therapy determination of a HER2-positive status for gastric cancer required modification of scoring as had been proposed in a pre-ToGA study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	To validate this new HER2 status testing procedure in terms of inter-laboratory and inter-observer consensus for IHC scoring a series of 547 gastric cancer tissue samples on a tissue microarray (TMA) was used.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In the first step, 30 representative cores were used to identify specific IHC HER2 scoring issues among eight French and German laboratories, while in the second step the full set of 547 cores was used to determine IHC HER2 intensity and area score concordance between six German pathologists.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Specific issues relating to discordance were identified and recommendations formulated which proved to be effective to reliably determine HER2 status in a prospective test series of 447 diagnostic gastric cancer specimens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 diagnostics in gastric cancer-guideline validation and development of standardized immunohistochemical testing
randomized controlled trial	Purpose To compare standard-of-care (SoC) trastuzumab plus chemotherapy with higher-dose (HD) trastuzumab plus chemotherapy to investigate whether HD trastuzumab increases trastuzumab serum trough concentration (Ctrough) levels and increases overall survival (OS) in first-line human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and Methods Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, no prior gastrectomy, and ≥ two metastatic sites were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by SoC trastuzumab maintenance 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks or loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by HD trastuzumab maintenance 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until progression; treatment in each arm was combined with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 plus capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice per day in cycles 1 to 6.
randomized controlled trial	The primary objective was HD trastuzumab OS superiority (all randomly assigned patients [full-analysis set]). Final results are from an interim analysis for futility (boundary hazard ratio [HR] ≥ 0. 95) at 125 deaths.
randomized controlled trial	Results At clinical cutoff, 248 patients had been randomly assigned. A marked increase in mean trastuzumab Ctrough was observed after the first HD trastuzumab cycle versus SoC trastuzumab. In the full-analysis set, median OS was 12.
randomized controlled trial	5 months in the SoC trastuzumab arm and 10. 6 months in the HD trastuzumab arm (stratified HR, 1. 24; 95% CI, 0. 86 to 1. 78; P =. 2401). Results were similar in the per-protocol set (cycle 1 trastuzumab Ctrough < 12 µg/mL).
randomized controlled trial	Safety was comparable between arms. Conclusion HD trastuzumab maintenance dosing was associated with higher trastuzumab concentrations, no increased efficacy, and no new safety signals.
randomized controlled trial	HELOISE confirms standard-dose trastuzumab (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose every 3 weeks) with chemotherapy as the SoC for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	HELOISE: Phase IIIb Randomized Multicenter Study Comparing Standard-of-Care and Higher-Dose Trastuzumab Regimens Combined With Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
randomized controlled trial	According to the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus cisplatin and capecitabine/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is standard first-line treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced oesophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	We examined the relative efficacy and safety of alternative trastuzumab-based cytotoxic backbone regimens compared to the standard ToGA regimen using meta-analysis.
randomized controlled trial	We searched Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL and ASCO and ESMO up to March 2017 for studies investigating alternative first-line trastuzumab-based regimens for HER2-positive oesophagogastric cancer, defined as high protein expression IHC3+ or IHC2+ and gene amplification by in situ hybridisation.
randomized controlled trial	We compared primary outcome overall survival (OS) of alternative trastuzumab-based regimens to the ToGA regimen. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated by extraction of the published Kaplan-Meier curves.
randomized controlled trial	Incidence counts and toxicity sample-sizes were extracted for adverse events and compared using single-arm proportion meta-analysis in R. Fifteen studies (N = 557 patients) were included.
randomized controlled trial	OS was significantly longer with regimen trastuzumab plus doublet oxaliplatin and capecitabine/5-FU (median OS = 20. 7 months) versus ToGA (16. 0 months, HR = 0. 75, 95% CI = 0. 59-0. 99) and was less toxic.
randomized controlled trial	Trastuzumab plus doublet cisplatin and S-1 showed no OS difference versus ToGA, but showed a different toxicity profile, including less hand-foot syndrome.
randomized controlled trial	Trastuzumab plus cisplatin or capecitabine as singlet backbone showed significantly worse survival and more toxicity versus ToGA regimen.
randomized controlled trial	Trastuzumab with triplet cytotoxic backbones or with bevacizumab and doublet cytotoxic backbone showed no survival benefit and more toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	In conclusion, trastuzumab plus doublet cytotoxic backbone containing oxaliplatin is preferable over the ToGA regimen with cisplatin. S-1 can substitute capecitabine or 5-FU when specific toxicities are encountered.
randomized controlled trial	Comparing cytotoxic backbones for first-line trastuzumab-containing regimens in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced oesophagogastric cancer: A meta-analysis
randomized controlled trial	Importance: Capecitabine is an oral cytotoxic chemotherapeutic commonly used across cancer subtypes. As with other oral medications though, it may suffer from drug interactions that could impair its absorption.
randomized controlled trial	Objective: To determine if gastric acid suppressants such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may impair capecitabine efficacy.
randomized controlled trial	Design, setting, and participants: This secondary analysis of TRIO-013, a phase III randomized trial, compares capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx) with or without lapatinib in 545 patients with ERBB2/HER2-positive metastatic gastroesophageal cancer (GEC); patients were randomized 1:1 between CapeOx with or without lapatinib.
randomized controlled trial	Proton pump inhibitor use was identified by medication records. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients treated with PPIs vs patients who were not.
randomized controlled trial	Specific subgroups were accounted for, such as younger age (<60 years), Asian ethnicity, female sex, and disease stage (metastatic/advanced) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling.
randomized controlled trial	The TRIO-013 trial accrued and randomized patients between June 2008 and January 2012; this analysis took place in January 2014. Interventions: Patients were divided based on PPI exposure.
randomized controlled trial	Main outcomes and measures: Primary study outcome was PFS and OS between patients treated with PPIs vs patients who were not. Secondary outcomes included disease response rates and toxicities.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 545 patients with GEC (median age, 60 years; 406 men [74%]) included in the study, 229 received PPIs (42. 0%) and were evenly distributed between arms. In the placebo arm, PPI-treated patients had poorer median PFS, 4. 2 vs 5.
randomized controlled trial	7 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 55; 95% CI, 1. 29-1. 81, P <. 001); OS, 9. 2 vs 11. 3 months (HR, 1. 34; 95% CI, 1. 06-1. 62; P =. 04); and disease control rate (83% vs 72%; P =. 02) vs patients not treated with PPIs.
randomized controlled trial	In multivariate analysis considering age, race, disease stage, and sex, PPI-treated patients had poorer PFS (HR, 1. 68; 95% CI, 1. 42-1. 94; P <. 001) and OS (HR, 1. 41; 95% CI, 1. 11-1. 71; P =. 001).
randomized controlled trial	In patients treated with CapeOx and lapatinib, PPIs had less effect on PFS (HR, 1. 08; P =. 54) and OS (HR, 1. 26; P =. 10); however, multivariate analysis in this group demonstrated a significant difference in OS (HR, 1. 38; 95% CI, 1. 06-1. 66; P =.
randomized controlled trial	03). Conclusions and relevance: Proton pump inhibitors negatively effected capecitabine efficacy by possibly raising gastric pH levels, leading to altered dissolution and absorption.
randomized controlled trial	These results are consistent with previous erlotinib and sunitinib studies. Whether PPIs affected lapatinib is unclear given concurrent capecitabine.
randomized controlled trial	Given capecitabine's prevalence in treatment breast cancer and colon cancer, further studies are under way. Trial registration: clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00680901.
randomized controlled trial	Association of Proton Pump Inhibitors and Capecitabine Efficacy in Advanced Gastroesophageal Cancer: Secondary Analysis of the TRIO-013/LOGiC Randomized Clinical Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Capecitabine is used to treat colorectal (CRC) cancer. TRIO-013, a study examining capecitabine/oxaliplatin ± lapatinib in metastatic gastro-esophageal cancer did not show increases in overall survival (OS) with lapatinib.
randomized controlled trial	An analysis showed concurrent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) usage negatively impacted recurrence-free survival (RFS). We retrospectively studied PPI effects on capecitabine efficacy in early stage CRC and how capecitabine adjustments impacted RFS.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Early stage CRC patients taking monotherapy capecitabine treated from 2008 to 2012 were reviewed for demographics, medications, toxicities, and patient outcomes. Results: Of 298 identified patients, 25. 8% (n = 77) received concurrent PPIs.
randomized controlled trial	Five-year RFS was 74% versus 83% (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 07-3. 35; P =. 03) in PPI versus non-PPI patients respectively. OS was 81% versus 78%, respectively (HR, 1. 13; 95% CI, 0. 60-2. 14; P =. 7).
randomized controlled trial	After accounting for gender, stage, age, and performance status, PPI patients tended toward decreased RFS (HR, 1. 65; 95% CI, 0. 93-2. 94; P =. 09). Capecitabine dose modifications affected outcomes.
randomized controlled trial	Five-year RFS was 84% in the control group, 100% in the treatment-delay group (P =. 99), 67% in the dose reduction group (HR, 2. 46; 95% CI, 1. 23-4. 93; P =. 01), and 64% in the discontinuation group (HR, 2. 27; 95% CI, 0. 93-5. 53; P =. 07).
randomized controlled trial	Five-year OS was significantly less in the discontinuation group than control group (59% vs. 82%; HR, 3. 27; 95% CI, 1. 44-7. 45; P =. 005).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: PPIs appear to impact RFS; this may be due to PPIs preventing capecitabine tablet dissolution and absorption.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with dose reductions or who stopped treatment had worse outcomes than patients who continued with treatment at starting doses.
randomized controlled trial	Concomitant Administration of Proton Pump Inhibitors and Capecitabine is Associated With Increased Recurrence Risk in Early Stage Colorectal Cancer Patients
randomized controlled trial	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) amplification or overexpression occurs in approximately 20% of advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinomas1-3.
randomized controlled trial	More than a decade ago, combination therapy with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab and chemotherapy became the standard first-line treatment for patients with these types of tumours4.
randomized controlled trial	Although adding the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab to chemotherapy does not significantly improve efficacy in advanced HER2-negative gastric cancer5, there are preclinical6-19 and clinical20,21 rationales for adding pembrolizumab in HER2-positive disease.
randomized controlled trial	Here we describe results of the protocol-specified first interim analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III KEYNOTE-811 study of pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic, HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma22 ( https://clinicaltrials.
randomized controlled trial	gov , NCT03615326). We show that adding pembrolizumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy markedly reduces tumour size, induces complete responses in some participants, and significantly improves objective response rate.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is a lethal disease where targeted therapies, even when guided by genomic biomarkers, have had limited efficacy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A potential reason for the failure of such therapies is that genomic profiling results could commonly differ between the primary and metastatic tumors.
Non-randomized controlled trial	To evaluate genomic heterogeneity, we sequenced paired primary GEA and synchronous metastatic lesions across multiple cohorts, finding extensive differences in genomic alterations, including discrepancies in potentially clinically relevant alterations.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Multiregion sequencing showed significant discrepancy within the primary tumor (PT) and between the PT and disseminated disease, with oncogene amplification profiles commonly discordant.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In addition, a pilot analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing demonstrated the feasibility of detecting genomic amplifications not detected in PT sampling.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Lastly, we profiled paired primary tumors, metastatic tumors, and cfDNA from patients enrolled in the personalized antibodies for GEA (PANGEA) trial of targeted therapies in GEA and found that genomic biomarkers were recurrently discrepant between the PT and untreated metastases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Divergent primary and metastatic tissue profiling led to treatment reassignment in 32% (9/28) of patients. In discordant primary and metastatic lesions, we found 87.
Non-randomized controlled trial	5% concordance for targetable alterations in metastatic tissue and cfDNA, suggesting the potential for cfDNA profiling to enhance selection of therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Significance: We demonstrate frequent baseline heterogeneity in targetable genomic alterations in GEA, indicating that current tissue sampling practices for biomarker testing do not effectively guide precision medicine in this disease and that routine profiling of metastatic lesions and/or cfDNA should be systematically evaluated.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Genomic Heterogeneity as a Barrier to Precision Medicine in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
meta analysis	Importance: Intratumoral heterogeneity has been recognized as a significant barrier in successfully developing targetable biomarkers for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) and may affect neoadjuvant precision medicine approaches.
meta analysis	Objective: To describe intratumoral spatial heterogeneity of tumor cell populations in nonmetastatic GEA and its association with survival.
meta analysis	Design, setting, and participants: This case series retrospectively identified 41 patients with GEA who underwent up-front surgical resection at a tertiary referral cancer center from January 1, 1989, through December 31, 2013.
meta analysis	Survival was calculated from date of surgery to date of death through June 1, 2017. Data were analyzed from June 2, 2017, to March 1, 2019.
meta analysis	Main outcomes and measures: Overall survival, intratumoral clonal composition determined by genomic single-nucleotide variation array and bioinformatic analysis, and intercellular tumoral distances determined by multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization.
meta analysis	Results: Among the 41 patients included in the analysis (22 men [54%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [12] years), a high proportion (19 [46%]) presented with tumors possessing high intratumoral heterogeneity.
meta analysis	Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that cases with an intratumoral clonal composition count of at least 2 exhibited worse survival compared with cases with a clonal composition count of 0 to 1 (univariate hazard ratio, 3. 92; 95% CI, 1. 27-12.
meta analysis	08; P =. 02). This finding remained significant on multivariate analysis controlling for stage, Lauren histologic subtype, receipt of adjuvant therapy, and age (multivariate hazard ratio, 4. 55; 95% CI, 1. 09-19. 04; P =. 04).
meta analysis	Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated intratumoral clonal populations coexisting at submillimeter distances with differing relevant oncogenic copy number alterations, such as EGFR, JAK2, FGFR2, MET, CCND1, KRAS, MYC, PIK3CA, CD274, and PDCD1LG2.
meta analysis	Conclusions and relevance: This study found that spatial intratumoral heterogeneity of oncogenic copy number alterations exists before metastatic dissemination, and increased heterogeneity was associated with worse outcomes in resected GEA.
meta analysis	Baseline heterogeneity illustrates the challenges in GEA targeted therapy. Further study may offer insight into strategies on combinatorial and/or sequential targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches.
meta analysis	Association Between Spatial Heterogeneity Within Nonmetastatic Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinomas and Survival
Non-randomized controlled trial	Aims: To determine the extent of HER2 homogeneity/heterogeneity in primary versus metastatic gastric carcinoma (GC).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Materials and results: The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in primary and metastatic lesions was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Four separate cohorts consisting of primary GC alone or primary GC paired with metastatic lesions were examined. In the FISH analysis of 325 primary GCs, eight cases (2. 5%) showed amplification with a heterogeneous pattern, whereas 27 cases (8.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3%) showed amplification with a homogeneous pattern, and in this cohort the discordant:concordant FISH ratio based on examination of three different areas in each primary lesion was 0. 30:1.
Non-randomized controlled trial	FISH testing using 250 paired primary and metastatic lesions revealed seven cases (2. 8%) with discordant amplification. In metastatic disease positive conversion occurred in six cases (2. 4%), whereas negative conversion happened in one case (0. 4%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The discordant:concordant ratio of primary versus secondary lesions was 0. 23:1. When the seven discordant cases were re-evaluated using whole sections of primary GCs, six showed a heterogeneous pattern of amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: These findings suggest that the discordant HER2 amplification observed in metastatic lesions is explained substantially by heterogeneity within primary tumours.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Heterogeneous amplification of ERBB2 in primary lesions is responsible for the discordant ERBB2 status of primary and metastatic lesions in gastric carcinoma
meta analysis	Aim: To evaluate the clinical significance of intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity in gastric cancer (GC).
meta analysis	Methods: A total of 322 GC tissues were evaluated by HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC), of which 73 with IHC 2+ or 3+ were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH).
meta analysis	Also, 3-5 distinct spots in each case showing different HER2 staining intensities were evaluated individually by comparing IHC staining intensity with gene copy number (GCN). Minimum, average and maximum FISH scores were generated for each case.
meta analysis	Results: Intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 overexpression and gene amplification were 54 and 30 of 73 cases with IHC 2+ or 3+, respectively. These cases were characterised by diffuse or mixed Lauren type, HER2 IHC 2+, and low-level amplification.
meta analysis	Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the heterogeneous overexpression was significantly associated with longer disease-free survival times than the homogeneous, and the high average GCN was most associated with poor outcome.
meta analysis	Also, there was a strong correlation between the IHC and FISH results for each spot.
meta analysis	Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the cancer tissues and the cell-free plasma showed that HER2 gene copy by quantitative PCR on tissue correlated well with those by FISH, but plasma HER2 level was not.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Considering the high incidence of intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity in GC, accurate HER2 assessment would require larger tissues and more detailed guidelines.
meta analysis	The guidelines should include the recommendation that FISH-scoring areas be selected with reference to a corresponding IHC slide. Also, the definition of HER2-positive tumours should be reassessed considering the intratumoral heterogeneity.
meta analysis	Clinical significance of intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity in gastric cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The intratumoural heterogeneity of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression in gastric cancer is a major challenge when identifying patients who might benefit from HER2-targeting therapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We investigated the significance of re-evaluation of HER2 status in primary sites and metastatic or recurrent sites in advanced gastric cancer patients whose primary tumours were initially HER2-negative.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In part I of this study, we evaluated the significance of repeat endoscopic biopsy in unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer patients whose tumours were initially HER2-negative.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In part II, we examined the HER2 positivity rate in metastatic or recurrent sites in patients whose primary tumours were HER2-negative in biopsy or surgical specimens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: In part I (n = 183), we identified patients with HER2-positive tumours for a rescued HER2 positivity rate of 8. 7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4. 6-12.
Non-randomized controlled trial	8%) that was associated with tumour location (diffuse stomach versus other = 0% versus 11. 7%, P = 0. 013), Bormann type (IV versus others = 0% versus 11. 7%, P = 0. 013), and initial biopsy HER2 immunohistochemistry score (0 versus 1 versus 2=6.
Non-randomized controlled trial	7% versus 15. 4% versus 25. 0%, P = 0. 028). Part II (n = 175) resulted in HER2 positivity of 5. 7% (95% CI 2. 3-9. 1%) that was significantly associated with metastatic site (liver versus others = 17. 2% versus 3. 4%, P = 0. 012).
Non-randomized controlled trial	When compared with a historical control that showed HER2 positivity on initial assessment, patients who had rescued HER2 positivity had similar treatment benefits from trastuzumab-containing first-line chemotherapy.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Repeat HER2 assessment in primary and metastatic or recurrent sites is recommended in patients with advanced gastric cancer whose primary tumour is initially HER2-negative.

Case series	Background: We evaluated the risk of sampling errors in specimens of biopsy size, which may be caused by heterogeneous overexpression of Her2/neu in gastric cancer (GC).
Case series	Patients and methods: The study cohort comprised 454 gastrectomy patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophago-gastric junction.
Case series	Tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) served as 'biopsy procedure' and were generated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue: five tissue cylinders were collected randomly from each tumor, rendering 2230 core cylinders.
Case series	These were compared with 454 whole tissue sections obtained from the same paraffin blocks. Her2/neu expression and gene amplification were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.
Case series	The Her2/neu status was determined according to GC scoring system by two independent observers. Results: In whole tissue sections, 37 (8. 1%; observer 1) and 38 (8. 4%; observer 2) of the GCs, and in the corresponding TMAs, 28 (6.
Case series	3%; observer 1) and 28 (6. 3%; observer 2) of the GCs were classified as Her2/neu-positive (kappa value 98. 5% and 96. 2%; P < 0001).
Case series	Comparison of whole tissue sections with corresponding TMAs showed a false-negative rate of 24% and a false-positive rate of 3% for TMAs.
Case series	Conclusion: Assessment of the Her2/neu status in tissue biopsies carries a significant risk of sampling errors, thereby rendering patients unsuitable for treatment with trastuzumab.
Case series	Her2/neu testing in gastric cancer: evaluating the risk of sampling errors
meta analysis	Based on data from a large multicenter phase III trial (ToGA study) trastuzumab has very recently been approved by the EMEA for metastatic gastric cancer and adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction.
meta analysis	Only patients with tumors which over express Her2 as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory FISH+ result, or IHC 3+, determined by an accurate and validated assay are eligible for trastuzumab therapy.
meta analysis	However, testing of Her2 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) differs from breast cancer in core aspects: 1. IHC2+/3+ is scored even though membranous staining is incomplete if membrane staining is clearly detectable even at low magnification (2.
meta analysis	5x/5x, 3+) or medium magnification (10x/20x, 2+). 2. Additionally, membrane staining at the appropriate intensity found in at least 10% of tumor cells is restricted to resection specimens.
meta analysis	Evaluation of Her2 in situ hybridization (ISH) is similar to breast cancer with ratio values of > or =2. 0 indicating Her2 gene amplification.
meta analysis	Taking these modifications into account and defining the HER2 positive subgroup as IHC 3+ and IHC2+/FISH+, approximately 16% of gastric cancers are considered Her2 positive, affecting mainly tumor regions with intestinal (gland forming) type carcinoma.
meta analysis	In contrast to breast cancer, up to one-third of gastric cancers show a heterogeneous Her2 status both at IHC and ISH levels which favors bright field ISH over FISH.
meta analysis	[Her2 testing in gastric cancer. What is different in comparison to breast cancer?]
meta analysis	Aims: To assess human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and heterogeneity using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver in-situ hybridization (SISH) in gastric carcinoma and dysplasia, and to correlate HER2 status between biopsy and resection specimens of gastric carcinoma.
meta analysis	Methods and results: Immunohistochemistry for HER2 was performed in 178 cases of gastric carcinoma, and SISH in cases showing at least 1+ reaction. HER2 positivity [European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines] was identified in 20.
meta analysis	2% of carcinomas and 12. 9% of high-grade dysplasia, and HER2 heterogeneity noted in 50% and 33% of these cases, respectively. IHC negative/positive reactivity and SISH results were concordant in 96. 2%. SISH amplification was seen in 35.
meta analysis	3% of IHC 2+ and in a case with previously unrecognized staining pattern. Concordance of IHC HER2 status on biopsies and gastrectomies was seen in 74. 1%. False negative IHC results on either the biopsy or gastrectomy were seen in 19.
meta analysis	4% of HER2 amplified cases.
meta analysis	Conclusions: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status in gastric carcinoma is comparable to previous studies with good concordance between IHC and SISH; all IHC 2+ and unusual patterns should be assessed with ISH studies; heterogeneity of tumour HER2 overexpression/amplification is common with possible implications for HER2 testing; and HER2 overexpression appears sufficiently specific to be considered a potential diagnostic biomarker of dysplasia.
meta analysis	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in gastric carcinoma: issues related to heterogeneity in biopsies and resections
Non-randomized controlled trial	A monoclonal antibody to HER2 protein is widely used in the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and has also been found to exhibit antitumor activity in human gastric cancer cells that overexpress HER2.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of HER2 overexpression and concordance between the results for protein expression and gene amplification in both surgical and biopsy specimens of gastric cancer as assessed with two commercial kits, one for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the other for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The specimens consisted of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of biopsy specimens and surgically resected tumors from 200 cases of invasive gastric cancer that had been treated surgically at the National Cancer Center Hospital East.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The lesions were analyzed with the IHC kit, and expression was graded by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved grading system. Gene amplification was evaluated by FISH.
Non-randomized controlled trial	IHC revealed HER2 overexpression in 46 of the 200 (23%) cases. The FISH assay was technically successful in 199 cases (99. 5%), and gene amplification was observed in 54 cases (27. 1%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The concordance rate between the results obtained by IHC and FISH was 86. 9%. The concordance rate between the findings in the surgically resected tumors and the 200 pre-treatment biopsy specimens was 88. 7%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 expression can be assessed in gastric cancer with a commercial kit as previously reported in breast cancer. Even small biopsy specimens were found to be suitable for evaluating gastric cancer for HER2 overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Comparison of HER2 gene amplification assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and HER2 protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry in gastric cancer
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Trastuzumab has recently shown efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although antibody-based therapies target the metastatic disease, HER2 status is usually evaluated in the primary tumour because metastatic sites are rarely biopsied.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The aim of this study was to compare HER2 status in primary and paired metastatic sites of gastric adenocarcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: The HER2 status was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 72 secondary lesions of gastric adenocarcinoma and in the corresponding primary tumours.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Concordance of FISH results, evaluable in 68 primary and matched metastatic sites, was 98. 5%. Concordance of IHC results, available in 39 of the 72 paired cases, was 94. 9%.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Only one case showed discordance between primary tumour and metastasis, being negative by both IHC and FISH in the primary and showing HER2 overexpression and amplification in the corresponding pancreatic lymph node metastasis.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: The high concordance observed between HER2 results obtained by both IHC and FISH on primary tumours and corresponding metastases suggests that in gastric cancer HER2 status is maintained in most cases unchanged during the metastatic process.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Comparison of HER2 status in primary and paired metastatic sites of gastric carcinoma
randomized controlled trial	Background: Trastuzumab has been approved for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic gastric carcinoma; however, relatively little is known about the role of HER2 in the natural history of this disease.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients enrolled in the INT-0116/SWOG9008 phase III gastric cancer clinical trial with available tissue specimens were retrospectively evaluated for HER2 gene amplification by FISH and overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
randomized controlled trial	The original trial was designed to evaluate the benefit of postoperative chemoradiation compared with surgery alone. Results: HER2 gene amplification rate by FISH was 10. 9% among 258 patients evaluated. HER2 overexpression rate by IHC was 12.
randomized controlled trial	2% among 148 patients evaluated, with 90% agreement between FISH and IHC. There was a significant interaction between HER2 amplification and treatment with respect to both disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0. 020) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.
randomized controlled trial	034). Among patients with HER2-non-amplified cancers, treated patients had a median OS of 44 months compared with 24 months in the surgery-only arm (P = 0. 003).
randomized controlled trial	Among patients with HER2-amplified cancers, there was no significant difference in survival based on treatment arm. HER2 status was not a prognostic marker among patients who received no postoperative chemoradiation.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Patients lacking HER2 amplification benefited from treatment as indicated by both DFS and OS. Clinical trial: INT-0116/SWOG9008 phase III.

Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification are important biomarkers for identifying gastric cancer patients who may respond to HER2-targeted therapy using trastuzumab.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The aim of this study was to evaluate the concordance between HER2 protein expression and gene amplification in both surgically resected tumors and matched biopsy specimens of gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 207 surgically resected tumors and 158 biopsy specimens from 207 cases of invasive intestinal-type gastric cancer were analyzed.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Protein expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry and graded by the modified scoring criteria for gastric cancer. Gene amplification was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 overexpression was observed in 17 % of both surgically resected tumors (35/207) and biopsy specimens (26/158). HER2 gene amplification was detected in 31 % (61/200) of surgically resected tumors and 32 % (47/147) of biopsy specimens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Except for immunohistochemistry (IHC) equivocal (2+) cases, the concordance rates between IHC and FISH was 90. 9 % in surgically resected tumors and 90. 2 % in biopsy specimens.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In IHC 2+ cases, the rate of HER2 gene amplification was 56 and 38 % in surgically resected tumors and biopsy specimens, respectively. IHC-FISH discordance was mainly due to intratumoral heterogeneity and low-level gene amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The concordance rate of IHC results between surgically resected specimens and the corresponding biopsy specimen was 57. 0 % (κ = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	224), and in discordant cases, HER2 positivity in biopsies and HER2 negativity in surgically resected tumors were most common. The concordance rate of FISH results between surgically resected tumors and biopsy specimens was 72. 7 % (κ = 0. 313).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Polysomy 17 was detected in 5. 5 and 7. 5 % of surgically resected tumors and biopsy specimens and significantly correlated with IHC score, but polysomy 17 could explain one IHC score 3+ and FISH-negative tumor only.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Although high concordance rates between HER2-protein expression and gene amplification were observed in both surgically resected tumors and biopsy specimens, the agreement levels were evaluated to be fair.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Polysomy 17 was infrequent and seemed to have limited impact on gastric HER2 testing.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Further investigations are required for an appropriate biopsy method to reduce false results of HER2 testing and to clarify the clinical significance of intratumoral heterogeneity in HER2 status.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Aim: To investigate human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and protein expression in mixed gastric carcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to detect HER2 amplification and protein expression in 277 cases of mixed gastric carcinoma. Protein staining intensity was rate as 1+, 2+, or 3+.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 277 cases, 114 (41. 2%) expressed HER2 protein. HER2 3+ staining was observed in 28/277 (10. 1%) cases, 2+ in 37/277 (13. 4%) cases, and 1+ in 49/277 (17. 7%) cases. A HER2 amplification rate of 17% was detected, of which 25/28 (89.
Non-randomized controlled trial	3%) were observed in the HER2 3+ staining group, 17/37 (45. 9%) in 2+, and 5/49 (10. 2%) in 1+. Of the 47 patients with HER2 amplification who received chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, 22 demonstrated median progression-free and overall survivals of 9.
Non-randomized controlled trial	1 mo and 16. 7 mo, respectively, which were significantly better than those achieved with chemotherapy alone (5. 6 mo and 12. 1 mo, respectively) in 19 previously treated patients (Ps < 0. 05).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: HER2 detection in mixed gastric carcinoma displays high heterogeneity. Relatively quantitative parameters are needed for assessing the level of HER2 amplification and protein expression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression in mixed gastric carcinoma
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: In esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), concordance and prognostic significance of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) protein overexpression and gene amplification are equivocal, which led us to reevaluate this by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Methods: One hundred and fifty-four patients were included in a tissue micro array (TMA). HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by fluorescence and silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (FISH and SISH) and expression with the HercepTest™.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: HER-2 was amplified in 16% by SISH and 18% by FISH. HER-2 positivity (IHC 3+ or 2+ with ISH+) was seen in 12% and overexpression (IHC 2+/3+) in 14%. Concordance was 92% between SISH/IHC, 90% between FISH/IHC and 95% between SISH/FISH.
Non-randomized controlled trial	All IHC 3+ cases were amplified by SISH and in 93% by FISH. Of the IHC 2+cases, this was 33% (SISH) and 50% (FISH). Of the IHC 1+ cases, still 6% (SISH) and 8% (FISH) showed amplification.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2 positivity, overexpression and amplification were all associated with poor cancer-specific survival, in univariate analysis.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Furthermore, HER-2 positivity and amplification (SISH) were independently associated with poor survival (hazard ratio, HR 6. 343; 95% CI 1. 218-36. 234; P = 0. 029 and HR 3. 231; 95% CI 1. 092-9. 563; P = 0. 034).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: HER-2 positivity and gene amplification are fairly frequent and independently associated with poor survival.

randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Trastuzumab is the only approved targeted drug for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). However, not all patients respond and most eventually progress.
randomized controlled trial	The multicenter VARIANZ study aimed to investigate the background of response and resistance to trastuzumab in mGC. Methods: Patients receiving medical treatment for mGC were prospectively recruited in 35 German sites and followed for up to 48 months.
randomized controlled trial	HER2 status was assessed centrally by immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridization. In addition, HER2 gene expression was assessed using qPCR.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Five hundred forty-eight patients were enrolled, and 77 had HER2+ mGC by central assessment (14. 1%). A high deviation rate of 22. 7% between central and local test results was seen.
randomized controlled trial	Patients who received trastuzumab for centrally confirmed HER2+ mGC (central HER2+/local HER2+) lived significantly longer as compared with patients who received trastuzumab for local HER2+ but central HER2- mGC (20. 5 months, n = 60 v 10.
randomized controlled trial	9 months, n = 65; hazard ratio, 0. 42; 95% CI, 8. 2 to 14. 4; P <. 001). In the centrally confirmed cohort, significantly more tumor cells stained HER2+ than in the unconfirmed cohort, and the HER2 amplification ratio was significantly higher.
randomized controlled trial	A minimum of 40% HER2+ tumor cells and a HER2 amplification ratio of ≥ 3. 0 were calculated as optimized thresholds for predicting benefit from trastuzumab.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Significant discrepancies in HER2 assessment of mGC were found in tumor specimens with intermediate HER2 expression.
randomized controlled trial	Borderline HER2 positivity and heterogeneity of HER2 expression should be considered as resistance factors for HER2-targeting treatment of mGC. HER2 thresholds should be reconsidered.
randomized controlled trial	Detailed reports with quantification of HER2 expression and amplification levels may improve selection of patients for HER2-directed treatment.
randomized controlled trial	HER2 Expression, Test Deviations, and Their Impact on Survival in Metastatic Gastric Cancer: Results From the Prospective Multicenter VARIANZ Study
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of adding lapatinib to capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx) in patients with previously untreated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -amplified advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with HER2-positive advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to CapeOx plus lapatinib 1,250 mg or placebo daily.
randomized controlled trial	Primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients with centrally confirmed HER2 amplification in the primary efficacy population.
randomized controlled trial	Results: A total of 545 patients were randomly assigned, and 487 patients comprised the primary efficacy population. Median OS in the lapatinib and placebo arms was 12. 2 (95% CI, 10. 6 to 14. 2) and 10. 5 months (95% CI, 9. 0 to 11.
randomized controlled trial	3), respectively, which was not significantly different (hazard ratio, 0. 91; 95% CI, 0. 73 to 1. 12). Median progression-free survival in the lapatinib and placebo arms was 6. 0 (95% CI, 5. 6 to 7. 0) and 5. 4 months (95% CI, 4. 4 to 5.
randomized controlled trial	7), respectively (hazard ratio, 0. 82; 95% CI, 0. 68 to 1. 00; P =. 0381). Response rate was significantly higher in the lapatinib arm: 53% (95% CI, 46. 4 to 58. 8) compared with 39% (95% CI, 32. 9 to 45. 3) in the placebo arm (P =. 0031).
randomized controlled trial	Preplanned exploratory subgroup analyses showed OS in the lapatinib arm was prolonged in Asian and younger patients. No correlation was observed between HER2 immunohistochemistry status and survival.
randomized controlled trial	There were increased toxicities in the lapatinib arm, particularly diarrhea. Conclusion: Addition of lapatinib to CapeOx did not increase OS in patients with HER2-amplified gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	There were clear differences in the effect of lapatinib depending on region and age. Future studies could examine this correlation.
randomized controlled trial	Lapatinib in Combination With Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Advanced or Metastatic Gastric, Esophageal, or Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma: TRIO-013/LOGiC--A Randomized Phase III Trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: Patients with advanced gastric cancer have a poor prognosis and few efficacious treatment options.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to assess the addition of cetuximab to capecitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In our open-label, randomised phase 3 trial (EXPAND), we enrolled adults aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable (M0) or metastatic (M1) adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction.
randomized controlled trial	We enrolled patients at 164 sites (teaching hospitals and clinics) in 25 countries, and randomly assigned eligible participants (1:1) to receive first-line chemotherapy with or without cetuximab.
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was done with a permuted block randomisation procedure (variable block size), stratified by disease stage (M0 vs M1), previous oesophagectomy or gastrectomy (yes vs no), and previous (neo)adjuvant (radio)chemotherapy (yes vs no).
randomized controlled trial	Treatment consisted of 3-week cycles of twice-daily capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) (on days 1-14) and intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) (on day 1), with or without weekly cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) initial infusion on day 1 followed by 250 mg/m(2) per week thereafter).
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by a masked independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.
randomized controlled trial	This study is registered at EudraCT, number 2007-004219-75. Findings: Between June 30, 2008, and Dec 15, 2010, we enrolled 904 patients. Median PFS for 455 patients allocated capecitabine-cisplatin plus cetuximab was 4. 4 months (95% CI 4. 2-5.
randomized controlled trial	5) compared with 5. 6 months (5. 1-5. 7) for 449 patients who were allocated to receive capecitabine-cisplatin alone (hazard ratio 1. 09, 95% CI 0. 92-1. 29; p=0. 32).
randomized controlled trial	369 (83%) of 446 patients in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group and 337 (77%) of 436 patients in the chemotherapy group had grade 3-4 adverse events, including grade 3-4 diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, rash, and hand-foot syndrome.
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3-4 neutropenia was more common in controls than in patients who received cetuximab. Incidence of grade 3-4 skin reactions and acne-like rash was substantially higher in the cetuximab-containing regimen than in the control regimen.
randomized controlled trial	239 (54%) of 446 in the cetuximab group and 194 (44%) of 436 in the control group had any grade of serious adverse event.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Addition of cetuximab to capecitabine-cisplatin provided no additional benefit to chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer in our trial. Funding: Merck KGaA.
randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine and cisplatin with or without cetuximab for patients with previously untreated advanced gastric cancer (EXPAND): a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: EGFR overexpression occurs in 27-55% of oesophagogastric adenocarcinomas, and correlates with poor prognosis.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to assess addition of the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab to epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (EOC) in patients with advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this randomised, open-label phase 3 trial (REAL3), we enrolled patients with untreated, metastatic, or locally advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma at 63 centres (tertiary referral centres, teaching hospitals, and district general hospitals) in the UK.
randomized controlled trial	Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive up to eight 21-day cycles of open-label EOC (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 and capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-21) or modified-dose EOC plus panitumumab (mEOC+P; epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 1, capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-21, and panitumumab 9 mg/kg on day 1).
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was blocked and stratified for centre region, extent of disease, and performance status. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. After a preplanned independent data monitoring committee review in October, 2011, trial recruitment was halted and panitumumab withdrawn.
randomized controlled trial	Data for patients on treatment were censored at this timepoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00824785. Findings: Between June 2, 2008, and Oct 17, 2011, we enrolled 553 eligible patients.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival in 275 patients allocated EOC was 11. 3 months (95% CI 9. 6-13. 0) compared with 8. 8 months (7. 7-9. 8) in 278 patients allocated mEOC+P (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 37, 95% CI 1. 07-1. 76; p=0. 013).
randomized controlled trial	mEOC+P was associated with increased incidence of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (48 [17%] of 276 patients allocated mEOC+P vs 29 [11%] of 266 patients allocated EOC), rash (29 [11%] vs two [1%]), mucositis (14 [5%] vs none), and hypomagnesaemia (13 [5%] vs none) but reduced incidence of haematological toxicity (grade ≥ 3 neutropenia 35 [13%] vs 74 [28%]).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: Addition of panitumumab to EOC chemotherapy does not increase overall survival and cannot be recommended for use in an unselected population with advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.

randomized controlled trial	Epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine with or without panitumumab for patients with previously untreated advanced oesophagogastric cancer (REAL3): a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The AVAGAST study showed that adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer improves progression-free survival and tumor response rate but not overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	To examine the hypothesis that angiogenic markers may have predictive value for bevacizumab efficacy in gastric cancer, AVAGAST included a prospective, mandatory biomarker program.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer were randomly assigned to bevacizumab (n = 387) or placebo (n = 387) in combination with chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Blood and tumor tissue samples were collected at baseline. Prespecified biomarkers included plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), protein expression of neuropilin-1, and VEGF receptors-1 and -2 (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2).
randomized controlled trial	Correlations between biomarkers and clinical outcomes were assessed by using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Plasma was available from 712 patients (92%), and tumor samples were available from 727 patients (94%).
randomized controlled trial	Baseline plasma VEGF-A levels and tumor neuropilin-1 expression were identified as potential predictors of bevacizumab efficacy. Patients with high baseline plasma VEGF-A levels showed a trend toward improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.
randomized controlled trial	72; 95% CI, 0. 57 to 0. 93) versus patients with low VEGF-A levels (HR, 1. 01; 95% CI, 0. 77 to 1. 31; interaction P =. 07). Patients with low baseline expression of neuropilin-1 also showed a trend toward improved overall survival (HR, 0.
randomized controlled trial	75; 95% CI, 0. 59 to 0. 97) versus patients with high neuropilin-1 expression (HR, 1. 07; 95% CI, 0. 81 to 1. 40; interaction P =. 06). For both biomarkers, subgroup analyses demonstrated significance only in patients from non-Asian regions.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Plasma VEGF-A and tumor neuropilin-1 are strong biomarker candidates for predicting clinical outcome in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with bevacizumab.
randomized controlled trial	Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in advanced gastric cancer: a biomarker evaluation from the AVAGAST randomized phase III trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2 positivity are considered to be negative prognostic factors in gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Biomarker analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of EGFR and HER2 expression on the outcome of patients enrolled in the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC), a randomized controlled trial comparing postoperative adjuvant S-1 therapy with surgery alone in 1,059 patients with stage II/III gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Experimental design: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical specimens were retrospectively examined in 829 patients (78. 3%).
randomized controlled trial	The effects of EGFR and HER2 positivity on survival were analyzed on the basis of the 5-year survival data from the study.
randomized controlled trial	EGFR positivity was defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+, and HER2 positivity as an IHC score of 3+ or an IHC score of 2+ with a positive dual-color in situ hybridization status. Results: EGFR and HER2 were positive in 75 (9.
randomized controlled trial	0%) and 113 (13. 6%) patients, respectively. The overall and relapse-free survival rates were significantly lower in EGFR-positive patients than in EGFR-negative patients, whereas they were similar in HER2-positive and HER2-negative patients.
randomized controlled trial	Multivariate analysis showed that EGFR positivity correlated with poor outcomes [HR = 1. 504; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1. 020-2. 149; P = 0. 040].
randomized controlled trial	Treatment with S-1 improved survival compared with surgery alone, irrespective of EGFR and HER2 status.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: EGFR positivity, but not HER2 positivity, was associated with poor patient outcomes after curative resection of stage II/III gastric cancer. There was no interaction between S-1 and EGFR or HER2 status with respect to survival outcome.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: To determine whether human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is an independent prognostic factor in metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 381 metastatic gastric/GEJ cancer patients enrolled at Krankenhaus Nordwest and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centers on six first-line trials of chemotherapy without trastuzumab were examined for HER2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	IHC 3+ or ISH-positive tumors were considered HER2 positive. Results: Seventy-eight of 381 patients (20%) had HER2-positive disease.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In the multivariate logistic model, there were significantly higher rates of HER2 positivity in patients with liver metastasis (liver metastasis 31%; no liver metastasis 11%; P = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	025) and intestinal histology (intestinal 33%; diffuse/mixed 8%; P = 0. 001). No significant differences in HER2 positivity were found between resections and biopsies or primaries and metastases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer had longer median overall survival compared with HER2-negative gastric cancer patients (13. 9 versus 11. 4 months, P = 0.
Non-randomized controlled trial	047), but multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 status was not an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 0. 79; 0. 44-1. 14; P = 0. 194). Conclusions: Approximately 20% of Western patients with metastatic gastric cancer are HER2 positive.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Unlike breast cancer, HER2 positivity is not independently prognostic of patient outcome in metastatic gastric or GEJ.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: Perioperative epirubicin, cisplatin and fluorouracil (ECF) chemotherapy improves survival in operable oesophago-gastric cancer [Adjuvant Gastric Cancer Infusional Chemotherapy (MAGIC) trial HR 0. 75 (0. 6-0. 93)].
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 amplification is reported to predict enhanced benefit from anthracyclines in breast cancer. We sought to define whether HER2 predicts benefit from ECF in oesophago-gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Diagnostic biopsies and/or resection specimens were collected from 415 of 503 MAGIC trial patients (82. 5%).
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and brightfield dual in situ hybridisation (BDISH) in tissue microarrays. The prognostic and predictive impact of HER2 status was investigated.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: Concordance between HER2 over-expression (IHC3+) and amplification was 96%. Results of HER2 assessment in biopsy and resection specimens were concordant in 92. 9% (145/156). HER2 positive rate (IHC3+, or IHC2+/BDISH positive) was 10.
Non-randomized controlled trial	9% in the whole cohort and 10. 4% in resection specimens. A further 4. 0% of resections were IHC negative/BDISH positive.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER2 status was neither prognostic, nor (in pre-treatment biopsies) predicted enhanced benefit from chemotherapy [HER2 positive HR 0. 74 (0. 14-3. 77); HER2 negative HR 0. 58 (0. 41-0. 82), interaction P = 0. 7].
Non-randomized controlled trial	However, the power of the predictive analysis was limited by the small number of HER2 positive pre-treatment biopsies. Conclusions: HER2 status is not an independent prognostic biomarker in early oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma.

Non-randomized controlled trial	With the availability of a therapeutic target and an effective agent in trastuzumab, a systematic examination of the literature to investigate the role of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) as a prognostic factor for survival and its association with clinicopathologic markers may improve treatment.
Non-randomized controlled trial	An electronic search of the MEDLINE and PubMed databases (January 1990 to January 2011) was undertaken to identify translational studies that correlated HER2 with clinicopathologic markers and/or survival outcome.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This review included 49 studies totaling 11,337 patients. Forty-four percent of patients had Stage I/II, and 56% had Stage III/IV disease.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Immunohistochemistry was most commonly used to assess HER2 expression, identifying a median rate of 18% (range, 4-53%) of gastric cancer demonstrating HER2 overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	In patients with and without HER2 overexpression, the median 3-year disease-free survival rate was 58% (range, 50-88%) and 86% (range, 62-97%), respectively.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Of the 35 studies reporting the impact of HER2 overexpression on survival, 20 studies (57%) reported no difference in overall survival, two studies (6%) reported significantly longer overall survival in patients with HER2 overexpression and 13 studies (37%) reported significantly poorer overall survival in patients with HER2 overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The median overall survival and 5-year survival rate was 21 (range, 10-57) months and 42%, and 33 (range, 13-80) months and 52% in patients with and without HER2 overexpression, respectively.

Non-randomized controlled trial	Clinicopathologic factors associated with HER2-positive gastric cancer and its impact on survival outcomes--a systematic review
Non-randomized controlled trial	The HER-2/neu oncogene is localized to chromosome 17q and shares significant homology with the epidermal growth factor receptor.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2/neu protein overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis in a variety of tumors, but its significance in Barrett's esophagus-associated adenocarcinoma (BEAd) is unknown.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 63 cases of BEAd.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Routinely processed tissue sections from resection specimens of 63 patients with BEAd (M/F ratio, 10:1; mean age, 63 years) were assayed for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH using the Ventana unique sequence probe (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc, Tuscon, AZ).
Non-randomized controlled trial	FISH results were correlated with the pathological features of the tumors and with patient survival. Clinical follow-up data were available for 54 patients (mean follow-up, 31 months [range, 1 to 152 months]).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The HER-2/ neu gene was amplified in 12 of 63 (19%) cases. The presence of HER-2/neu gene amplification showed a trend toward a correlation with depth of tumor invasion (P =. 07), lymph node metastasis (P =. 13), and pathological stage (P =.
Non-randomized controlled trial	14), but did not correlate with any of the other pathological features, such as degree of differentiation or tumor size. On both univariate and multivariate analysis, HER-2/neu gene amplification was associated with shortened survival (P =. 03).
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2/neu oncogene amplification, as determined by FISH, correlates with shortened patient survival and independently predicts poor outcome in patients with BEAd.
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH predicts poor survival in Barrett's esophagus-associated adenocarcinoma
Non-randomized controlled trial	Background: HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2, HER2) gene amplification and protein overexpression have been associated with poor prognosis in several solid tumors, including breast and gastric cancer.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Its incidence and significance in esophageal adenocarcinoma is unknown.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Materials and methods: Tissue microarrays were successfully constructed from 89 paraffin-embedded archival specimens of esophageal adenocarcinomas for HER2 gene amplification by silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH).
Non-randomized controlled trial	No patients had undergone neoadjuvant therapy. Protein overexpression was tested with immunohistochemistry (IHC) using automated immunostaining (Ventana Benchmark).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Incidence of HER2 positivity, correlation to clinicopathological variables in esophageal cancer patients, and concordance between SISH and IHC were determined.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Results: True HER2 gene amplification was detected in 14 esophageal cancer specimens (16%), and 92% of those with high-level HER2 amplification showed positive HER2 protein overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	No significant associations were found among gene amplification and clinicopathological factors.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The 5-year survival rates were 57% for esophageal cancer patients with HER2 amplification compared with 32% without, but the difference in overall survival was not significant (P =. 37).
Non-randomized controlled trial	The correlation between SISH and IHC was statistically significant (P <. 0001).
Non-randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: While molecular targeting may be possible for approximately 16% of esophageal adenocarcinoma patients, HER2 oncogene amplification did not influence survival in this study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Her-2/neu gene amplification in esophageal adenocarcinoma and its influence on survival
Non-randomized controlled trial	HER-2 is the target for antibody based treatment of breast cancer (Herceptin).
Non-randomized controlled trial	In order to evaluate the potential role of such a treatment in esophageal cancers, HER-2 amplification and overexpression was investigated in primary and metastatic cancers of the esophagus.
Non-randomized controlled trial	A tissue microarray was constructed from 255 primary esophageal cancers (110 adenocarcinomas and 145 squamous cell carcinomas), 89 nodal and 33 distant metastases.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Slides were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest; DAKO) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; PathVysion; Vysis-Abbott) for HER-2 amplification and overexpression.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Amplification was seen in 16/110 (15%) adenocarcinomas and in 7/145 (5%) squamous cell carcinomas. There was a strong association between HER-2 amplification and overexpression, especially in adenocarcinomas (P<0. 0001, log rank).
Non-randomized controlled trial	There was a 100% concordance of the HER-2 results in primary tumor and corresponding metastases in 84 analyzed pairs. Amplification was typically high-level with more than 10-15 HER-2 copies per tumor cell.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Amplification was unrelated to survival, grading, pT, pN, pM or UICC stage.
Non-randomized controlled trial	We conclude that esophageal adenocarcinomas belong to those cancer types with relevant frequency high-level HER-2 gene amplification clinical trials or individual case studies investigating the response of metastatic HER-2-positive esophageal cancers to Herceptin((R)) should be undertaken.
Non-randomized controlled trial	The strong concordance of the HER-2 status in primary and metastatic cancers argues for a possible response of metastases from patients with HER-2-positive primary tumors to Herceptin.

randomized controlled trial	Background: To develop and validate a nomogram and web-based calculator to predict overall survival (OS) in Caucasian-advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (AOA) patients undergoing first-line combination chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Nine hundred twenty-four AOA patients treated at 28 Spanish teaching hospitals from January 2008 to September 2014 were used as derivation cohort.
randomized controlled trial	The result of an adjusted-Cox proportional hazards regression was represented as a nomogram and web-based calculator. The model was validated in 502 prospectively recruited patients treated between October 2014 and December 2016.
randomized controlled trial	Harrell's c-index was used to evaluate discrimination.
randomized controlled trial	Results: The nomogram includes seven predictors associated with OS: HER2-positive tumours treated with trastuzumab, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, number of metastatic sites, bone metastases, ascites, histological grade, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.
randomized controlled trial	Median OS was 5. 8 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4. 5-6. 6), 9. 4 (95% CI, 8. 5-10. 6), and 14 months (95% CI, 11. 8-16) for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups, respectively (P<0. 001), in the derivation set and 4. 6 (95% CI, 3. 3-8. 1), 12.
randomized controlled trial	7 (95% CI, 11. 3-14. 3), and 18. 3 months (95% CI, 14. 6-24. 2) for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups, respectively (P<0. 001), in the validation set.
randomized controlled trial	The nomogram is well-calibrated and reveals acceptable discriminatory capacity, with optimism-corrected c-indices of 0. 618 (95% CI, 0. 591-0. 631) and 0. 673 (95% CI, 0. 636-0. 709) in derivation and validation groups, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	The AGAMENON nomogram outperformed the Royal Marsden Hospital (c-index=0. 583; P=0. 00046) and Japan Clinical Oncology Group prognostic indices (c-index=0. 611; P=0. 03351).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: We developed and validated a straightforward model to predict survival in Caucasian AOA patients initiating first-line polychemotherapy. This model can contribute to inform clinical decision-making and optimise clinical trial design.

randomized controlled trial	Background: The best chemotherapy regimen for metastatic gastric cancer is uncertain, but promising findings have been reported with irinotecan plus cisplatin and S-1 (tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydropyrimidine, and potassium oxonate).
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to investigate the superiority of irinotecan plus cisplatin and non-inferiority of S-1 compared with fluorouracil, with respect to overall survival, in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We undertook a phase 3 open label randomised trial in 34 institutions in Japan.
randomized controlled trial	We enrolled patients aged 20-75 years or younger, who had histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma, and randomly assigned them by minimisation to receive either: a continuous infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2) per day, on days 1-5) every 4 weeks (n=234); intravenous irinotecan (70 mg/m(2), on days 1 and 15) and cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), on day 1) every 4 weeks (n=236); or oral S-1 (40 mg/m(2), twice a day, on days 1-28) every 6 weeks (n=234).
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials. gov, number NCT00142350, and with UMIN-CTR, number C000000062.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: All randomised patients were included in the primary analysis. Median overall survival was 10. 8 months (IQR 5. 7-17. 8) for individuals assigned fluorouracil, 12. 3 months (8. 1-19.
randomized controlled trial	5) for those allocated irinotecan plus cisplatin (hazard ratio 0. 85 [95% CI 0. 70-1. 04]; p=0. 0552), and 11. 4 months (6. 4-21. 3) for those assigned S-1 (0. 83 [0. 68-1. 01]; p=0. 0005 for non-inferiority).
randomized controlled trial	Three treatment-related deaths occurred in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group and one was recorded in the S-1 group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: S-1 is non-inferior to fluorouracil and, in view of the convenience of an oral administration, could replace intravenous fluorouracil for treatment of unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer, at least in Asia.
randomized controlled trial	Irinotecan plus cisplatin is not superior to fluorouracil in this setting.

randomized controlled trial	Elderly (>or=65 years) chemo-naive patients with AGC were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine 1250 mg m(-2) two times daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks or S-1 40-60 mg two times daily according to body surface area on days 1-28 every 6 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	Ninety-six patients were enrolled and 91 patients were randomised to capecitabine (N=46) or S-1 (N=45). Overall response rate, the primary end point, was 27. 2% (95% CI, 14. 1-40. 4, 12 of 44 assessable patients) with capecitabine and 28.
randomized controlled trial	9% (95% CI, 15. 6-42. 1, 13 of 45) with S-1. Median times to progression and overall survival in the capecitabine arm (4. 7 and 9. 5 months, respectively) were similar to those in the S-1 arm (4. 2 and 8. 2 months, respectively).
randomized controlled trial	The incidence of grade 3-4 granulocytopenia was 6. 8% with capecitabine and 4. 8% with S-1. Grade 3-4 nonhaematologic toxicities were: asthenia (9. 1% with capecitabine vs 7. 1% with S-1), anorexia (6. 8 vs 9. 5%), diarrhoea (2.
randomized controlled trial	3 vs 0%), and hand-foot syndrome (6. 8 vs 0%). Both capecitabine and S-1 monotherapies were active and tolerable as first-line treatment for elderly patients with AGC.
randomized controlled trial	A randomised multicentre phase II trial of capecitabine vs S-1 as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic or recurrent unresectable gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Phase I/II clinical trials of S-1 plus cisplatin for advanced gastric cancer have yielded good responses and the treatment was well tolerated.
randomized controlled trial	In this S-1 Plus cisplatin versus S-1 In RCT In the Treatment for Stomach cancer (SPIRITS) trial, we aimed to verify that overall survival was better in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with S-1 plus cisplatin than with S-1 alone.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this phase III trial, chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled between March 26, 2002, and Nov 30, 2004, at 38 centres in Japan, and randomly assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin or S-1 alone.
randomized controlled trial	In patients assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin, S-1 (40-60 mg depending on patient's body surface area) was given orally, twice daily for 3 consecutive weeks, and 60 mg/m(2) cisplatin was given intravenously on day 8, followed by a 2-week rest period, within a 5-week cycle.
randomized controlled trial	Those assigned to S-1 alone received the same dose of S-1 twice daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, within a 6-week cycle. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, proportions of responders, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00150670.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: 305 patients were enrolled; seven patients were ineligible or withdrew consent, therefore, 148 patients were assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin and 150 patients were assigned to S-1 alone.
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin (13. 0 months [IQR 7. 6-21. 9]) than in those assigned to S-1 alone (11. 0 months [5. 6-19. 8]; hazard ratio for death, 0. 77; 95% CI 0. 61-0. 98; p=0. 04).
randomized controlled trial	Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin than in those assigned to S-1 alone (median progression-free survival 6. 0 months [3. 3-12. 9] vs 4. 0 months [2. 1-6. 8]; p<0. 0001).
randomized controlled trial	Additionally, of 87 patients assigned S-1 plus cisplatin who had target tumours, one patient had a complete response and 46 patients had partial responses, ie, a total of 54% (range 43-65).
randomized controlled trial	Of 106 patients assigned S-1 alone who had target tumours, one patient had a complete response and 32 had partial responses, ie, a total of 31% (23-41).
randomized controlled trial	We recorded more grade 3 or 4 adverse events including leucopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, nausea, and anorexia, in the group assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin than in the group assigned to S-1 alone. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: S-1 plus cisplatin holds promise of becoming a standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	S-1 plus cisplatin versus S-1 alone for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (SPIRITS trial): a phase III trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil has been globally accepted as a standard regimen for the treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, cisplatin has several disadvantages, including renal toxicity and the need for admission.
randomized controlled trial	S-1 plus cisplatin has become a standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer in East Asia.
randomized controlled trial	This phase III study was designed to evaluate the potential benefits of adding docetaxel to S-1 without a platinum compound in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel plus S-1 or S-1 alone.
randomized controlled trial	The docetaxel plus S-1 group received docetaxel on day 1 and oral S-1 on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle. The S-1 alone group received oral S-1 on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle. The primary end point was overall survival.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of the 639 patients enrolled, 635 were eligible for analysis. The median overall survival was 12. 5 months in the docetaxel plus S-1 group and 10. 8 months in the S-1 alone group (p = 0. 032). The median progression-free survival was 5.
randomized controlled trial	3 months in the docetaxel plus S-1 group and 4. 2 months in the S-1 alone group (p = 0. 001). As for adverse events, neutropenia was more frequent in the docetaxel plus S-1 group, but remained manageable.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: As first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer, docetaxel plus S-1 significantly improves median overall and progression-free survival as compared with S-1 alone. (ClinicalTrials. gov number: NCT00287768).
randomized controlled trial	Addition of docetaxel to S-1 without platinum prolongs survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer: a randomized study (START)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This study was designed to compare fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction were randomly assigned to receive either fluorouracil 2,600 mg/m(2) via 24-hour infusion, leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) (FLO) every 2 weeks or fluorouracil 2,000 mg/m(2) via 24-hour infusion, leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) weekly, and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks (FLP).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Two hundred twenty patients (median age, 64 years; metastatic, 94%) were randomly assigned.
randomized controlled trial	FLO was associated with significantly less (any grade) anemia (54% v 72%), nausea (53% v 70%), vomiting (31% v 52%), alopecia (22% v 39%), fatigue (19% v 34%), renal toxicity (11% v 34%), thromboembolic events (0. 9% v 7.
randomized controlled trial	8%), and serious adverse events related to the treatment (9% v 19%). FLP was associated with significantly less peripheral neuropathy (22% v 63%). There was a trend toward improved median PFS with FLO versus FLP (5. 8 v 3. 9 months, respectively; P =.
randomized controlled trial	077) and no significant difference in median overall survival (10. 7 v 8. 8 months, respectively). However, in patients older than 65 years (n = 94), treatment with FLO resulted in significantly superior response rates (41. 3% v 16. 7%; P =.
randomized controlled trial	012), time to treatment failure (5. 4 v 2. 3 months; P <. 001), and PFS (6. 0 v 3. 1 month; P =. 029) and an improved OS (13. 9 v 7. 2 months) as compared with FLP, respectively. Conclusion: FLO reduced toxicity as compared with FLP.
randomized controlled trial	In older adult patients, FLO also seemed to be associated with improved efficacy.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III trial in metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with fluorouracil, leucovorin plus either oxaliplatin or cisplatin: a study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: S-1 or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin are considered active and tolerable in gastric cancer patients. We conducted a randomized phase II trial in gastric cancer patients to compare the activity and safety of these combinations.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: The patients received S-1 at 80 mg/m2 for 14 days, followed by a 7-day rest period within a 3-week schedule in the S-1/oxaliplatin (SOX) arm, and capecitabine at 2000 mg/m2 for 14 days, followed by a 7-day rest period within a 3-week schedule in the capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) arm.
randomized controlled trial	Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 was administered every 3 weeks in both arms. Results: One hundred twenty-nine patients were randomly assigned to SOX (N=65) or CAPOX (N=64). The median time to progression and the overall survival were 6. 2 and 12.
randomized controlled trial	4 months with SOX, respectively; and 7. 2 and 13. 3 months with CAPOX, respectively. The overall response rates were 40% and 44% for SOX and CAPOX, respectively. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (15.
randomized controlled trial	4%) for SOX and neutropenia (18. 8%) for CAPOX. The median time to 10% deteriorations in global health scores was similar in both arms (SOX, 4. 3 months, CAPOX, 4. 9 months).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Both the SOX and CAPOX regimens were equally active and well tolerated in advanced gastric cancer patients.
randomized controlled trial	A randomized phase II trial of S-1-oxaliplatin versus capecitabine-oxaliplatin in advanced gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Docetaxel/cisplatin/infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; DCF) is a standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC).
randomized controlled trial	This phase II study evaluated docetaxel/oxaliplatin (TE), docetaxel/oxaliplatin/5-FU (TEF), and docetaxel/oxaliplatin/capecitabine (TEX) in patients with advanced GC.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma (including carcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction) were randomly assigned (1 : 1 : 1) to TE, TEF, or TEX.
randomized controlled trial	Each regimen was tested at two doses before full evaluation at optimized dose levels. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS), tumour response, and safety were also assessed.
randomized controlled trial	A therapeutic index (median PFS relative to the incidence of febrile neutropenia) was calculated for each regimen and compared with DCF (historical data). Results: Overall, 248 patients were randomly assigned to receive optimized dose treatment.
randomized controlled trial	Median PFS was longer with TEF (7. 66 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6. 97-9. 40] months) versus TE (4. 50 [3. 68-5. 32] months) and TEX (5. 55 [4. 30-6. 37] months). Median OS was 14. 59 (95% CI: 11. 70-21. 78) months for TEF versus 8. 97 (7. 79-10.
randomized controlled trial	87) months for TE and 11. 30 (8. 08-14. 03) months for TEX. The rate of tumour response (complete or partial) was 46. 6% (95% CI 35. 9-57. 5) for TEF versus 23. 1% (14. 3-34. 0) for TE and 25. 6% (16. 6-36. 4) for TEX.
randomized controlled trial	The frequency and type of adverse events (AEs) were similar across the three arms. Common grade 3/4 AEs were fatigue (21%), sensory neuropathy (14%), and diarrhoea (13%).
randomized controlled trial	Febrile neutropenia was reported in 2% (TEF), 14% (TE), and 9% (TEX) of patients. The therapeutic index was improved with TEF versus TEX, TE, or DCF.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: These results suggest that TEF is worthy of evaluation as an arm in a phase III trial or as a backbone regimen for new targeted agents in advanced GC. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV: Identifier Trial registration number: NCT00382720.
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel plus oxaliplatin with or without fluorouracil or capecitabine in metastatic or locally recurrent gastric cancer: a randomized phase II study
randomized controlled trial	Background: We evaluated the feasibility and tolerability of triple- versus double-drug chemotherapy in elderly patients with oesophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients aged 65 years or older with locally advanced or metastatic oesophagogastric cancer were stratified and randomised to infusional 5-FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin without (FLO) or with docetaxel 50 mg/m(2) (FLOT) every 2 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The study is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, identifier NCT00737373. Findings: One hundred and forty three (FLO, 71; FLOT, 72) patients with a median age of 70 years were enrolled.
randomized controlled trial	The triple combination was associated with more treatment-related National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 3/4 adverse events (FLOT, 81. 9%; FLO, 38. 6%; P<.
randomized controlled trial	001) and more patients experiencing a ≥10-points deterioration of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QoL) global health status scores (FLOT, 47. 5%; FLO 20. 5%; p=. 011).
randomized controlled trial	The triple combination was associated with more alopecia (P<. 001), neutropenia (P<. 001), leukopenia (P<. 001), diarrhoea (P=. 006) and nausea (P=. 029). ).
randomized controlled trial	No differences were observed in treatment duration and discontinuation due to toxicity, cumulative doses or toxic deaths between arms.
randomized controlled trial	The triple combination improved response rates and progression-free survival in the locally advanced subgroup and in the subgroup of patients aged between 65 and 70 years but not in the metastatic group or in patients aged 70 years and older.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: The triple-drug chemotherapy was feasible in elderly patients with oesophagogastric cancer. However, toxicity was significantly increased and QoL deteriorated in a relevant proportion of patients.
randomized controlled trial	Funding: The study was partially funded by Sanofi-Aventis.
randomized controlled trial	The feasibility of triple-drug chemotherapy combination in older adult patients with oesophagogastric cancer: a randomised trial of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (FLOT65+)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To determine the optimal chemotherapy backbone for testing in future US cooperative group studies for metastatic esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers. Cetuximab was added to each treatment arm based on promising preclinical data.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with previously untreated metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer were randomly assigned at a one-to-one-to-one ratio to epirubicin, cisplatin, and continuous-infusion fluorouracil (ECF), irinotecan plus cisplatin (IC), or FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and bolus and infusional fluorouracil).
randomized controlled trial	All treatment programs included cetuximab once per week. The primary end point was response rate. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and safety.
randomized controlled trial	As prespecified, primary and secondary analyses were conducted only among patients with adenocarcinoma. Results: This study randomly assigned 245 patients, including 222 with adenocarcinoma. Among patients with adenocarcinoma, response rate was 60.
randomized controlled trial	9% (95% CI, 47. 9 to 72. 8) for ECF plus cetuximab, 45. 0% (95% CI, 33. 0 to 57. 0) for IC plus cetuximab, and 54. 3% (95% CI, 42. 0 to 66. 2) for FOLFOX plus cetuximab. Median overall survival was 11. 6, 8. 6, and 11.
randomized controlled trial	8 months; median progression-free survival was 7. 1, 4. 9, and 6. 8 months; and median time to treatment failure was 5. 6, 4. 3, and 6. 7 months for each of these arms, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	FOLFOX plus cetuximab required fewer treatment modifications compared with ECF plus cetuximab and IC plus cetuximab (P =. 013), and fewer patients were removed from treatment because of an adverse event or experienced treatment-related death.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: In combination with cetuximab, ECF and FOLFOX had similar efficacy, but FOLFOX was better tolerated. Although differences were nonsignificant, IC plus cetuximab seemed to be the least effective and most toxic of the three regimens tested.
randomized controlled trial	CALGB 80403 (Alliance)/E1206: A Randomized Phase II Study of Three Chemotherapy Regimens Plus Cetuximab in Metastatic Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancers
randomized controlled trial	Background: We evaluated capecitabine (an oral fluoropyrimidine) and oxaliplatin (a platinum compound) as alternatives to infused fluorouracil and cisplatin, respectively, for untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In a two-by-two design, we randomly assigned 1002 patients to receive triplet therapy with epirubicin and cisplatin plus either fluorouracil (ECF) or capecitabine (ECX) or triplet therapy with epirubicin and oxaliplatin plus either fluorouracil (EOF) or capecitabine (EOX).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was noninferiority in overall survival for the triplet therapies containing capecitabine as compared with fluorouracil and for those containing oxaliplatin as compared with cisplatin.
randomized controlled trial	Results: For the capecitabine-fluorouracil comparison, the hazard ratio for death in the capecitabine group was 0. 86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 80 to 0.
randomized controlled trial	99); for the oxaliplatin-cisplatin comparison, the hazard ratio for the oxaliplatin group was 0. 92 (95% CI, 0. 80 to 1. 10). The upper limit of the confidence intervals for both hazard ratios excluded the predefined noninferiority margin of 1. 23.
randomized controlled trial	Median survival times in the ECF, ECX, EOF, and EOX groups were 9. 9 months, 9. 9 months, 9. 3 months, and 11. 2 months, respectively; survival rates at 1 year were 37. 7%, 40. 8%, 40. 4%, and 46. 8%, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	In the secondary analysis, overall survival was longer with EOX than with ECF, with a hazard ratio for death of 0. 80 in the EOX group (95% CI, 0. 66 to 0. 97; P=0. 02).
randomized controlled trial	Progression-free survival and response rates did not differ significantly among the regimens. Toxic effects of capecitabine and fluorouracil were similar.
randomized controlled trial	As compared with cisplatin, oxaliplatin was associated with lower incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, alopecia, renal toxicity, and thromboembolism but with slightly higher incidences of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and neuropathy.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Capecitabine and oxaliplatin are as effective as fluorouracil and cisplatin, respectively, in patients with previously untreated esophagogastric cancer. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN51678883 [controlled-trials. com]. ).
randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine and oxaliplatin for advanced esophagogastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) as an alternative to cisplatin plus S-1 (CS) in first-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In this randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study, patients were randomly assigned to receive SOX (80-120 mg/day S-1 for 2 weeks with 100 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin on day 1, every 3 weeks) or CS (S-1 for 3 weeks with 60 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 8, every 5 weeks).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end points were noninferiority in progression-free survival (PFS) and relative efficacy in overall survival (OS) for SOX using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with stratification factors; performance status and unresectable or recurrent (+adjuvant chemotherapy) disease.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Overall, 685 patients were randomized from January 2010 to October 2011. In per-protocol population, SOX (n = 318) was noninferior to CS (n = 324) in PFS [median, 5. 5 versus 5. 4 months; HR 1. 004, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 840-1.
randomized controlled trial	199; predefined noninferiority margin 1. 30]. The median OS for SOX and CS were 14. 1 and 13. 1 months, respectively (HR 0. 958 with 95% CI 0. 803-1. 142). In the intention-to-treat population (SOX, n = 339; CS, n = 337), the HRs in PFS and OS were 0.
randomized controlled trial	979 (95% CI 0. 821-1. 167) and 0. 934 (95% CI 0. 786-1. 108), respectively. The most common ≥grade 3 adverse events (SOX versus CS) were neutropenia (19. 5% versus 41. 8%), anemia (15. 1% versus 32. 5%), hyponatremia (4. 4% versus 13.
randomized controlled trial	4%), febrile neutropenia (0. 9% versus 6. 9%), and sensory neuropathy (4. 7% versus 0%). Conclusion: SOX is as effective as CS for AGC with favorable safety profile, therefore SOX can replace CS. Clinical trial number: JapicCTI-101021.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III study comparing oxaliplatin plus S-1 with cisplatin plus S-1 in chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: S-1 plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin showed promising efficacy for treatment of advanced gastric cancer in a randomised phase 2 study.
randomized controlled trial	We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral TAS-118 (S-1 plus leucovorin) and oxaliplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in 62 centres across Japan and South Korea.
randomized controlled trial	Patients aged 20 years or older, with a histologically confirmed advanced gastric cancer with negative or unknown HER2 status, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable or evaluable metastatic lesions, and no previous treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system using the minimisation method, stratified by performance status, presence of a measurable lesion, and country, to receive TAS-118 (S-1 40-60 mg and leucovorin 25 mg orally twice daily for 7 days) plus oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1) every 2 weeks, or S-1 (40-60 mg orally twice daily) for 21 days plus cisplatin (60 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 or 8) every 5 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival in patients who had advanced gastric cancer with measurable or evaluable metastatic lesions and who received the study drug. Safety was assessed in all patients who received the study drug.
randomized controlled trial	This study was registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT02322593. Findings: Between Jan 28, 2015, and Dec 5, 2016, 711 patients were randomised to TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin (n=356) or S-1 plus cisplatin (n=355).
randomized controlled trial	11 untreated patients and 19 ineligible patients were excluded from the primary analysis (TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group n=347, S-1 plus cisplatin group n=334) following recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee.
randomized controlled trial	After median follow-up of 26·0 months (IQR 22·0-32·8), median overall survival was 16·0 months (95% CI 13·8-18·3) in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and 15·1 months (95% CI 13·6-16·4) in the S-1 plus cisplatin group (hazard ratio 0·83, 95% CI 0·69-0·99; p=0·039).
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the 352 patients in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and the 348 patients in the S-1 plus cisplatin group were anaemia (56 [16%] vs 64 [18%]), neutropenia (54 [15%] vs 88 [25%]), decreased appetite (53 [15%] vs 46 [13%]), diarrhoea (33 [9%] vs 15 [4%]), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (30 [9%] vs one [<1%]).
randomized controlled trial	Serious adverse events were observed in 155 (44%) of 352 patients in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and 159 (46%) of 348 patients in the S-1 plus cisplatin group.
randomized controlled trial	Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group (pulmonary tuberculosis and viral pneumonia).
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin showed a clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy compared with S-1 plus cisplatin, and could be considered a new first-line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer in Asian patients.

randomized controlled trial	S-1 plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (SOLAR): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial
meta analysis	Background: Cisplatin has been largely used in the treatment of advanced, unresectable gastric cancer, mainly in combinations with fluoropyrimidines and anthracyclines.
meta analysis	Oxaliplatin has been shown to be at least as effective as cisplatin for this disease, but with less toxicity and a better tolerability profile, especially for older patients.
meta analysis	We performed a systematic review of the literature to address and quantify differences in the efficacy and the safety between oxaliplatin and cisplatin for the treatment of this disease.
meta analysis	Methods: The literature was searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oxaliplatin to cisplatin. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze dichotomous variables.
meta analysis	Hazard ratios (HRs) for progression and death were combined with an inverse variance method based on logarithmic conversion. A fixed effect model and Mantel-Haenszel's (M-H) method were used.
meta analysis	Heterogeneity was tested with the Q test and the I (2) value. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Three RCTs were identified, involving a total of 1294 patients. Oxaliplatin significantly improved progression-free survival (HR = 0.
meta analysis	88, p = 0. 02) and overall survival (HR = 0. 88, p = 0. 04). Moreover, it was associated with less neutropenia (OR = 0. 53, p < 0. 01) and fewer thromboembolic events (OR = 0. 42, p < 0.
meta analysis	01), but it was also associated with increased neurotoxicity (OR = 6. 91, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Our results support the existence of a small but significant survival benefit of oxaliplatin over cisplatin.
meta analysis	Oxaliplatin is associated with less toxicity and better tolerability, especially in older patients and when used in two-drug, bi-weekly regimens.
meta analysis	Effectiveness and safety of oxaliplatin compared to cisplatin for advanced, unresectable gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
randomized controlled trial	Patients with measurable or evaluable locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus were treated with cisplatin (CDDP), 100 mg/m2, combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion from days 1-5 (Arm A) or with CDDP alone (Arm B).
randomized controlled trial	Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. 92 patients were randomised centrally, 88 were eligible. The response rate was 35% (95% CI (confidence interval), 20-54%) in Arm A and 19% (95% CI, 8-35%) in Arm B. One complete response was observed in each arm.
randomized controlled trial	The median duration of survival was 33 weeks and 28 weeks for Arm A and Arm B, respectively. Haematological and non-haematological toxicities were more frequent and more severe in Arm A.
randomized controlled trial	The most prominent toxicities were grade 4 aplasia and septicaemia (2), meningeal haemorrhage (1), cerebrovascular accident (3) and ischaemia of the lower limbs (1) all occurring in Arm A.
randomized controlled trial	Overall, seven treatment-related deaths (16%) were observed in Arm A, none in Arm B.
randomized controlled trial	The severe side-effects induced by the combination suggest that, currently, no standard chemotherapy can be recommended for patients with advanced squamous cell oesophageal cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Randomised phase II study of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus cisplatin alone in advanced squamous cell oesophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: To compare capecitabine/cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Patients and methods: In this randomised, open-label, phase III study, patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2) i.

randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was to confirm noninferiority of XP versus FP for progression-free survival (PFS). Results: A total of 316 patients were randomised to XP (n = 160) or FP (n = 156).
randomized controlled trial	In the per-protocol population, median PFS for XP (n = 139) versus FP (n = 137) was 5. 6 versus 5. 0 months. The primary end point was met with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 63-1. 04, P < 0.
randomized controlled trial	001 versus noninferiority margin of 1. 25]. Median overall survival was 10. 5 versus 9. 3 months for XP versus FP (unadjusted HR = 0. 85, 95% CI 0. 64-1. 13, P = 0. 008 versus noninferiority margin of 1. 25).
randomized controlled trial	The most common treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events in XP versus FP patients were as follows: neutropenia (16% versus 19%), vomiting (7% versus 8%), and stomatitis (2% versus 6%).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: XP showed significant noninferiority for PFS versus FP in the first-line treatment of AGC. XP can be considered an effective alternative to FP.
randomized controlled trial	Capecitabine/cisplatin versus 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer: a randomised phase III noninferiority trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: The REAL-2 and ML17032 trials demonstrated that the oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, is noninferior to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively, in advanced oesophago-gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Individual patient data were collected on all patients randomised within the trials (n = 1318).
randomized controlled trial	Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and the log-rank test was used to compare OS and PFS between patients receiving 5-FU combinations and capecitabine combinations.
randomized controlled trial	Stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to calculate corrected hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS and PFS. Logistic regression was used for objective response rate.
randomized controlled trial	Forest plots with tests of heterogeneity were generated. Results: OS was superior in the 654 patients treated with capecitabine combinations compared with the 664 patients treated with 5-FU combinations; HR 0. 87 (95% CI 0. 77-0. 98, P = 0. 02).
randomized controlled trial	Poor performance status, age <60 and metastatic disease were independent predictors of poor survival. There was no significant difference in PFS between treatment groups on multivariate analysis.
randomized controlled trial	Assessable patients treated with capecitabine combinations were significantly more likely to have an objective response to treatment than those treated with 5-FU combinations; odds ratio 1. 38 (95% CI 1. 10-1. 73, P = 0. 006).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: OS is superior in patients treated with capecitabine combinations compared with 5-FU combinations in advanced oesophago-gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Meta-analysis of the REAL-2 and ML17032 trials: evaluating capecitabine-based combination chemotherapy and infused 5-fluorouracil-based combination chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced oesophago-gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Background: Capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) is a standard global regimen, while S-1 plus cisplatin (SP) is a Japanese standard for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
randomized controlled trial	We conducted a phase II trial comparing XP with SP for patients with AGC to confirm whether these regimens can be used as controls in a phase III study and to explore whether histological subtypes favour XP or SP.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligible patients were randomised to receive either S-1 40 mg/m2 for 21 days plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2 (q5w) or capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 for 14 days plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 (q3w).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end-points were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Results: In 110 eligible patients, 24-week PFS was higher in both groups (SP 50. 9%, XP 43.
randomized controlled trial	5%) than the protocol-specified threshold of 40%. The median PFS for SP versus XP was 5. 6 and 5. 1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 126; p = 0. 5626); OS was 13. 5 and 12. 6 months (HR, 0. 942; p = 0. 7769) and the ORR was 42. 4% and 69. 4% (p = 0.
randomized controlled trial	0237), respectively. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events with SP/XP were anaemia (16%/20%), neutropenia (9%/18%) and anorexia (18%/13%). Subgroup analysis by histological classification showed no statistical difference between treatments.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: XP and SP are comparable and can be recommended as control arms in a phase III study for AGC. Histological subtypes were not sensitive markers for the selection of XP or SP. Clinical trial registration: NCT00140624.
randomized controlled trial	A randomised phase II trial of capecitabine plus cisplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin as a first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer: Capecitabine plus cisplatin ascertainment versus S-1 plus cisplatin randomised PII trial (XParTS II)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma need more efficacious and safer treatments than established today. S-1, a contemporary oral fluoropyrimidine, can provide that advantage.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: This study was conducted in 24 countries and 146 centers. One thousand fifty-three patients were stratified (center, number of metastatic sites, prior adjuvant therapy, and measurable cancer) and randomly assigned.
randomized controlled trial	Patients received either S-1 at 50 mg/m(2) divided in two daily doses for 21 days and cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, repeated every 28 days (527 patients) or infusional fluorouracil at 1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 120 hours and cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, repeated every 28 days (526 patients).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was superiority in overall survival (OS) from cisplatin/S-1 compared with cisplatin/infusional fluorouracil in patients with advanced, untreated gastric, or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	The secondary end points were response rate, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and safety. Results: The median OS was 8. 6 months in the cisplatin/S-1 arm and 7. 9 months in the cisplatin/infusional fluorouracil arm (HR, 0.
randomized controlled trial	92; 95% CI, 0. 80 to 1. 05; P =. 20). Significant safety advantages were observed in the cisplatin/S-1 arm compared with the cisplatin/infusional fluorouracil arm for the rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia (32. 3% v 63. 6%), complicated neutropenia (5.
randomized controlled trial	0% v 14. 4%), stomatitis (1. 3% v 13. 6%), hypokalemia (3. 6% v 10. 8%), and treatment-related deaths (2. 5% v 4. 9%; P <. 05).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Cisplatin/S-1 did not prolong OS of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma compared with cisplatin/infusional fluorouracil, but it did result in a significantly improved safety profile.
randomized controlled trial	Multicenter phase III comparison of cisplatin/S-1 with cisplatin/infusional fluorouracil in advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma study: the FLAGS trial
randomized controlled trial	Background: The aim of developing oral fluorouracil (5-FU) is to provide a more convenient administration route with similar efficacy and the best achievable tolerance.
randomized controlled trial	S-1, a novel oral fluoropyrimidine, was specifically designed to overcome the limitations of intravenous fluoropyrimidine therapies.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: A multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial was undertaken to compare S-1/cisplatin (CS) with infusional 5-FU/cisplatin (CF) in 1053 patients with untreated, advanced gastric/gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	This report discusses a post-hoc noninferiority overall survival (OS) and safety analyses. Results: Results (1029 treated; CS = 521/CF = 508) revealed OS in CS (8. 6 months) was statistically noninferior to CF (7. 9 months) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.
randomized controlled trial	92 (two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), 0. 80-1. 05)] for any margin equal to or greater than 1. 05. Statistically significant safety advantages for the CS arm were observed [G3/4 neutropenia (CS, 18. 6%; CF, 40. 0%), febrile neutropenia (CS, 1.
randomized controlled trial	7%; CF, 6. 9%), G3/4 stomatitis (CS, 1. 3%; CF, 13. 6%), diarrhoea (all grades: CS, 29. 2%; CF, 38. 4%) and renal adverse events (all grades: CS, 18. 8%; CF, 33. 5%)]. Hand-foot syndrome, infrequently reported, was mainly grade 1/2 in both arms.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment-related deaths were significantly lower in the CS arm than the CF arm (2. 5% and 4. 9%, respectively; P<0. 047).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: CS is noninferior to CF with a better safety profile and provides a new treatment option for patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Combination of cisplatin/S-1 in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: Results of noninferiority and safety analyses compared with cisplatin/5-fluorouracil in the First-Line Advanced Gastric Cancer Study
randomized controlled trial	Background: The effect of histology-based treatment regimen on diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma has not been evaluated in clinical trials.
randomized controlled trial	This international phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of S-1 (a contemporary oral fluoropyrimidine)/cisplatin versus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin in chemotherapy-naïve patients with diffuse-type adenocarcinoma involving the gastroesophageal junction or stomach.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Eligibility criteria included untreated, measurable, advanced diffuse adenocarcinoma confirmed by central pathology and performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomized (2 : 1) to receive S-1/cisplatin or 5-FU/cisplatin.
randomized controlled trial	Primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, overall response rate, and safety. A multivariable analysis was also carried out.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Overall, 361 patients were randomized (S-1/cisplatin, n = 239; 5-FU/cisplatin, n = 122); half (51%) were men, and median age was 56. 0 years.
randomized controlled trial	In each group, median number of treatment cycles per patient was 4 (range, S-1/cisplatin: 1-20; 5-FU/cisplatin: 1-30), and dose intensity was >95%. OS was not different in the two groups {median OS with S-1/cisplatin, 7.
randomized controlled trial	5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6. 7, 9. 3]; 5-FU/cisplatin, 6. 6 [95% CI: 5. 7, 8. 1] months; hazard ratio, 0. 99 [95% CI: 0. 76, 1. 28]; P = 0. 9312}.
randomized controlled trial	Overall response rate was significantly higher in the S-1/cisplatin than 5-FU/cisplatin group (34. 7% versus 19. 8%; P = 0. 01), but progression-free survival and time to treatment failure were not different.
randomized controlled trial	Safety was similar between the 2 groups; however, fewer patients treated with S-1/cisplatin than 5-FU/cisplatin had ≥1 grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse event or ≥1 adverse event resulting in treatment discontinuation.
randomized controlled trial	One treatment-related death occurred in each group. Slow accrual led to early termination.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: These data suggest that S-1/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin are similar in efficacy and safety in untreated patients with advanced diffuse adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction or stomach. The primary end point was not met.
randomized controlled trial	Clinicaltrial. gov registration number: NCT01285557.
randomized controlled trial	A phase III trial comparing oral S-1/cisplatin and intravenous 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin in patients with untreated diffuse gastric cancer
meta analysis	Background: Gastric cancer currently ranks second in global cancer mortality. Most patients are either diagnosed at an advanced stage, or develop a relapse after surgery with curative intent.
meta analysis	Apart from supportive care and palliative radiation to localized (e. g. bone) metastasis, systemic chemotherapy is the only treatment option available in this situation.
meta analysis	Objectives: To assess the efficacy of chemotherapy versus best supportive care, combination versus single agent chemotherapy and different combination chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to March 2009, reference lists of studies, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and national and international experts.
meta analysis	Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials on systemic intravenous chemotherapy versus best supportive care, combination versus single agent chemotherapy and different combination chemotherapies in advanced gastric cancer.
meta analysis	Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. A third investigator was consulted in case of disagreements. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.
meta analysis	Main results: Thirty five trials, with a total of 5726 patients, have been included in the meta-analysis of overall survival.
meta analysis	The comparison of chemotherapy versus best supportive care consistently demonstrated a significant benefit in overall survival in favour of the group receiving chemotherapy (hazard ratios (HR) 0. 37; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0. 24 to 0.
meta analysis	55, 184 participants). The comparison of combination versus single-agent chemotherapy provides evidence for a survival benefit in favour of combination chemotherapy (HR 0. 82; 95% CI 0. 74 to 0. 90, 1914 participants).
meta analysis	The price of this benefit is increased toxicity as a result of combination chemotherapy. When comparing 5-FU/cisplatin-containing combination therapy regimens with versus without anthracyclines (HR 0. 77; 95% CI 0. 62 to 0.
meta analysis	95, 501 participants) and 5-FU/anthracycline-containing combinations with versus without cisplatin (HR 0. 82; 95% CI 0. 73 to 0. 92, 1147 participants) there was a significant survival benefit for regimens including 5-FU, anthracyclines and cisplatin.
meta analysis	Both the comparison of irinotecan versus non-irinotecan (HR 0. 86; 95% CI 0. 73 to 1. 02, 639 participants) and docetaxel versus non-docetaxel containing regimens (HR 0. 93; 95% CI 0. 75 to 1.
meta analysis	15, 805 participants) show non-significant overall survival benefits in favour of the irinotecan and docetaxel-containing regimens. Authors' conclusions: Chemotherapy significantly improves survival in comparison to best supportive care.
meta analysis	In addition, combination chemotherapy improves survival compared to single-agent 5-FU.
meta analysis	All patients should be tested for their HER-2 status and trastuzumab should be added to a standard fluoropyrimidine/cisplatin regimen in patients with HER-2 positive tumours.
meta analysis	Two and three-drug regimens including 5-FU, cisplatin, with or without an anthracycline, as well as irinotecan or docetaxel-containing regimens are reasonable treatment options for HER-2 negative patients.
meta analysis	Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To determine the efficacy and safety of a biweekly regimen of leucovorin (LV) plus fluorouracil (FU) alone or in combination with cisplatin or irinotecan in patients with previously untreated metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and to select the best arm for a phase III study.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: One hundred thirty-six patients (two were ineligible) were enrolled onto the randomized multicenter phase II trial.
randomized controlled trial	Patients received LV 200 mg/m(2) (2-hour infusion) followed by FU 400 mg/m(2) (bolus) and FU 600 mg/m(2) (22-hour continuous infusion) on days 1 and 2 every 14 days (LV5FU2; arm A), LV5FU2 plus cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) (1-hour infusion) on day 1 or 2 (arm B), or LV5FU2 plus irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) (2-hour infusion) on day 1 (arm C).
randomized controlled trial	Results: The overall response rates, which were confirmed by an independent expert panel, were 13% (95% CI, 3. 4% to 23. 3%), 27% (95% CI, 14. 1% to 40. 4%), and 40% (95% CI, 25. 7% to 54. 3%) for arms A, B, and C, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 3. 2 months (95% CI, 1. 8 to 4. 6 months) and 6. 8 months (95% CI, 2. 6 to 11. 1 months) with LV5FU2, respectively; 4. 9 months (95% CI, 3. 5 to 6. 3 months) and 9. 5 months (95% CI, 6.
randomized controlled trial	9 to 12. 2 months) with LV5FU2-cisplatin, respectively; and 6. 9 months (95% CI, 5. 5 to 8. 3 months) and 11. 3 months (95% CI, 9. 3 to 13. 3 months) with LV5FU2-irinotecan, respectively.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Of the three regimens tested, the combination of LV5FU2-irinotecan is the most promising and will be assessed in a phase III trial.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized multicenter phase II trial of a biweekly regimen of fluorouracil and leucovorin (LV5FU2), LV5FU2 plus cisplatin, or LV5FU2 plus irinotecan in patients with previously untreated metastatic gastric cancer: a Federation Francophone de Cancerologie Digestive Group Study--FFCD 9803
randomized controlled trial	Background: The combination of irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil demonstrates efficacy with tolerable safety in the first-line treatment of metastatic gastroesophageal cancer (mGC).
randomized controlled trial	This randomized phase II trial compared for the first time capecitabine with irinotecan or cisplatin in this setting.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3-week cycles of capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2), twice daily for 14 days, with on day 1 either irinotecan 250 mg/m(2) (XI) or cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) (XP).
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Of 118 patients recruited, 112 were eligible for safety analysis and 103 for efficacy analysis. In the XI and XP treatment arms, there were no marked differences in ORR, 37. 7% versus 42. 0%, and median PFS, 4. 2 versus 4.
randomized controlled trial	8 months, although median OS was longer, 10. 2 versus 7. 9 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicity was higher in the XP regimen for thrombocytes (18. 2% versus 1. 8%), nausea (23. 6% versus12. 3%) and vomiting (16. 4% versus 1.
randomized controlled trial	8%) and in the XI arm for diarrhea (22. 8% versus 7. 3%). Conclusion: The comparable activity and safety of the XI and XP regimens establish XI as a relevant platinum-free first-line treatment choice for patients with mGC.
randomized controlled trial	A randomized multicenter phase II study comparing capecitabine with irinotecan or cisplatin in metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagogastric junction
randomized controlled trial	Background: Irinotecan hydrochloride and S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, have shown antitumor activity against advanced gastric cancer as single agents in phase I/II studies.
randomized controlled trial	The combination of irinotecan and S-1 (IRI-S) is also active against advanced gastric cancer. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of IRI-S versus S-1 monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to oral S-1 (80 mg/m² daily for 28 days every 6 weeks) or oral S-1 (80 mg/m² daily for 21 days every 5 weeks) plus irinotecan (80 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15 every 5 weeks) (IRI-S).
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included the time to treatment failure, 1- and 2-year survival rates, response rate, and safety. Results: The median survival time with IRI-S versus S-1 monotherapy was 12. 8 versus 10.
randomized controlled trial	5 months (P = 0. 233), time to treatment failure was 4. 5 versus 3. 6 months (P = 0. 157), and the 1-year survival rate was 52. 0 versus 44. 9%, respectively. The response rate was significantly higher for IRI-S than for S-1 monotherapy (41. 5 vs. 26.
randomized controlled trial	9%, P = 0. 035). Neutropenia and diarrhea occurred more frequently with IRI-S, but were manageable. Patients treated with IRI-S received more courses of therapy at a relative dose intensity similar to that of S-1 monotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: Although IRI-S achieved longer median survival than S-1 monotherapy and was well tolerated, it did not show significant superiority in this study.
randomized controlled trial	Randomized phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 alone as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer (study GC0301/TOP-002)
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: To compare epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatments in patients with advanced gastric or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: This open, randomized, phase III study was carried out in 71 centers.
randomized controlled trial	Patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or EGJ cancer were randomly assigned to receive either ECX as first-line treatment (ECX arm) or FOLFIRI (FOLFIRI arm).
randomized controlled trial	Second-line treatment was predefined (FOLFIRI for the ECX arm and ECX for the FOLFIRI arm). The primary criterion was time-to-treatment failure (TTF) of the first-line therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Secondary criteria were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and quality of life. Results: In all, 416 patients were included (median age, 61. 4 years; 74% male).
randomized controlled trial	After a median follow-up of 31 months, median TTF was significantly longer with FOLFIRI than with ECX (5. 1 v 4. 2 months; P =. 008). There was no significant difference between the two groups in median PFS (5. 3 v 5. 8 months; P =. 96), median OS (9.
randomized controlled trial	5 v 9. 7 months; P =. 95), or response rate (39. 2% v 37. 8%). First-line FOLFIRI was better tolerated (overall rate of grade 3 to 4 toxicity, 69% v 84%; P <. 001; hematologic adverse events [AEs], 38% v 64. 5%; P <. 001; nonhematologic AEs: 53% v 53.
randomized controlled trial	5%; P =. 81). Conclusion: FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for advanced gastric and EGJ cancer demonstrated significantly better TTF than did ECX.
randomized controlled trial	Other outcome results indicate that FOLFIRI is an acceptable first-line regimen in this setting and should be explored as a backbone regimen for targeted agents.

randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This multicentric, randomized, two-stage phase II trial evaluated three simplified weekly infusional regimens of fluorouracil (FU) or FU plus folinic acid (FA) and cisplatin (Cis) with the aim to select a regimen for future phase III trials.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: A total of 145 patients with advanced gastric cancer where randomly assigned to weekly FU 3,000 mg/m2/24 hours (HD-FU), FU 2,600 mg/m2/24 hours plus dl-FA 500 mg/m2 or l-FA 250 mg/m2 (HD-FU/FA), or FU 2000 mg/m2/24 hours plus FA plus biweekly Cis 50 mg/m2, each administered for 6 weeks with a 1-week rest.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was the response rate. Results: Confirmed responses were observed in 6. 1% (two of 33) of the eligible patients treated with HD-FU, in 25% (12 of 48, including one complete remission [CR]) with HD-FU/FA, and in 45.
randomized controlled trial	7% (21 of 46, including four CRs) with HD-FU/FA/Cis. The HD-FU arm was closed after stage 1 because the required minimum number of responses was not met.
randomized controlled trial	The median progression-free survival of all patients in the HD-FU, HD-FU/FA, and HD-FU/FA/Cis arm was 1. 9, 4. 0, and 6. 1 months, respectively. The median overall survival was 7. 1, 8. 9, and 9. 7 months, and the survival rate at 1 year was 24.
randomized controlled trial	3%, 30. 3%, and 45. 3%, respectively. Grade 4 toxicities were rare. The most relevant grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia in 1. 9%, 5. 4%, and 19. 6%, and diarrhea in 2. 7%, 1. 9%, and 3.
randomized controlled trial	9% of the cycles in the HD-FU, HD-FU/FA, and HD-/FU/Cis arms, respectively. Conclusion: Weekly infusional FU/FA plus biweekly Cis is effective and safe in patients with gastric cancer.

randomized controlled trial	Background: Both cisplatin/capecitabine (CX) and epirubicin plus CX (ECX) have clearly demonstrated efficacy against advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
randomized controlled trial	Methods: Chemotherapy-naïve patients with histologically confirmed, measurable AGC were randomised to receive CX (cisplatin 75mg/m(2) iv on day 1 and capecitabine 1000mg/m(2) bid po on days 1-14) or ECX (epirubicin 50mg/m(2) plus CX) every 3weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Of the 91 registered patients, 45 patients were treated with CX and 44 with ECX. A total of 241 CX (median, 6; range, 1-12) and 201 ECX (median, 5; range, 1-11) cycles were delivered.
randomized controlled trial	Treatment duration was similar for both arms (4. 4 for CX versus 4. 2months for ECX). There was no relevant difference in the occurrence of overall grade 3 or 4 toxicities between the CX and ECX arms (80% versus 78%, respectively; P=0. 516).
randomized controlled trial	However, none in the CX and 12% in the ECX arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity. There were no significant differences in therapeutic efficacy between CX and ECX with respect to the response rate (38% versus 37%, respectively) and PFS (6.
randomized controlled trial	4 versus 6. 5months). Conclusion: Both CX and ECX appear to be active as first-line chemotherapy for AGC, and the safety profiles are acceptable.
randomized controlled trial	Given the comparable efficacy results, CX could be a reasonable standard chemotherapy for untreated AGC patients.
randomized controlled trial	A randomised phase II study of combination chemotherapy with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) or cisplatin and capecitabine (CX) in advanced gastric cancer
meta analysis	We conducted an individual-patient-data meta-analysis of the efficacy of chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced/recurrent gastric cancer (AGC).
meta analysis	Our primary research question was whether the experimental arms of the trials included in the meta-analysis showed a benefit as compared with their corresponding control arms.
meta analysis	MEDLINE (up to 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, National Institutes of Health (NIH) trial registry and proceedings of major oncologic and gastrointestinal cancer meetings were searched.
meta analysis	Randomised controlled trials for AGC closed to patient accrual before the end of 2006 were eligible.
meta analysis	As of December 2010, individual patient data were available from 22 trials (4245 patients, representing 47% of the targeted data) of 55 eligible trials.
meta analysis	The overall comparison of experimental arms with the corresponding control arms showed statistically significant differences in terms of both OS and PFS. Hazard ratio was 0. 88 (95% confidence interval 0. 82-0. 94, P<0. 0001) for OS and 0. 81 (0.
meta analysis	76-0. 88, P<0. 0001) for PFS. The results of the sub-analysis of adding a given chemotherapeutic agent to any chemotherapy confirm the results of the overall analysis, with a hazard reduction of 11% for OS (P<0. 01) and 26% for PFS (P<0. 0001).
meta analysis	This meta-analysis of individual patient data shows that the additions of experimental chemotherapeutic agents to pre-existing control or standard regimens have produced a modest improvement in OS and PFS.
meta analysis	Median survival remained below 1 year for all investigated chemotherapy regimens and none emerged as a clear standard.

randomized controlled trial	Background: We investigated the superiority of docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 compared with cisplatin and S-1 in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Methods: In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, patients were recruited from 56 hospitals in Japan.
randomized controlled trial	We enrolled individuals aged 20-75 years who had unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, had received no previous chemotherapy (except adjuvant chemotherapy completed 24 weeks before reccurence), radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy, could take drugs orally, and had adequate organ function.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 (docetaxel 40 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, and S-1 40-60 mg twice a day orally for 2 weeks, every 4 weeks) or cisplatin and S-1 (cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously on day 8, and S-1 40-60 mg orally twice a day for 3 weeks, every 5 weeks).
randomized controlled trial	Randomisation was done centrally with the minimisation method, with a random component balancing for institution, ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), disease status at enrolment (unresectable vs recurrent), measurable lesion (yes vs no), number of metastatic sites (0-1 vs ≥2), and histological type (differentiated vs undifferentiated).
randomized controlled trial	Neither investigators or patients were masked to the study treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000007652.
randomized controlled trial	Findings: Between April 3, 2012, and March 18, 2016, 741 patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 (n=370) or cisplatin and S-1 (n=371).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival was 14·2 months (95% CI 12·9-15·9) in the docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 group and 15·3 months (14·2-16·2) in the cisplatin and S-1 group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99 [95% CI 0·85-1·16]; one-sided stratified log-rank p=0·47).
randomized controlled trial	The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (209 [59%] of 357 patients in the docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 group vs 117 [32%] of 365 patients in the cisplatin and S-1 group), leukopenia (120 [34%] vs 60 [16%]), and anorexia (94 [26%] vs 81 [22%]).
randomized controlled trial	The deaths of one patient in the cisplatin and S-1 group and in three patients in the docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 group were deemed treatment-related.
randomized controlled trial	Interpretation: The addition of docetaxel to cisplatin and S-1 did not improve overall survival in chemotherapy-naive Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, cisplatin and S-1 remains the standard first-line chemotherapy.

randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel plus cisplatin and S-1 versus cisplatin and S-1 in patients with advanced gastric cancer (JCOG1013): an open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: In the randomized, multinational phase II/III trial (V325) of untreated advanced gastric cancer patients, the phase II part selected docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) over docetaxel and cisplatin for comparison against cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF; reference regimen) in the phase III part.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Advanced gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) plus fluorouracil 750 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (day 1) plus fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 4 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	The primary end point was time-to-progression (TTP). Results: In 445 randomly assigned and treated patients (DCF = 221; CF = 224), TTP was longer with DCF versus CF (32% risk reduction; log-rank P <. 001).
randomized controlled trial	Overall survival was longer with DCF versus CF (23% risk reduction; log-rank P =. 02). Two-year survival rate was 18% with DCF and 9% with CF. Overall response rate was higher with DCF (chi2 P =. 01).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 69% (DCF) v 59% (CF) of patients. Frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities for DCF v CF were: neutropenia (82% v 57%), stomatitis (21% v 27%), diarrhea (19% v 8%), lethargy (19% v 14%).
randomized controlled trial	Complicated neutropenia was more frequent with DCF than CF (29% v 12%). Conclusion: Adding docetaxel to CF significantly improved TTP, survival, and response rate in gastric cancer patients, but resulted in some increase in toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	Incorporation of docetaxel, as in DCF or with other active drug(s), is a new therapy option for patients with untreated advanced gastric cancer.
randomized controlled trial	Phase III study of docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer: a report of the V325 Study Group
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: This randomized phase II trial evaluated two docetaxel-based regimens to see which would be most promising according to overall response rate (ORR) for comparison in a phase III trial with epirubicin-cisplatin-fluorouracil (ECF) as first-line advanced gastric cancer therapy.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Chemotherapy-naïve patients with measurable unresectable and/or metastatic gastric carcinoma, a performance status <or= 1, and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function randomly received <or= eight 3-weekly cycles of ECF (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) on day 1, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil [FU] 200 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 to 21), TC (docetaxel initially 85 mg/m(2) on day 1 [later reduced to 75 mg/m(2) as a result of toxicity] and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1), or TCF (TC plus FU 300 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 to 14).
randomized controlled trial	Study objectives included response (primary), survival, toxicity, and quality of life (QOL). Results: ORR was 25. 0% (95% CI, 13% to 41%) for ECF, 18. 5% (95% CI, 9% to 34%) for TC, and 36. 6% (95% CI, 23% to 53%) for TCF (n = 119).
randomized controlled trial	Median overall survival times were 8. 3, 11. 0, and 10. 4 months for ECF, TC, and TCF, respectively. Toxicity was acceptable, with one toxic death (TC arm).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in more treatment cycles with docetaxel (TC, 49%; TCF, 57%; ECF, 34%). Global health status/QOL substantially improved with ECF and remained similar to baseline with both docetaxel regimens.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: Time to response and ORR favor TCF over TC for further evaluation, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting. A trend towards increased myelosuppression and infectious complications with TCF versus TC or ECF was observed.
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil; docetaxel and cisplatin; and epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil as systemic treatment for advanced gastric carcinoma: a randomized phase II trial of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to define the contribution of docetaxel to combination chemotherapy in the outcome of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
randomized controlled trial	We compared the overall response rate (ORR) and safety of docetaxel plus cisplatin (DC) with DC plus fluorouracil (DCF) to select either DC or DCF as the experimental treatment in the ensuing phase III part of trial V-325.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In this phase II randomized study, untreated patients with confirmed advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received either DCF (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1, and fluorouracil 750 mg/m2/d as continuous infusion on days 1 to 5) or DC (docetaxel 85 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1) every 3 weeks.
randomized controlled trial	An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) was to select one of the two regimens based primarily on ORR and safety profile. Results: Of 158 randomly assigned patients, 155 (DCF, n = 79; DC, n = 76) received treatment.
randomized controlled trial	The confirmed ORR was 43% for DCF (n = 79) and 26% for DC (n = 76). Median time to progression was 5. 9 months for DCF and 5. 0 months for DC. Median overall survival time was 9. 6 months for DCF and 10. 5 months for DC.
randomized controlled trial	The most frequent grade 3 and 4 events per patient included neutropenia (DCF = 86%; DC = 87%) and GI (DCF = 56%; DC = 30%). Conclusion: Both regimens were active, but DCF produced a higher confirmed ORR than DC.
randomized controlled trial	Toxicity profiles of DCF were considered manageable. The IDMC chose DCF for the phase III part of V-325, which compares DCF with cisplatin plus fluorouracil.
randomized controlled trial	Phase II multi-institutional randomized trial of docetaxel plus cisplatin with or without fluorouracil in patients with untreated, advanced gastric, or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: A combination of docetaxel and fluorouracil (DF) was evaluated in an outpatient setting and compared with epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (ECF), which served as an internal control arm to avoid selection bias.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Patients with metastatic or locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma without prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either ECF (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) day 1, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1, and fluorouracil 200 mg/m(2) days 1 through 21, every 3 weeks) or DF (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) day 1, and fluorouracil 200 mg/m(2) days 1 through 21, every 3 weeks).
randomized controlled trial	Results: Ninety patients were randomly assigned. Toxicity was rarely severe. Major toxic effects included diarrhea, stomatitis, and leukopenia in the DF arm and nausea, vomiting, and leukopenia in the ECF arm.
randomized controlled trial	Forty-three of 45 patients in each arm were assessable. In the DF arm, two patients (4. 4%, intent to treat) experienced a confirmed complete tumor remission as best response, and 15 patients (33.
randomized controlled trial	3%) experienced a confirmed partial remission (overall response rate [ORR], 37. 8%; 95% CI, 25. 9% to 51. 9%). Two patients (4. 4%) in the ECF arm showed confirmed complete remission, and 14 (31. 1%) showed confirmed partial remission (ORR, 35.
randomized controlled trial	6%; 95% CI, 24. 8% to 48. 7%). For the DF and ECF arms, the median survival was 9. 5 and 9. 7 months, and the median time to tumor progression 5. 5 and 5. 3 months, respectively. Conclusion: DF can be safely given in an ambulant setting.
randomized controlled trial	Compared with ECF, the dual combination of DF shows promising efficacy and may be an alternative treatment option that avoids cisplatin.
randomized controlled trial	Docetaxel and continuous-infusion fluorouracil versus epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma: a randomized phase II study
randomized controlled trial	Background: Docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-flurouracil (DCF) administered every 3 weeks produces a high rate of treatment-related adverse events.
randomized controlled trial	The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a weekly formulation of DCF. Methods: Data from 117 patients treated at The University of Texas M. D.
randomized controlled trial	Anderson Cancer Center from 2002 to 2006 with a weekly formulation of DCF were retrospectively collected.
randomized controlled trial	A total of 95 patients received front-line therapy with 20 mg/m(2) of cisplatin, 350 mg/m(2) of 5-fluorouracil, and 20 mg/m(2) of docetaxel administered once weekly for 6 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week break.
randomized controlled trial	Results: Ninety-five patients (median age, 62 years [range, 33 to 87 years], with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or 2 in 67%) received a median of 10 weeks of DCF treatment (range, 3-41 weeks).
randomized controlled trial	Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3. 0]) included granulocytopenia (4 patients) and anemia (9 patients).
randomized controlled trial	None of the patients developed a febrile neutropenic infection, but grade 3 or 4 non-neutropenic infections occurred in 8 patients.
randomized controlled trial	Eighty patients had measurable disease with an objective response rate determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria of 34% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 24-45%).
randomized controlled trial	The median follow-up was 9 months, with a median time to disease progression of 4. 1 months (95% CI, 3. 6-5. 7 months) and a median overall survival of 8. 9 months (95% CI, 7. 7-10. 8 months).
randomized controlled trial	Conclusions: In patients with advanced gastric and esophageal cancer who were not candidates for every-3-week DCF, a weekly formulation of DCF demonstrated modest activity with minimal hematologic toxicity, suggesting that weekly DCF is a reasonable treatment option for such patients.
randomized controlled trial	Weekly docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil as initial therapy for patients with advanced gastric and esophageal cancer
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: For patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer (AGGEC) providing clinical benefit with improved palliation is highly desirable.
randomized controlled trial	However, a prospective evaluation of clinical benefit in AGGEC patients has never before been reported in a phase III setting.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: In a multinational trial (V325), 445 patients were randomly assigned and treated with either docetaxel plus cisplatin and fluorouracil (DCF) or cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF).
randomized controlled trial	Clinical benefit was prospectively evaluated in this trial as a secondary end point. The primary measure for clinical benefit analysis was time to definitive worsening by one or more categories of Karnofsky performance status (KPS).
randomized controlled trial	Secondary clinical benefit end points included time to 5% definitive weight loss, time to definitive worsening of appetite by one grade, pain-free survival (defined as time to first appearance of pain), and time to first cancer pain-related opioid intake.
randomized controlled trial	Clinical benefit assessments were recorded at each clinic visit. Results: Clinical benefit assessments were performed in more than 75% of patients throughout V325.
randomized controlled trial	DCF significantly prolonged time to definitive worsening of KPS compared with CF (median, 6. 1 v 4. 8 months; hazard ratio, 1. 38; 95% CI, 1. 08 to 1. 76; log-rank P =. 009).
randomized controlled trial	Although time to definitive weight loss and time to definitive worsening of appetite favored DCF, the results were not statistically significant. Pain-free survival and time to first cancer pain-related opioid intake were comparable.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: To our knowledge, V325 is the first phase III trial to report clinical benefit in AGGEC patients. Clinical benefit was assessed beyond protocol-specific chemotherapy.
randomized controlled trial	The addition of D to CF not only significantly improved clinical benefit but also improved quality of life, time to progression, and overall survival compared with CF.
randomized controlled trial	Clinical benefit with docetaxel plus fluorouracil and cisplatin compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil in a phase III trial of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer adenocarcinoma: the V-325 Study Group
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Therapy of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should provide symptom relief and improve quality of life (QOL) because most patients are symptomatic at baseline.
randomized controlled trial	Using validated instruments, we prospectively assessed QOL (even after completion of protocol treatment) as one of the secondary end points of the V325 phase III trial.
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: Four hundred forty-five patients randomly received either docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) each on day 1 plus fluorouracil 750 mg/m(2)/d continuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks (DCF) or cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d continuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 4 weeks (CF).
randomized controlled trial	The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and, where available, the EuroQOL EQ-5D questionnaire were administered every 8 weeks from baseline until progression and then every 3 months.
randomized controlled trial	Time to definitive deterioration of QOL parameters was analyzed. Results: The proportions of patients having assessable EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D questionnaires at baseline were 86. 0% and 78. 7% with DCF, respectively, and 89. 7% and 92.
randomized controlled trial	8% with CF, respectively. Time to 5% deterioration of global health status (primary end point) significantly favored DCF over CF (log-rank test, P =. 01).
randomized controlled trial	QOL was preserved longer for patients on DCF than those on CF for all time to deterioration analyses, demonstrating the statistical superiority of DCF compared with CF.
randomized controlled trial	Conclusion: V325 represents the largest trial with the longest prospectively controlled evaluations of QOL during protocol chemotherapy and follow-up in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
randomized controlled trial	In V325, advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer patients receiving DCF not only had statistically improved overall survival and time to tumor-progression, but they also had better preservation of QOL compared with patients receiving CF.
randomized controlled trial	Quality of life with docetaxel plus cisplatin and fluorouracil compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil from a phase III trial for advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: the V-325 Study Group
randomized controlled trial	The optimal first-line palliative systemic treatment strategy for metastatic esophagogastric cancer is not well defined.
randomized controlled trial	The aim of our study was to explore real-world use of first-line systemic treatment in esophagogastric cancer and assess the effect of treatment strategy on overall survival (OS), time to failure (TTF) of first-line treatment and toxicity.
randomized controlled trial	We selected synchronous metastatic esophagogastric cancer patients treated with systemic therapy (2010-2016) from the nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry (n = 2,204).
randomized controlled trial	Systemic treatment strategies were divided into monotherapy, doublet and triplet chemotherapy, and trastuzumab-containing regimens.
randomized controlled trial	Data on OS were available for all patients, on TTF for patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 (n = 1,700), and on toxicity for patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2014 (n = 1,221).
randomized controlled trial	OS and TTF were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression, with adjustment for relevant tumor and patient characteristics. Up to 45 different systemic treatment regimens were found to be administered, with a median TTF of 4. 6 and OS of 7. 5 months.
randomized controlled trial	Most patients (45%) were treated with doublet chemotherapy; 34% received triplets, 10% monotherapy and 10% a trastuzumab-containing regimen. The highest median OS was found in patients receiving a trastuzumab-containing regimen (11. 9 months).
randomized controlled trial	Triplet chemotherapy showed equal survival rates compared to doublets (OS: HR 0. 92, 95%CI 0. 83-1. 02; TTF: HR 0. 92, 95%CI 0. 82-1. 04) but significantly more grade 3-5 toxicity than doublets (33% vs. 21%, respectively).
randomized controlled trial	In conclusion, heterogeneity of first-line palliative systemic treatment in metastatic esophagogastric cancer patients is striking.
randomized controlled trial	Based on our data, doublet chemotherapy is the preferred treatment strategy because of similar survival and less toxicity compared to triplets.
