meta analysis	Background: It is unclear if differential chemotherapy effects exist on overall survival (OS), response rate (RR) and toxicity depending on primary tumour origin [oesophageal versus oesophago-gastric junction (OGJ) versus gastric adenocarcinoma].
meta analysis	Patients and methods: A total of 2110 patients were enrolled in four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing fluoropyrimidine +/- platinum-based chemotherapy.
meta analysis	This analysis used individual patient data and restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma who received one or more dose of chemotherapy. Gastric origin was the control in comparisons of tumour origin.
meta analysis	Results: Of the 2110 patients randomised, 1775 (84%) patients had adenocarcinoma with oesophageal (n = 485), OGJ (n = 457) and gastric (n = 833) origins. The median OS was 9. 5 months in oesophageal, 9. 3 months in OGJ and 8.
Cross-sectional study	Although malnutrition is known to be frequent in cancer patients, it has not been described in a selected population of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies under chemotherapy only.
Cross-sectional study	Physician judgment about malnutrition and risk factors for malnutrition were also evaluated.
Cross-sectional study	All consecutive in- and outpatients of 11 centers were prospectively enrolled in a cross-sectional 14-day period study and classified according to the French health recommendations [Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)].
Cross-sectional study	Among 313 patients enrolled in 11 centers (mean age = 63 yr; range = 21-93; 67% male) mainly with colorectal (58%), pancreatic (15%), gastric (11%), and hepatobiliary (10%) primary tumors, the prevalence of malnutrition was 52%.
review	Oesophageal cancer is a debilitating disease with a poor prognosis, and weight loss owing to malnutrition prevails in the majority of patients.
review	Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the loss of fat and skeletal muscle mass and systemic inflammation arising from complex host-tumour interactions is a major contributor to malnutrition, which is a determinant of tolerance to treatment and survival.
review	In patients with oesophageal cancer, cachexia is further compounded by eating difficulties owing to the stage and location of the tumour, and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy.
review	Treatment with curative intent involves exceptionally extensive and invasive surgery, and the subsequent anatomical changes often lead to eating difficulties and severe postoperative malnutrition.
Case series	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of psychological distress in gastric cancer patients.
Case series	Methods: The study population included 229 gastric cancer patients visiting Yonsei Cancer Center between November 2009 and March 2011.
Case series	The distress was measured by available tools including the Modified Distress Thermometer (MDT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).
Case series	Patients with psychological distress were defined as those who scored above the cut-off values in both the MDT and either one of the HADS or CES-D. Results: The median age of patients was 56 (range, 20 to 86) and 97 (42.
randomized controlled trial	Purpose: Effective interventions to improve prognosis in metastatic esophagogastric cancer (EGC) are urgently needed.
randomized controlled trial	We assessed the effect of the early integration of interdisciplinary supportive care for patients with metastatic EGC on overall survival (OS).
randomized controlled trial	Patients and methods: An open-label, phase III, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Patients with previously untreated metastatic EGC were enrolled.
randomized controlled trial	Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either early interdisciplinary supportive care (ESC) integrated into standard oncologic care or standard care (SC).
Cohort study	Purpose: Trastuzumab is the only approved targeted drug for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). However, not all patients respond and most eventually progress.
Cohort study	The multicenter VARIANZ study aimed to investigate the background of response and resistance to trastuzumab in mGC. Methods: Patients receiving medical treatment for mGC were prospectively recruited in 35 German sites and followed for up to 48 months.
Cohort study	HER2 status was assessed centrally by immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridization. In addition, HER2 gene expression was assessed using qPCR.
Cohort study	Results: Five hundred forty-eight patients were enrolled, and 77 had HER2+ mGC by central assessment (14. 1%). A high deviation rate of 22. 7% between central and local test results was seen.
Case-control study	Background: Several risk factors have been identified for esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, but no study has comprehensively examined their contributions to the cancer burden in the general population.
Case-control study	Herein, we estimate the population attributable risks (PARs) for various risk factors observed in a multicenter population-based case-control study.
Case-control study	Methods: We calculated PARs by using 293 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 261 with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, 221 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 368 with noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and 695 control subjects.
Case-control study	We included smoking for all four tumor types and Helicobacter pylori infection for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma as established causal risk factors as well as several other factors for which causality is under evaluation.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed promising efficacy for local failure after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for esophageal cancer. However, PDT required long sun shade period.
Non-randomized controlled trial	This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PDT using second generation photosensitizer, talaporfin sodium for local failure after CRT. This was the multi-institutional non-randomized phase II study.
Non-randomized controlled trial	Patients with histologically proven local failure limited within the muscularis propria after 50Gy or more radiotherapy (RT) for esophageal cancer were eligible. We set the primary endpoint as local complete response (L-CR) per patients.
Non-randomized controlled trial	And, secondary endpoints were confirmed L-CR, local progression free survival (L-PFS), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), L-CR per lesions (Lesion L-CR), and confirmed Lesion L-CR.
case report	Germline mutations in the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene cause autosomal-dominant conditions such as Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes with variable presentations, including hamartomatous gastrointestinal tumors, dermatologic abnormalities, neurologic symptoms, and elevated cancer risk.
case report	We describe a father and son with extensive hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyposis who both developed early-onset esophageal cancer. Exome sequencing identified a novel germline PTEN frameshift mutation (c. 568_569insC, p. V191Sfs*11).
case report	In addition, a missense mutation of SMAD7 (c. 115G>A, p. G39R) with an allele frequency of 0. 3% in the Exome Variant Server was detected in both affected individuals.
case report	Fluorescence in situ hybridization for PTEN in the resected esophageal cancer specimen demonstrated no PTEN copy loss in malignant cells; however, results of an immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a loss of PTEN protein expression.
Before and after control trial	Objectives: Sleep is a major lifestyle factor that may change dramatically when students begin college. Sleep duration has been shown to influence cardiometabolic health.
Before and after control trial	We investigated the feasibility of sleep extension in college students to increase actigraphically measured sleep duration and the association of sleep extension with daytime sleepiness and blood pressure.
Before and after control trial	Design: This was a within-participant experimental study. Setting: The study setting was 14-day at-home study and 3 in-lab visits. Participants: The participants included in this study were healthy undergraduate students (n=53; mean age 20. 5 ± 1.
Before and after control trial	1 years; 70% female). Intervention: Participants maintained a habitual sleep schedule during week 1 and then were instructed to extend their sleep duration by at least 1 hour per night for week 2.
